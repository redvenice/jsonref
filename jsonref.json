Pregnant...Share this article    Prince Harry has ignored the torrential rain to deliver an inspiring speech dedicated to Australia\u0027s struggling farmers          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex visited Dubbo\u0027s Victoria Park on Wednesday afternoon where a huge crowd had turned out to see the royal couple           The couple\u0027s trip to central New South Wales drew  came just days after the announcement that Meghan (pictured) is pregnant          An excited crowd of 15,000 locals turned out to get up close and personal with the royal couple in the wake of their pregnancy announcement \u0027Sixty-four years ago my grandparents, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were right here visiting all of you. It\u0027s a great pleasure to be able to visit this area now and be able to report back how much life has changed in the Great Western plains region since then,\u0027 Prince Harry said in his speech at Dubbo\u0027s Victoria Park.  \u0027Coming here brings back memories of 2003 when I spent some time on a small 16,000 hectare property in Roma in Queensland chasing cows through the bush... and it was great - I perfected the great Aussie salute.\u0027The greatest part about visiting country Australia is the people. You are the salt to of the earth: honest, hardworking and as tough as they come. That resilience, sense of humour and commitment to the land are what make you unique.\u0027You are the backbone of this country.\u0027 To laughter from the crowd, the drenched prince said: \u0027Despite recent welcome rain, it is going to take a lot more and a long time to recover.\u0027You are all the toughest people out there, the most persistent, the ones who can weather the storm or the drought.\u0027Prince Harry said while rural Australians had a lot to be proud of, \u0027I know that life has not been easy\u0027, in reference to the devastating drought.\u0027It must be hard not to lose hope when you endure so many dry months knowing you are powerless to do anything about it,\u0027 the Duke of Sussex said.\u0027The rich traditions of the Australian outback are legendary. You have a lot to be proud of. But I know that life has not been easy. You have just lived through two years of drought.\u0027And despite welcome rain it\u0027s going to take a lot more and a long time to recover. \u0027People in many farming communities generally don\u0027t feed themselves before they need, they are often more isolated, social networks are smaller and there is still a stigma surrounding mental health.          Prince Harry said while rural Australians had a lot to be proud of, \u0027I know that life has not been easy\u0027, mentioning the devastating drought          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were gifted a boomerang after his speech during the couple\u0027s visit to Dubbo          Prince Harry pretends to throw a boomerang gifted to him after his speech in Dubbo, in regional New South Wales          Prince Harry tries to encourage a jumping dog to scale a wall during his visit to Dubbo          Harry and Meghan began their visit by watching a display of jumping dogs – with the Duke trying his hand at beckoning a canine over a wall\u0027We know that suicide rates in rural and remote areas are greater than in urban populations and this may especially be true among young men in remote regions.\u0027But outside all of that, here\u0027s what I also know. You are one huge community and with that comes an unparalleled level of internal support and understanding.   \u0027All you need to do is ask for it... chances are they may well be suffering too, and will relish the opportunity to either listen or talk themselves. You need to know a part of being strong and tough is having the courage to ask for help when you need it. You must not silently suffer.\u0027If I may speak personally, we are all in this together, because asking for help was one of the best decisions that I ever made. You will be continually amazed how life changes for the better.\u0027Prince Harry said the royal couple have been \u0027impressed and inspired\u0027 by stories of Australians rallying together to help one another during adversity.\u0027Your culture of mateship and reputation for looking out for each other ensures that when people are ready to ask for help they will be heard.\u0027          Prince Harry said the royal couple have been \u0027impressed and inspired\u0027 by stories of Australians rallying together to help one another during adversity          The couple received an array of gifts during their visit, from traditional clapping sticks offered by dignitaries through to a can of Dubbo Royale lager          Prince Harry and Meghan visit the Clontarf Foundation and Girls Academy at Dubbo College during the couple\u0027s royal tourHe said the couple had enjoyed their time in Dubbo, known as the \u0027city of smiles\u0027.\u0027Dubbo, I am told is now a popular tourist destination renowned for its zoo, festivals, boutique wineries and the old Dubbo jail. \u0027The quality of lives and shared values of people here in rural and regional Australia are very special.\u0027 Harry and Meghan began their visit by watching a display of jumping dogs – with the Duke trying his hand at beckoning a canine over a wall – before meeting members of Team Rubicon, an organisation for veterans which uses disaster response to help former service people back into civilian life.The couple received an array of gifts during their visit, from traditional Aboriginal clapping sticks offered by dignitaries, through to a can of Dubbo Royale lager designed for their visit.Prince Harry and Meghan visit drought ravaged farmers in DubboMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Police launch crime scene outside flat where father beaten to death\u0027Hit it between the eyes\u0027: hunters shoot at elephants in NamibiaHarry and Meghan board a private plane to DubboPM could extend Brexit transition by \u0027a matter of months\u0027Sheffield couple given one week to dig up \u0027dangerous\u0027 flower bedsCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayPolice is at Westfield shopping centre after man fell from top floorCCTV captures woman taking a package from doorstepPrince Harry and Meghan Markle get acquainted with Aussie herbs    Five-year-old Luke Vincent managed to stroke Prince Harry\u0027s beard after the royal arrived in Dubbo, stealing the show after the royal couple shook hands with every single student on the tarmac          Luke, who was among schoolchildren who greeted the royal couple at Dubbo Airport on Wednesday morning, received a hug from Prince Harry           The kindergarten student had waited at the very end of the line to met the royal couple who are spending Wednesday in the regional city of Dubbo\u0027We gave him a can of special brew,\u0027 said Peter West, 62, from the city.\u0027It\u0027s a mixture from her town in America and his in England.\u0027It\u0027s beautiful.

Luke\u0027s favourite person in the world is Santa Claus, who has a beard. So he rubbed Harry\u0027s beard,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s been a wonderful experience for these little country kids to meet people they\u0027ve only ever seen on TV.\u0027            The Duke and Duchess of Sussex made a new best friend when they touched down in the drought-stricken regional city          The Duke and Duchess spent time with Luke after they arrived in Dubbo for the second full day of their Australian tour           The royal couple were visibly delighted to meet with five-year-old Luke during their tour of Dubbo in Wednesday           The youngster, who was sporting green glasses and a checkered cap with his school uniform, had also handed the Duchess of Sussex a bouquet of flowers          Luke\u0027s school uploaded a picture of the youngster travelling on the bus on the way to meet the royal couple at the airportForecast rain held off while the children jumped up and down with anticipation, cheering as the couple came down the steps from their RAAF jet for the second full day of their royal tour.Despite running behind schedule, Harry and Meghan took their time with the school children, the Prince bouncing around energetically and Meghan kneeling down to speak to them.Ms Van Dartel said of the royal couple\u0027s visit to Dubbo, whose farming community has been hit by the devastating drought in recent months: \u0027This is a real morale boost\u0027.James Fogg, 11, from Eumungerie Public School, which has just nine pupils, told Harry he wanted to be a helicopter pilot, with the Duke replying: \u0027Good choice, good man\u0027. \u0027This is so exciting for Dubbo.

Prince Harry was wearing a grey-blue shirt and trousers. Also in the line-up was Troy Grant MP, the member for Dubbo and minister for police and emergency services, and his wife Toni.Previous royal visitors to Dubbo have included Edward, Prince of Wales, in 1920, the Queen in 1954 and 1992 and Prince Edward in 2006.   The farming region got barely any rain through the winter and has been blighted by temperatures in excess of 45C leading to the death of thousands of cattle, loss of livelihood and severe food shortages. Some areas have experienced the driest spell since records began in 1900. Prince Harry and Meghan  visited the Royal Flying Doctor Service after their arrival to learn more about the life-saving role the aviation service provides for people living in remote areas.   There, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex met a hero medic who pulled three survivors from a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex unveiled a new aircraft for the Royal Flying Doctor Service while in Dubbo          The royal couple were greeted by signs including \u0027Dubbo loves Harry and Meghan\u0027 as they toured the Royal Flying Doctor Service\u0027s Dubbo facility           Before leaving the Royal Flying Doctor Service facility in Dubbo, the couple cut a cake marking the 90th anniversary of the serviceMarcus Wilson, 47, an ex-soldier who was running a medical service at the time, was awarded Australia\u0027s Bravery Medal for his actions. Inspired by Prince Harry, Mr Wilson will be taking part in the Invictus Games in the sailing event.Now manager of the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Broken Hill, about 1500 km from Sydney, Mr Wilson spent 14 years in the military - first as a gunner, then as a medic - before setting up a medical evacuation service for aid workers in Afghanistan.He was at NATO HQ in Kabul in October 2015 when a helicopter crashed near where he was standing.\u0027It missed me by 15-20 feet,\u0027 Mr Wilson, who met the couple at a RFDS event in Dubbo, said. \u0027It was an intense experience.\u0027I was the first on the scene. I got people to get fire extinguishers and then spent one and a half hours retrieving the deceased and survivors from the wreckage, crawling through the air frame. The space that we crawled through was 35cm high. It was ankle deep in fuel.\u0027Because everything collapsed we had to use bolt cutters. We could not use saws because of the fuel.\u0027Five died - two RAF crew and three contractors - and four survived. Mr Wilson, who was one of three rescuers, added: \u0027It was terrifying. If it caught on fire - there was absolutely no escape.\u0027Mr Wilson said he went inside the helicopter because he was older than most people at the scene.           Dubbo crowds await the arrival of Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex at a picnic in Victoria Park          The hundreds of people had waited for hours to catch a glimpse of the royal couple in the regional city \u0027I had had a chance to live my life. I didn\u0027t want other people to take the risk that I felt I should take.\u0027Medically discharged from the army because of a spinal injury, and traumatised by the helicopter crash, Mr Wilson found himself at a loss after leaving Afghanistan. Then he watched the Invictus Games in Toronto, and volunteered for the Sydney games. \u0027I have seen how much it has impacted not just on me but other team members and their families,\u0027 Mr Wilson said.At the RFDS event, which saw a new aircraft being delivered as the service marked its 90th anniversary, the Duke and Duchess also met patients including Keiley Storer, three, who has suffered from a larynx condition which blocks her airway.She gave the Duchess a posy. It turned out to be a two-way transaction.Her mother Melissa, 34, said: \u0027She said, \u0027Would you like one too?\u0027 and gave her the white one. Then she saw Keiley looking and said, \u0027Would you like the big pink one?\u0027\u0027But Keiley got distressed that she pulled apart the posy.\u0027Her father Christopher said: \u0027She shed some tears shortly after. It was, \u0027Oh no, my posy\u0027.\u0027          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are showing their support for farming families affected by one of Australia\u0027s worst ever droughts while in Dubbo          The family explained how they have adapted to the drought, before inviting Harry and Meghan for morning tea at the homestead with their family          The Duke and Duchess later met the Woodley family, who have operated a mixed sheep, cattle and cropping enterprise over five generations since 1887Prince Harry and Meghan visit drought ravaged farmers in DubboMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Police launch crime scene outside flat where father beaten to death\u0027Hit it between the eyes\u0027: hunters shoot at elephants in NamibiaHarry and Meghan board a private plane to DubboPM could extend Brexit transition by \u0027a matter of months\u0027Sheffield couple given one week to dig up \u0027dangerous\u0027 flower bedsCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayPolice is at Westfield shopping centre after man fell from top floorCCTV captures woman taking a package from doorstepPrince Harry and Meghan Markle get acquainted with Aussie herbsThe couple also met nurses and other staff and volunteers from the service. David Charlton, RFDS aviation general manager, said told the expecting couple that they deliver babies mid-flight several times each year.\u0027Our staff thought at was quite interesting, given the couple\u0027s current condition. The couple found it most amusing, and interesting. We all wanted to ask if it was a boy or a girl, but everyone behaved themselves.\u0027Before leaving, the couple cut a cake marking the anniversary. Harry gave it a good sniff, and helped himself to a bit of icing. \u0027He licked the icing from the knife,\u0027 Mr Charlton said. \u0027Which in Australian parlance \u0027is going straight to the pool room\u0027.\u0027The Duke and Duchess later met the Woodley family, who have operated a mixed sheep, cattle and cropping enterprise over five generations since 1887. Scott and Elaine Woodley, who farm alongside their 23-year-old daughter Laura, took Their Royal Highnesses on a short tour of the farm, including to the paddock where the Duke and Duchess had an opportunity to help feed the cattle.   Scott and Elaine Woodley, who farm full time alongside their 23-year-old daughter Laura, took Their Royal Highnesses on a short tour of the farm          The Duchess of Sussex whipped up a loaf of banana bread to take with her on a visit to a farm to highlight the plight of farmers hit by drought          Pregnant Meghan, 37, cooked the delicious treat in the kitchen at Admiralty House on Tuesday night following her first full day of engagements in SydneyFollowing the rule that a guest should never arrive empty handed, the Duchess had whipped up a loaf of banana bread to take with her.Meghan, 37, cooked up the treat - an Australian favourite - in the kitchen at Admiralty House, the home of the Governor-General of Australia, on Tuesday night following her first full day of engagements in Sydney.She took the cake, packed with chocolate chips and a touch of ginger, with her to Mountain View Farm.An aide said: \u0027She loves baking and just decided to take something along with her on the spur of the moment.The duchess also took along the perfect accompaniment- a tin of Fortnum and Mason \u0027Royal Blend\u0027 tea.Before the Duchess had even left, only a quarter of the loaf remained.Benita Woodley, 20, the daughter of Scott and Elaine declared it delicious: \u0027It was such a nice and thoughtful thing for her to do.

Prince Harry takes Meghan (and his Akubra) to rural Australia – 15 years after he spent his gap year working on a remote stationBy Kylie Stevens for Daily Mail Australia Prince Harry and The Duchess of Sussex have touched down for some fresh country air in rural Australia, bringing their Akubras with them to fit in with the locals.But the prince is no stranger to donning the iconic Australian hat.Their whirlwind visit to Dubbo in central New South Wales on Wednesday brings back vivid memories Prince Harry has of his time in country Australia 15 years ago.          Prince Harry, pictured in the Queensland outback in 2003, has very fond memories of rural AustraliaAfter graduating from Eton, Prince Harry, then 19, spent his gap year in 2003 working as a jackaroo at Tooloombilla Station, a sprawling 16,000 hectare cattle property 150 kilomtres northwest of Roma in outback Central Queensland.The station was owned at the time by Annie and Noel Hill, who were friends of his late mother Princess Diana.Mr Hill was the son of millionaire polo star Sinclair Hill, who coached Harry\u0027s father Prince Charles.Prince Harry spent three months working at the station and earned the very unprincely sum of $212.63 a week after tax.Working from 7.30am until 6pm, his duties include mustering cattle and mending fences, The Daily Telegraph reported at the time.He also found time to jet around Australia to a few Rugby World Cup games to cheer on his beloved England, who memorably won the tournament following a dramatic extra-time win against Australia in the final.          Prince Harry looked very much the seasoned stockman during his three month stint as a jackaroo at Tooloombilla Station in 2003          It\u0027s understood Prince Harry earned the very unprincely sum of $212.63 a week after tax\u0027I have had a great time working out here, meeting people and learning a bit about how to be a jackaroo,\u0027 Prince Harry said in a statement at the time.\u0027And of course the rugby was absolutely fantastic. It\u0027s a great country.\u0027One major downside to the working holiday was the lack of privacy and being under frequent public scrutiny with media crews permanently camped outside the station.There were reports the prince contemplated cutting short his three-month Australian adventure as a result.\u0027Learning about the farm and the jackaroo trade, that\u0027s what he wants to do, not dodge the cameras,\u0027 Prince Charles\u0027 press secretary Colleen Harris said at the time.Lib McEwan, wife of Injune Hotel licensee John McEwan added: \u0027I think our locals are starting to get a bit defensive because they\u0027re feeling sorry for him. The media is spoiling the whole deal that was supposed to happen.\u0027          Prince Harry developed a strong bond with Guardsman during his time on the station          Prince Harry was just 19 when he worked on an Australian outback cattle station for Annie and Noel Hill, friends of his late mother Princess Diana"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/16/04/5159E7BC00000578-0-image-a-21_1539661982945.jpg","title":"Samantha Markle says jumping joy Meghan pregnancy announcement","story":"Baby on the way: Meghan Markle\u0027s controversial sister has told DailyMailTV she feels nothing but happiness for the royal couple after learning they are expecting their first child          Supportive sister: Samantha Markle, 53, says she was \u0027jumping for joy\u0027 in her wheelchair after hearing the news and has called for the Markle family to set aside their beef and come together for the new babyThe mom-of-three has previously been one of the most outspoken members of the Markle clan and has made a number of attacks on the Duchess of Sussex in the media over her treatment of their father, Thomas Markle Sr.Less than two weeks ago, she was pictured delivering a letter to Kensington Palace that contained a plea for Meghan to make things up with the retired lighting director, 74.Meghan and her father have not spoken since the royal wedding in May when he was forced to pull out after suffering a heart attack amid a staged paparazzi photo scandal. But Samantha told DailyMailTV that the baby news has changed everything and is now calling for the whole family to stop fighting and unite around her future niece or nephew.  She said: \u0027I think everybody really just needs to come together and realize this is really important and special for Meg, for Harry, for the child, for all of us, and we need to stop the sparring.\u0027I want things to be alright in my family and everybody has to be on the same page.

But Harry and Meghan got straight to work when they were greeted by the Governor of Victoria, Linda Dessau, and her husband Anthony QC, who took them inside for a private meeting.Ten minutes later the couple re-emerged and were escorted across Government House\u0027s West where they were able to see a display put on by Victoria\u0027s This Girl Can empowerment campaign, which encourages everyday women to get active however, wherever and whenever they want without being judged.The couple were presented with a display of 150 women showcasing a number of activities, including netball, yoga, boxercise, cricket, cycling and Zumba.

She enjoyed being around women who want to make a change.\u0027She described her as a \u0027role model\u0027 and added: \u0027She was really engaged. She has done a lot of work in the background with women\u0027s empowerment and it was good to see her coming along and seeing people in local communities making a change.\u0027After walking around the presentation, the couple - who had spit up to view different areas of the display - reunited to walk inside Government House to meet young people involved in a number of innovative and entrepreneurial programmes developed by young people in the Victoria region.First up was the Man Cave - a preventative mental health program for teenage boys, which was founded by Queens Young Leader Hunter Johnson.\u0027There\u0027s a familiar face,\u0027 Meghan said as she reached out to shake the CEO\u0027s hand. Harry also made a beeline to greet Johnson, who quickly thanked the Duke for his support.The conversation quickly turned to Harry\u0027s speech in Dubbo on Wednesday, where he delivered an emotional message to Australian farmers and opened up about depression and mental health issues.\u0027So many young much are suffering from these problems without even realising,\u0027 Harry remarked.Also representing Man Cave was 14-year-old Rupert Grant, a student from Melbourne Grammar School who had been involved with the programme through his school after experiencing a \u0027tough time\u0027 in school. After explaining how the programme had made an impact on life for him and his friends, Meghan remarked, \u0027You\u0027re quite the spokesman!\u0027          Prince Harry and Meghan started model Formula 1 cars at demonstration held at Government House in Melbourne          Harry and Meghan have now arrived at Government House, where they were greeted by Victorian Governor Linda Dessau\u0027We really need more global leaders like Harry,\u0027 Johnson later shared. \u0027There is a change happening among men now, a focus on healthy masculinity and having his support is a real badge of honour.\u0027I thanked Harry for his role modelling and leadership - and we spoke about his incredible words in Dubbo. When I said that the Duchess looked up him proudly.\u0027It\u0027s important that as men we address these issues, that we\u0027re not afraid to take the mask off and open up. To have started that conversation in Dubbo yesterday was powerful.\u0027He\u0027s a positive, glass half-full person and has an incredible influence on the younger generation. He is the right role model for young men and boys today.\u0027After meeting the team from Man Cave, the Duke and Duchess moved on to learn more about Aubot, a robot that can help hospitalised children continue to attend school and the disabled attend work.\u0027This is amazing,\u0027 Meghan commented as she waved a hand in front of one of the robots named after its founder and CEO Marita Chang.Harry seemed particularly interested in their next presentation - a vertical, edible \u0027farm\u0027 designed to grow inside Melbourne cafes, restaurants and, one day, people\u0027s homes. \u0027It will be interesting to see one day how this challenges the supermarkets if people are growing these in their homes,\u0027 Prince Harry said of Farmwall, which was co-founded by Melbourne-based Geert Hendrix.\u0027But I hope that these can be produced with farmers in mind too, so they can exist side by side.\u0027Added Meghan, \u0027I like that there is a focus on nutrients.

I got people to get fire extinguishers and then spent one and a half hours retrieving the deceased and survivors from the wreckage, crawling through the air frame. The space that we crawled through was 35cm high. It was ankle deep in fuel.\u0027Because everything collapsed we had to use bolt cutters. We could not use saws because of the fuel.\u0027Five died - two RAF crew and three contractors - and four survived. Mr Wilson, who was one of three rescuers, added: \u0027It was terrifying. If it caught on fire there was absolutely no escape.\u0027Mr Wilson said he went inside the helicopter because he was older than most people at the scene.   \u0027I had had a chance to live my life. I didn\u0027t want other people to take the risk that I felt I should take.\u0027Prince Harry and Meghan visit drought ravaged farmers in DubboMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Police launch crime scene outside flat where father beaten to death\u0027Hit it between the eyes\u0027: hunters shoot at elephants in NamibiaHarry and Meghan board a private plane to DubboPM could extend Brexit transition by \u0027a matter of months\u0027Sheffield couple given one week to dig up \u0027dangerous\u0027 flower bedsCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayPolice is at Westfield shopping centre after man fell from top floorCCTV captures woman taking a package from doorstepPrince Harry and Meghan Markle get acquainted with Aussie herbs      The footage won public approval, with many praising the prince for his genuine gesture    Prince Harry has playfully swatted flies away from a woman who was delivering a speech, prompting his pregnant wife Meghan Markle to burst out laughingMedically discharged from the army because of a spinal injury, and traumatised by the helicopter crash, Mr Wilson found himself at a loss after leaving Afghanistan. Then he watched the Invictus Games in Toronto, and volunteered for the Sydney games. \u0027I have seen how much it has impacted not just on me but other team members and their families.\u0027At the RFDS event, which saw a new aircraft being delivered as the service marked its 90th anniversary, the Duke and Duchess also met patients including Keiley Storer, three, who has suffered from a larynx condition which blocks her airway.She gave the Duchess a posy. It turned out to be a two-way transaction.Her mother Melissa, 34, said: \u0027She said, \u0027Would you like one too?\u0027 and gave her the white one. Then she saw Keiley looking and said, \u0027Would you like the big pink one?\u0027 \u0027But Keiley got distressed that she pulled apart the posy.\u0027Her father Christopher said: \u0027She shed some tears shortly after. It was, \u0027Oh no, my posy\u0027. The couple also met nurses and other staff and volunteers from the service. David Charlton, RFDS aviation general manager, said they talked about how a few times a year babies are sometimes born mid-flight. \u0027Our staff thought at was quite interesting, given the couple\u0027s current condition.

We are really touched\u0027. As they left the farm, the heavens opened for the first downpour of rain in three weeks. Kate Woodley said the farm had “barely any rain for seven or eight months”. They moved on to Dubbo’s Victoria Park where The Duke of Sussex praised Dubbo’s resistance and hardiness in dealing with recent hard droughts in a speech as the rains poured in the city.Harry joked “I’ve got my wife” as he was offered an umbrella before taking to the lectern at , as Meghan provided shelter from his side.He also quipped that the “rain was a gift” as hundreds of people from the region had turned out to see the royal visitors.The much-needed rain began to fall about 10 minutes before their arrival and only got worse as they saw stalls at the picnic in Victoria Park.He said: “Sixty-four years ago my grandparents, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, were right here visiting the war memorial.“So it’s a great pleasure to be able to visit this area now and be able to report back how much life has changed in the Great Western Plains region since then.”Addressing the crowd, he said: “You people are the salt of the earth, hard working and as tough as they come.“I know that life has not been easy.

The stone came from the same mine in Senhora De Lima’s native Brazil which has provided aquamarines for the Queen.It was not just Diana who enjoyed a special link with the generous Lucia, so too did William and Harry. When she visited Kensington Palace she always brought something for the boys.\u0027Who\u0027s this little cutie?\u0027 What Prince Harry said when he...Meghan masters the art of the tour wardrobe! Pregnant...Share this articleIf it was money, it was often a £50 note. ‘Ooh, a pink Granny,’ the boys would exclaim excitedly, a reference to the Queen’s head on the banknote.Harry never forgot such kindness and, when he and William were making their plans for a statue of their mother as a permanent memorial, they sought the views of Sra De Lima.Sadly, she died last year before the project could be completed. But both boys knew how much she meant to their mother during the years she was in London as the wife of Brazil’s ambassador to the UK, and later in Washington when he was appointed envoy to the U.S.Diana would often talk to Lucia and other friends of her ‘precious boys’ — but particularly of Harry. She adored them both but William, destined to be King, was marked from birth for special attention.As compensation, Diana poured more love and attention into Harry. ‘I have to,’ she would often tell me. ‘Charles and I worked so hard to ensure both boys receive equal amounts of our time and love, but others in the family seem to concentrate on William.’            Princess Diana meets 91-year-old Nellie Corbett at the Lord Gage Centre in NewhamOne day she told me how matters had come to a head with the Queen Mother, with whom the Princess had always had an ambivalent relationship.Harry had complained that whenever he and William visited their great-grandmother at Clarence House, it was always William she made a fuss over and who sat next to her. ‘It’s not fair,’ Harry told his mother.Diana took it up with the Queen Mother explaining, as delicately as possible, that she would prefer it if she didn’t show favouritism to William. For her part, the Queen Mother argued that as William was heir to the throne he should be groomed as such. However, things did change a little. More than anything Diana didn’t want Harry to have a complex about his position in the family.She need not have worried, although slower at learning than William and more sensitive, Harry was a happy-go-lucky boy with a streak of curiosity.William, on the other hand, was slightly aloof, and this made him a little more serious and retiring.Diana empathised with her eldest son’s predicament. ‘He doesn’t want his every move watched,’ Diana would say.Whereas Harry’s attributes, she felt, were better suited for royal duty. She came up with the nickname Good King Harry, GKH for short, which she shared with a handful of friends.How Harry loved it when he was alone with Diana at Kensington Palace. Once, when home ill from boarding school, he gleefully told one of Diana’s friends: ‘I have got Mummy to myself . . . and I don’t have to share her with William!’Quite how many of his childhood memories from the Palace nursery Harry will recall as he becomes a father himself, remains to be seen. But there is one quality he is bound to want to replicate. Diana ensured that the domestic staff and police referred to the boys only by their first names, not as ‘Prince’ and never as ‘Your Royal Highness’.Says her friend Simone Simmons: ‘She knew they need to have a little dose of reality.’Prince Harry and Meghan visit drought ravaged farmers in DubboMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Police launch crime scene outside flat where father beaten to death\u0027Hit it between the eyes\u0027: hunters shoot at elephants in NamibiaHarry and Meghan board a private plane to DubboPM could extend Brexit transition by \u0027a matter of months\u0027Sheffield couple given one week to dig up \u0027dangerous\u0027 flower bedsCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayPolice is at Westfield shopping centre after man fell from top floorCCTV captures woman taking a package from doorstepPrince Harry and Meghan Markle get acquainted with Aussie herbs  Princess Diana in Vancouver, Canada (left) and the Duchess of Sussex in Sydney on Tuesday She smothered them in love and tried to give them an education outside the classroom — hence those visits to the homeless and the sick during their childhood.But for all her efforts how heart-breaking it was to hear Harry recall last year of the times after his parents’ break-up when ‘we never saw our mother enough or we never saw our father enough’.All the same, Diana considered motherhood to be her greatest achievement. As the years pass it is harder and harder to visualise the beautiful young woman who died at 36 as a grandmother four times over, but how she’d have loved to have imparted some of her wisdom to the women who married her sons.She would, of course, have understood Kate’s wish to have her own capable mother, Carole Middleton, on hand for the arrivals of George, Charlotte and Louis, and installed as ‘Granny Number One’.But it may have been impossible to keep her out of the nurseryafter Meghan gave birth. For Harry will be fulfilling a desire his mother once held — becoming parent to a mixed-race child.Diana’s dream was to have a baby with Hasnat Khan, the kindly Pakistan-born heart surgeon with whom she fell in love after watching him operate at London’s Royal Brompton Hospital.And if it was a girl so much the better. For Diana this was no idle fantasy. She believed a child with Muslim Khan could have far-reaching implications for the world. It would help, she reasoned, bring the Muslim and Christian worlds closer together.Prince Harry and Meghan visit drought ravaged farmers in DubboMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Police launch crime scene outside flat where father beaten to death\u0027Hit it between the eyes\u0027: hunters shoot at elephants in NamibiaHarry and Meghan board a private plane to DubboPM could extend Brexit transition by \u0027a matter of months\u0027Sheffield couple given one week to dig up \u0027dangerous\u0027 flower bedsCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayPolice is at Westfield shopping centre after man fell from top floorCCTV captures woman taking a package from doorstepPrince Harry and Meghan Markle get acquainted with Aussie herbs      With them in spirit: The Duchess wears Diana’s butterfly earrings at a Sydney reception            Honour the memory: Meghan also wore Diana\u0027s golden bracelet during the trip to AustraliaIt is tempting to wonder also how Diana would have handled the tragedy of Meghan’s father, the shock of his collusion with a photographer prior to the wedding, the embarrassing interviews and his isolation from his daughter.She treasured her own father and despite several significant differences, they never fell out. When Earl Spencer died suddenly at 68 in 1992, she was heartbroken and many have wondered if his absence helped precipitate her split from Charles that year.Her friends believe Diana would have been on the first flight for a rendezvous with Thomas Markle at his Mexican border hideaway to broker a reconciliation.In many ways, Meghan is the young woman Diana yearned to be, whose successes and achievements she earned for herself, not through marriage into the Royal Family. Despite the global fame it brought her, it was only after her split from Charles that she found a way to use that celebrity and turn it into a meaningful role.But no role would surely have surpassed that of grandmother.   Backups for every piece and detailed plans well in advance: Former royal maid reveals how Meghan Markle\u0027s outfits have been chosen for the tourShe has already wowed fans around the world with two outfit changes on the first official day of the royal tour.But it\u0027s not just the dresses that will be scrutinised over the coming 16 days, but every piece the Duchess of Sussex wears - from an artfully-placed folder to an item of jewellery that originally belonged to her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. Former royal lady\u0027s maid, Alicia Healey, recently revealed how Meghan Markle\u0027s outfits have been chosen for the Invictus Games tour, and just how much preparation went into planning this event.

And, you know, microplastics are a real problem, especially the microplastics from fast-fashion. Did you know that\u0027s one of the biggest culprits?\u0027Bonnie Sheppard, 15, another Albert Park College student, said: \u0027Meghan was really interested in the effect of microplastics. I told her that there are more microplastics in the ocean than stars in the Milky Way, which she was surprised by.\u0027\u0027It\u0027s amazing what you guys are doing,\u0027 said Meghan. \u0027Well done, you\u0027re doing a really great job.

She\u0027s acting great at the moment,\u0027 Morgan said, adding that it was a \u0027red light when people behave like that, in an odd manner\u0027.Stefanovic hit back at Morgan during Thursday morning\u0027s Today show, saying his comments were \u0027disgraceful\u0027.\u0027I think she is an amazing, amazing woman and I think she\u0027s doing her very best at the moment, and she\u0027s got a lot on her plate and is doing it so beautifully,\u0027 Stefanovic said.\u0027She\u0027s such a great export for Great Britain, I mean - what is that guy on?\u0027Morgan replied to Stefanovic\u0027s outburst on Twitter, telling the Channel Nine presenter to \u0027pipe down\u0027.                                                    Carlo Foster, 12, an Albert Park Primary pupil, showed Harry and Meghan bags full of plastic cups, beakers and bottles he has collected. Harry said: \u0027Another worrying thing I\u0027m hearing is some people trying to claim things like these are actually habitats for fish and turtles. Don\u0027t ever let anyone convince you of that.\u0027The couple also spoke to Melisand Box, 14, from Albert Park College, who had a bag filled with plastic straws. She said: \u0027Harry told us to spread the message about whether people really need to use straws at all, and if they do, to use bamboo or metal straws.\u0027Harry and Meghan then did a \u0027mini-walkabout\u0027, greeting dozens of excited schoolchildren who had lined up on the beach to meet them. Among them was Amelia Marcom, 12, from St Kilda Primary school: \u0027I gave Meghan flowers, a picture of her and Harry I\u0027d drawn for them and some t-shirts for the baby. She said she loved them.\u0027Before leaving the beach, the couple strolled hand in hand down to the shoreline, to meet a group of lifeguards from Australia Surf Lifeguards. Sebastian Top, 20, a lifeguard for more than four years, asked Meghan, \u0027Are you going to swim today?\u0027 \u0027Maybe not today,\u0027 she laughed. Harry pointed to a group of around 30 people who had waded into the sea from the beach to get a better view of them: \u0027If we try and swim, I think they might be a bit of a hazard.\u0027 Showing they\u0027re not afraid to get their hands dirty, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will help local schoolchildren pick up litter from South Melbourne beach.Changing into a pair of  Rothy\u0027s flats and a matching black Miguellina Dress, Meghan and her husband made their way onto Melbourne\u0027s iconic mode of transport, along with student leaders at a local school. Arriving at the beach, the couple were fortunate to be greeted not only by roaring crowds, but also a bit of sunshine. Earlier, despite the royal couple arriving 20 minutes late for their first engagement of the day, the crowd of around 5,000 showed no sign of dampening their enthusiasm, gripped by \u0027Meg-Mania\u0027.           Harry and Meghan wave to the well-wishers after taking a ride on a tram in Melbourne          On the way to the beach Meghan smiled and showed Harry a little stuffed toy as the rode the tram in Melbourne          The couple took Melbourne\u0027s iconic tram system to the beach, catching it with student leaders at a local school          After lunch, the Duke and Duchess made a quick wardrobe change, the latter changing from heels to flats          Prince Harry also changed from the navy suit which originally matched his wife\u0027s outfit into a grey jacket and black trousers          The couple were also treated to lunch at Fitzroy\u0027s Charcoal Lane, which offers Aboriginal youths employment          Crushing a leaf of Strawberry Gum, a type of eucalyptus, the chef encouraged the royal visitors to smell it. \u0027Is that what Koalas eat in the Bush?\u0027 asked the Duke.          Among other plants, Harry bites into some eucalyptus, but not before he had to ask: \u0027Isn\u0027t that what koalas eat?\u0027    Executive Chef Greg Hampton (right) told the royal couple how they provide opportunity to young Aboriginal people  Harry tried plants and was also served Kangaroo and barracuda as a series of Aussie delicacies were prepared and Meghan had a good sniff of some ingredients          The couple departed Government House, visiting an Aboriginal artwork mural on Fitzroy restaurant Charcoal Lane    Prince Harry has cheekily mocked a young girl (pictured) who put a hand on her hips and refused to take a photograph with the royalPrince Harry has cheekily mocked a camera-shy young girl who refused to pose for a photograph with the visiting royal.While thousands of fans have clamoured for a piece of the Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan Markle, this toddler in Dubbo had other ideas.She placed her left hand on her hip and stubbornly refused to move forward and say hello to a bemused prince.He in turn placed his hands on his hips to playfully mimic the young girl before bending down to give her a hug.The girl\u0027s parents were heard in the background giggling at their daughter\u0027s behaviour during the meet-and-greet in Dubbo on Wednesday before pushing her slightly forward to chat to the prince.                                                     But Meghan and Harry appeared completely at ease as they took a tram to the beach with a group of excited schoolchildren.While the journey lasted less than five minutes, the youngsters managed to get in some pressing questions. Ella Burns, a 12-year-old pupil from Albert Park primary school added: \u0027She said that she hadn\u0027t thought of one as it was still quite early.\u0027Meghan was also asked by Ella what she liked doing in her spare time.The Duchess replied that she \u0027didn\u0027t have much spare time\u0027 but when she does, she enjoys \u0027relaxing and watching TV shows.\u0027She faltered when asked what her favourite show was, and replied: \u0027There\u0027s heaps, I can\u0027t think of a specific one.\u0027 Meanwhile Lola Marinis, 12, from Middlepark Primary School, sat near Harry.He asked what job she wanted to do, and she replied that she wanted to be a teacher.Harry told her, \u0027There is always going to be one bad teacher that you remember, we need more good teachers.\u0027The Duchess of Sussex has been given plenty of flowers since she arrived in Australia. But today she was given her first tiara.It was presented by six year old Annie, a pupil at Albert Park primary school in Melbourne.Annie was one of 600 cheering children who greeted the duke and duchess as they came to see how the school is cutting waste and growing vegetables as part of a sustainability programme.Harry spotted Annie, who was holding a bunch of flowers as well as a toy tiara, and knelt down and said: \u0027Lily of the valley - is that right?\u0027Then, gesturing to Meghan, he said: \u0027Are they for her?\u0027The duchess, who was wearing a dress by Club Monaco, came over and said: \u0027Oh my goodness, thank you. Those are amazing!\u0027The couple met the school\u0027s \u0027waste warriors\u0027, dressed up in cape and masks, and met some sustainability leaders who showed them their \u0027nude food\u0027 lunch boxes, without any plastic wrapping.At the school wormery the duke was invited to name their pet snail. \u0027Speedy?\u0027 he suggested.At the vegetable patch, which included marigolds, peas, lettuce and alfalfa, Emma Cafferkey and Finn McClenaghan, both 12, showed them how to mulch. \u0027The mulch is made out of sugar that has been shredded. You have to remember with the mulch not to put it on top of the plants.\u0027After they left he said: \u0027They said we were very well educated and that we knew a lot about this kind of stuff.\u0027As they left, one little boy told Harry: \u0027You remind me of my uncle.\u0027The duke replied: \u0027Is that a good thing? Is it because I\u0027ve got a ginger beard?\u0027           Meghan and Harru spent time in the gardens of Govrenment House today where they met dignitaries and even an Aussie Rules star          The the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are a tactile couple and were often seen holding hands or giving eachothr a supportive rub this time at the Royal Botanic Gardens  Harry and Meghan having fun as they visit projects that align with their goals on the tour including encouraging women to take part in sport          The Duchess concentrated as she passes an Australian Rules football during an event at Government House          Meghan has said she is \u0027tired\u0027 but having a fantastic time on their 16-day tour with 76 different functions in four different countriesFoodie Meghan was in her element as she and Harry enjoyed a taste of Australia at Charcoal Lane, a social enterprise restaurant in Melbourne\u0027s trendy Fitzroy suburb.At a private lunch, the royal couple enjoyed a shared entree of mushroom and quinoa nest and chargrilled kangaroo and main courses of wild boar, saffron risotto and barramundi.          Meghan laughed a great deal during a reception where they met young ambassadors in Victoria and played games with themIt was prepared by young chefs being trained by the Mission Australia programme, which assists young indigenous Australians into employment, in many cases giving them a fresh start in life.Before the meal, they visited the kitchen, where Executive Chef Greg Hampton told the Duke and Duchess: \u0027Welcome, we are so happy to have you here.\u0027Gesturing at the sparkling surfaces, Harry said: \u0027You\u0027ve got a very clean kitchen – is it always this clean? Especially clean today?\u0027Meghan slipped off her Martin Grant trench coat in the warm room before Greg talked the couple through an array of unusual herbs and aromatic spices, getting them to smell and taste them.\u0027A lot of these ingredients have been here for thousands of years. Our fruits are the same as fruits thousands of years ago,\u0027 he explained.Showing them a finger lime, he squeezed out the fleshy contents, explaining: \u0027It comes out like caviar.\u0027\u0027Oh my goodness, that\u0027s incredible,\u0027 said the Duchess.But he warned the couple that the Tasmanian Pepper came with a kick, adding: \u0027I don\u0027t want to freak you out!\u0027Speaking ahead of their arrival, he had said: \u0027I would hesitate to offer her (the pregnant Duchess) the pepper, because they are quite hot.\u0027The first time I tasted one I thought I was having an allergic reaction because the heat creeps up on you. I don\u0027t want to freak her out.\u0027Crushing a leaf of Strawberry Gum, a type of Eucalyptus, he encouraged the royal visitors to smell it.\u0027Is that what Koalas eat in the Bush?\u0027 asked the Duke.\u0027Yes, but we can\u0027t eat it in the same way,\u0027 replied Greg, explaining how oils from the plant are used to flavour marinades, fish dishes and even ice cream.The couple were presented with Charcoal Lane aprons for the \u0027touch, taste and smell\u0027 experience, but did not wear them.Speaking ahead of the royal visit, Greg said: \u0027We are here to support young Aboriginal people into the workforce, with a view that when they leave this place, there is going to be long-term employment for them,\u0027 he said.\u0027I\u0027m not going to turn everyone that comes here into a chef, but if they leave here with a work ethic, it\u0027s a win for us.\u0027           Governor of Victoria Linda Dessau and her husband Anthony Howard at a reception given by the Governor of Victoria, at Government House during their visit to Melbourne          The expressive couple smile and laughed throughout the day today as they were mobbed by supporters wishing them well          The crowd of about 5,000 showed no sign of dampening their enthusiasm for the pair, despite being slightly behind schedule          Thousands of royal fans gathered at the Royal Botanic Gardens to take photos and meet the royal couple as they arrived          Harry tenderly holds his wife\u0027s hand behind his back as they enter Government House in Melbourne today    Harry and Meghan went Government House, where they were greeted by Governor Linda Dessau          At a private lunch, the royal couple enjoyed a shared entree of mushroom and quinoa nest and chargrilled kangaroo and main courses of wild boar, saffron risotto and barramundi          Meghan looks adoringly at her husband at a reception held in their honour today as their tour hit day 3           The Duke and Duchess of Sussex raced model Formula 1 cars inside Government House, meeting with young leaders          Duchess Meghan was seen patting a guide dog in the reception of Government HouseCharcoal Lane currently employs 23 young people for 15 hours a week as they work towards a Certificate 2 in hospitality.\u0027A lot of them come from backgrounds where nobody has worked, so this is very important for them,\u0027 said Greg.Programme Manager Troy Crellin said that in 10 years, the organisation had helped some 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders into work.The Duke and Duchess\u0027s visit to the restaurant began after they admired a mural outside created by Gunnai and Waradgerie man Robert Young to honour the building and the area\u0027s indigenous heritage.He told Harry and Meghan how his Celebration Dreaming artwork references Aboriginal identity, connections and culture in inner Melbourne Fitzroy.Before heading into the kitchen, they received a Welcome to Country delivered by Wurundjeri Elder Uncle Colin Hunter.Mission Australia CEO, James Toomey said: \u0027It was such a fantastic and humbling surprise to hear that Mission Australia\u0027s restaurant, Charcoal Lane was chosen to welcome The Duke and Duchess for a tour, hands-on cooking session and lunch.

She did a handball. That\u0027s a pretty incredible thing for anybody to do.\u0027She had not seen an AFL football before Howard, the governor\u0027s husband, explained to her what it was like - the weight of it is a little bit different, and that you handball it, you don\u0027t pass it.\u0027Sabrin Nyawela, 20, a student teacher and This Girl Can ambassador originally from South Sudan, also spoke to the duchess.\u0027She was talking about how she loved the whole vibe of This Girl Can. She enjoyed being around women who want to make a change.\u0027She described her as a \u0027role model\u0027 and added: \u0027She was really engaged.

The right soundtrack has the power to transform even a burger and chips into a fine-dining experience, at least according to research by Cornell University. Why? Because the music makes us eat more mindfully and even perceive our food more favourably.“Dinner parties are essentially about communication and the mingling of several different conversations, so you want background music that’s sophisticated enough to spark conversation, then melt away rather than competing with your chat,” says composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty recently topped the iTunes classical charts. So what music works best with different dishes? We spoke to a range of experts – from restaurateurs to party planners and composers to find out.Soundtrack for starters“I put as much thought and care into the music I play at a dinner party as I do into my cooking,” says restaurateur Asma Khan of the Darjeeling Express in Soho, London.Her favourite starter is a mutton shikampuri kebab, a recipe from the Royal Kitchens of Hyderabad. “It has a uniquely layered shah-jeera flavour,” she says. “You think it’s mild at first, then the cardamom and cumin spice blend hits you. Most people don’t recognise all the flavours, but this starter never fails to impress.”While guests dig in, Khan plays the classical Indian Sufi song Maula-e-Kull, sung by Abdida Parveen. “It has a very deep rhythm,” she says. “You don’t need to understand the words to feel the emotion in the voice of the singer: it starts off with the love between two people, then becomes deeply complex. Both the song and the starter have this incredible hidden layering, and together they set a rich, serene tone for your evening.”Your musical main“The right music helps the conversation flow, which is particularly important when your guests are meeting for the first time,” says Alice Matthews, founder of MotherHustler supper clubs.“I love the classical guitar interpretation of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Air on a G String, by Richard Mollenbeck,” she says. Like the vegetarian tagine she serves her guests, the music is about different interpretations of a classic, melodiously coming together to create something new. “I’ve discovered guests relax and enjoy themselves more when eating familiar food and listening to familiar music, but in a heightened, luxurious atmosphere,” she says.Sweet symphony“I love to cook with seasonal, locally sourced ingredients, and my taste in music reflects that too,” says Henrietta Inman, author of The Natural Baker: A new way to bake using the best natural ingredients.“For a dinner party I’ll make my plum, blackberry and blueberry crumble, served with a rosemary and lemon syrup. The topping is crunchy and decadent, made with wholegrain spelt, oats and almonds.” And the perfect accompaniment? The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, says Inman.“It’s a beautifully tranquil piece by an English composer and it brings to mind a dusky evening eating outdoors, with birds singing in the hedgerows and trees hanging heavy with ripe fruit,” she says.The tune for cheese“The cheese course comes at a perfect moment to steer conversation into another direction,” says La Fromagerie’s Patricia Michelson, author of Cheese.She recommends presenting a five-strong board with Sinodun Hill, a nutty goat’s cheese the creamy, sweet and aromatic Beaufort Chalet D’Alpage Lincolnshire Poacher Double Barrel, a hard cheese with a distinctive savoury acidity from the chalky soil where the cattle graze a decadent Brie aux Truffes and Regalis, a ewe’s milk blue that combines sharp mineral qualities with a rich, floral taste.On the playlist is a classical composition with a jazz vibe, such as the Jacques Loussier Trio playing Bach. “It’s reflective and stimulating but soft and flowing, and these are words I often use when describing cheese too,” says Michelson.The finale Just as a digestif serves to calm the mood at the end of the meal, music plays a similar role. “One of the wonderful things about music is it fills in any awkward silence at the end of your dinner party, when everyone’s said an awful lot,” says Davis.“I love an Amaretto, but I wouldn’t be as didactic as to suggest that a sweet liqueur goes with sweet music,” he says. “Go for something cosy that welcomes guests into your own personal comfort zone.”For that, try downloading Rêverie Nocturne by Giulio Regondi or Liberty by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing.

Andrew Dickens investigates the nascent field of ‘gastrophysics’The relationship between music and food is much like any other great bond: partners, best friends, loving siblings – you just can’t imagine them not being together. Whether at restaurants, weddings, festivals, or a picnic blanket at Proms in the Park, they’re almost inseparable.But what sparked this passionate affair? It’s not like the first humans were chewing on a woolly mammoth when they decided that what the meal really needed was a conch concerto in the background – food was functional, music was non-existent. Then along came civilisation (jumping a few millennia of cultural evolution) and the romance began. And like many a good romance, it began with a party.“Music and food have always gone hand in hand,” says singer, songwriter and broadcaster Cerys Matthews, whose boutique festival, the Good Life Experience, gives equal weight to both. “Were feasts ever silent? No. Whether the Romans, or the bards of Wales, music was always present.“If the music is wrong, it negates everything, but when it’s right – bingo,” she says. “I remember, as a child, looking forward to going to my favourite Indian restaurant in Swansea. The food, the Bengali music, it all helped escape the humdrum.”Both music and food were important parts of ancient civilisation, the Romans in particular being keen foodies. Music would be played at all sorts of public and private gatherings, and those events – such as funerals, the theatre and festivals celebrating the gods – would frequently involve eating.Centuries later, the synthesis of music and food that remains with us to this day would come into being in the baroque and subsequent periods of classical music – not only were royal banqueting halls filled with waltzes, concertos and chamber pieces (some of which would have been the pop hits of the day), but food actually inspired the composers who wrote them. Famed caffeine addict Bach wrote his Coffee Cantana, Debussy wrote La Puerta del Vino, inspired by the wine gate at the Alhambra palace in Granada, while in Carl Orff’s Olim Lacus Coluera, from Carmina Burana, a swan sings from a roasting spit.But perhaps the most significant development would be the arrival, in the 18th century, of the modern restaurant – the kind of place we would recognise by contemporary standards, complete with waiters, set tables and … music. There are few places now where you can dine in public without a backing track. It’s a matter of some debate.“In a lot of the very high-end restaurants you rarely get music,” says the food critic and editor of Waitrose food William Sitwell. “The only noise is the chef. Other than that it’s complete silence.“But music when eating can create atmosphere – if it’s done right,” he says. “It needs to be done with subtlety. Great chefs are masters of many things, from decor to music. If your only gift is to cook supremely, you won’t get far.”Matthews agrees. “Music accentuates a meal, but getting that music right is an art,” she says. “If you’re in a big industrial restaurant, you can’t have tinny digital files playing. And you need old material speakers so that the music gets into your body. You can’t underestimate the power of sound. It affects our emotions.”It’s been shown that people are more likely to enjoy a meal if they like the tunes playing as they eat. The same goes when the cultural provenance of the food and music are matched, as Matthews alluded to when reminiscing about the Indian meals of her childhood. Thai music enhances the joy of Thai food panpipes pep up Peruvian, and so on. The effects go beyond that, though. Manipulation is a strong word, so let’s say music can be used to give our decision-making a little nudge.“If music is played too loud it actually suppresses our ability to taste,” says Prof Charles Spence of the University of Oxford, a psychologist and author of Gastrophysics: The New Science of Eating. “But if it’s played at a pleasant level, our association with that music can carry over. For example, if classical music is played, people spend more. If French music is played in a supermarket, they’re more likely to buy French wine.“The loudness and tempo, or beats per minute affect how we eat,” adds Spence. “As they go up, we tend to eat or drink to the beat. Some restaurants use fast music to get people out of the door quickly and slow it down if they want customers to linger. We’re pulled in certain directions by music.”And it’s not just how we eat that’s swayed by music, but also how we cook.“Music when I cook is therapeutic,” says Sitwell. “It can be anything from Mozart to NWA. I’d find it very strange to cook without it. Among professional chefs, again it’s a contentious issue – some think music is a distraction, while others insist, even thrive on it.”Anthony Bourdain’s eclectic Music to Cook By playlist is a huge hit on Spotify, while examples of music-loving chefs include René Redzepi of Noma, who asked Metallica’s Lars Ulrich to write the foreword to one of his books, and Jamie Oliver, who told us that Westlife are just perfect for preparing salmon.“Cooking without music is bland,” says Ben Lebus, founder of Mob Kitchen, whose connection with music is so close that their upcoming eponymous debut book comes with codes for carefully curated cooking playlists. “It’s like cooking without salt,” he says. “Cooking has a rhythm, like music. You can dance around. I like upbeat tunes. Rossini’s Thieving Magpie is a big favourite at the moment. Coldplay just ruins food.“I think my dream combination would be cooking spaghetti puttanesca to Van Morrison’s Cleaning Windows. That would take me back to being 12 and the happiest times I had with my parents.”So, music can be used to influence both our choices of what and how we eat. It can affect the way we cook. It stirs up emotions and triggers associations, and can just as easily ruin a meal. But we’re beginning to learn that music is more than just a mood-setter, even more than a psychological tool that can get us to shimmy our finger a few more rungs down the wine list: it can actually affect the way we taste food. It’s an ingredient.“I call it sonic seasoning,” says Spence, who has led the research into this phenomenon. “You can pick or make music because its sonic qualities seem to make flavour. A higher pitch might make sweet or sour flavours, while lower notes can produce bitter flavours. You can create musical menus: creamy music, umami music.”Is this innate or learned?“It’s not been fully tested, but it appears to be cross-cultural,” says Spence. “One suggestion is that we have some innate sense that’s been useless until now. We naturally correlate colour and taste, for example, so that green in fruit tends to mean bitter and unripe, so maybe we do the same with sound.“Another theory is to do with the noises we make when we’re babies. Across all species of mammal, newborns make the same oral and facial gestures when they taste things. For example, the tongue will stick out when we taste something sour, so perhaps the gurgles and utterances we make when our tongue is in that position stay with us.”Could it be that all of those high-end, music-free establishments are missing a trick?“Quite possibly. You do get places that are a throwback to the Michelin-starred restaurants of the past – silent temples where the food will speak for itself. Wiley restaurateurs and businesspeople know the value of music. I think it was the founders of the Hard Rock Cafe who said: ‘We play music because it makes people spend more.’”These hypothesis are being put to the test by one chef in particular: Jozef Youssef, founder of Kitchen Theory, which describes itself as an experimental gastronomy design studio. He works closely with Spence in a field they have dubbed “gastrophysics” – an investigation of how our senses affect the way we taste.Youssef’s Chef’s Table events have become one of the UK’s – if not the world’s – most exciting culinary experiences. They are multi-sensory, placing emphasis on texture, smells, visual stimulation, and very much on sound.“For years, a lot was taken for granted with taste,” he says. “Sound was overlooked when it came to flavour perception. The music was tied to emotions, to nostalgia. It was used to set a tone, such as Indian music in Indian restaurants. It still is. Here we create playlists that actually enhance the flavour of the food. It can even work the other way round. For a synaesthesia event we did, we listened over and over to one piece of music until we had inspiration for a dish. Every moment of our Chef’s Table experiences, from when you walk in for cocktails, to when you’re relaxing after the meal, is carefully influenced by music.“If people are sceptical, they should sit and relax with a glass of their favourite whisky, then play different types of music while they enjoy it,” says Youssef. “They’ll notice different characteristics being brought out by the sounds. The access we have to music now, through radio stations and streaming, means it’s easy to experiment.”There is, of course, a balance to be struck: a fine line between enhancing and getting in the way. “The keyword is congruency,” says Steve Keller, chief executive of audio branding company iV. “It’s about aligning the senses.”Keller comes at it from the other side to Youssef. With a background in psychology, followed by 30 years working in the Nashville music business, he now combines these two worlds, treading the ground between science and art to use sound to influence our behaviour and perceptions.He says that his aim is to “hack our perceptions”, and acknowledges fully that the mere mention of the word “hack” probably has you checking your bank statement. But he firmly believes that the clever use of music to influence the way we taste can have huge benefits now and in the future.“Throughout history, music has been part of the ritual of eating,” he says. “But we had no understanding of its influence. Through being intentional, music can improve a meal. It’s about how you use it. You know the ingredients for a cake, but it’s how you bake it that affects the flavour. The music has to sound good – it can’t be a cacophony. It’s not magic, either. You can’t make something spicy with sound, but ‘spicy’ music enhances spicy flavours.”For Keller, it’s not all about adding sonic seasoning to fancy meals. He sees a broader use for the science: one that could have a profound impact on lives.“If we dream about the future, we can imagine how you get home to your smart refrigerator and you ask it to look at its contents and provide you with a recipe for those ingredients. Then you instruct your speaker: ‘Hey, I need music to enhance pasta primavera.’ But what I’m really interested in is how this could be used in healthcare. For example, cancer and its treatment can change or diminish our sense of taste. Could music improve patients’ eating experiences? Could a soundtrack add sweetness for people with diabetes?”It seems the already intimate relationship between music and food is only going to get closer as our access to music continues to increase and artificial intelligence helps machines to crunch the numbers for crunchy sounds. And let’s not forget the wonderful possibility that our fridge and speaker could team up to provide the perfect evening in. Yet technology can only do so much and go so far. Deep down, the connection between us, food and music runs deeper.“So much has been marketed to keep products distant, to be desired from afar,” says Matthews. “But I think people are moving away from things such as celebrity DJs and just want to watch players play. The idea of our festival is to go out, enjoy music and eat good food. It’s all about doing the simple things.”And Keller agrees: “The future is more dynamic than static,” he says. “I would like to think as humans we crave these sensory experiences. It’s why people still enjoy music on vinyl – they can touch and smell it. Fads will come and go, but at the end of the day we will always be drawn to how we experience the world with our senses.”Quite so. Which is why we should celebrate the wonderful marriage of taste and sound why we should, with apologies to Shakespeare, for the love of food and music, play on.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing.

Poetry’s ability to engage with language when it is being so debased, when there are so many lies and so much fake news, its ability to look at the discourses around us, is so important.” She is joined on the judging panel by fellow poets Sinéad Morrissey and Daljit Nagra.Hayes, who wrote a poem a day in the opening stretch of Trump’s presidency, said his sonnets were “a response to what it means to be a writer, an African American, a man, an American”.He added: “It was the only way for me to process the quickness of the turnover of the media cycle that Trump has created – every day there is a new bone in the pot, so to speak. To cope with that I decided not to linger, so whatever happened on Monday I couldn’t be revising on Tuesday or Wednesday, because there would be another new shock to respond to. I don’t think of them as perfect sonnets by any measure, they’re almost a record of what was happening. I was putting in about 12 hours a day on them, working sunup to sunrise.”Five first collections also made the cut, selected from a record 176 submissions, in what Pollard said was an astonishing year for debuts.Zaffar Kunial, who was born in Birmingham to an English mother and a Kashmiri father, takes on topics including the different worlds his parents come from in his debut, Us. “My mum is white and English and was a schoolteacher. She could quote Shakespeare,” he said. “My dad wasn’t educated beyond the age of seven, his school was bombed by the British during the war of independence. There were all sorts of differences between them, and that’s one kind of ‘us’ I look at.”Kunial himself never studied literature, only reading his first novel, Hanif Kureishi’s The Buddha of Suburbia, at the age of 19. “I actually quote the first line: ‘My name is Karim Amir, and I am an Englishman born and bred, almost.’ I say in the book that English literature had me at ‘almost’,” he said. “I didn’t think literature was really for me until then.”Kunial did not study writing either, although he worked as a creative writer for five years at Hallmark Cards. “I was mainly rhyming ‘do  to  you’ and ‘way  day  say’, but it gave me a hunger for language that was about real things such as love and death and parents, but that wasn’t doggerel,” he said, adding that the way he writes now couldn’t be more different.Fiona Moore’s first collection, The Distal Point, opens with a series of elegies for her late partner, who died 11 years ago. Moore left her career in the Foreign Office to write poetry because, she said, of a question he had asked her. “I’d always written a bit of poetry,” Moore explained, “but I was writing about one poem every three years. Then I had a road to Damascus moment.” On a walk in Suffolk one evening, they got lost, and she was complaining about work. “He turned to me and said: ‘What will you regret not having done when you’re 60?’ And the answer came out: ‘Writing poetry.’” On the Monday, she asked for a sabbatical from her job, and then took voluntary redundancy. “The shortlisting is a validation, by three writers whose work I admire,” she said.Also in the running for the award, which has been won in the past by poets including Ted Hughes, Alice Oswald and Carol Ann Duffy, are Ailbhe Darcy, Phoebe Power, Richard Scott and Hannah Sullivan. “Together they offer an invigorated language, confident mastery of form, and fresh, sophisticated perspectives on our uncertain times,” said Morrissey. The winner will be announced on 14 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f86c373de8f1d943e936a8c727c1392c55f93b5d/0_2533_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb0cbe2536113f66e262a0334eb9acf9","title":"boxes within boxes share your examples of excessive packaging","story":"We would like your help investigating egregious examples of excessive packaging With some companies ditching plastic straws, a movement to get people reusing coffee cups and of course a UK plastic bag levy, some may think progress is being made despite dire warnings about the environment  this month.Among a litany of reasons that there is a long way to go, excessive packaging remains a worry for many consumers and environmentalists.We have heard from several readers sharing their concerns about extreme packaging and have previously published some of their stories.

A proud community, where an honest day’s work could earn you a decent day’s pay. Years of austerity have ripped the heart out of this place. But that’s just part of the story. This has been decades in the making. We lost the factories, we lost the jobs, we lost confidence in our community. We lost control.”So runs the introduction to a short film titled Our Town, shot in places such as Mansfield and Hastings (and, somewhat confusingly, the cities of Liverpool and Glasgow) and released three weeks ago by the Labour party. In terms of political strategy, it is a clear attempt to push Labour’s message into places where it has been underperforming, and address its supposed “towns problem” (more of which in a moment). Viewed from another perspective, its three and a half minutes are a brisk and very powerful tour through the three-decade failure of what some people call neoliberalism. More than anything, it vividly evokes one of modern Britain’s starkest cultural ides: the one that separates our bigger, most successful cities from hundreds of comparatively disadvantaged towns, and which exploded so spectacularly in the vote on whether or not Britain should leave the EU.This much we know: across the world, cities are growing at speed, powered by the tendency of modern economies to build themselves around clusters of educated people, and the so-called agglomeration effects whereby cutting-edge businesses are attracted to places where networking and collaboration happens as a matter of course. This leaves towns in a very uncertain position, and the resulting frustrations and resentments have obvious political manifestations: Trump v Clinton, leave v remain, and the sense that mainland Europe is now cleaved by a battle between metropolitan liberals and populists who draw their support from well beyond the city walls.Since 2010, as we have travelled around the country making films for the ’s Anywhere but Westminster series, towns and their sense of distance from power and influence have been a key subject we have returned to time and again. Indeed, we have often understood the watershed political stories of the past few years in terms of particular places. For us, the rise of Ukip was synonymous with Clacton in Essex. We watched the story of the Scottish independence referendum of 2014 unfold from the vantage point of Falkirk, population 35,000. Two years later, we came to associate the phenomenon of working-class support for Brexit with the post-industrial Welsh town of Merthyr Tydfil. Moreover, one of the other things highlighted by the Labour film has become more and more clear: such places are now at the centre of British political conversation.We both grew up in towns, and regularly talk about an unshakeable affinity with their rituals and everyday rhythms: market days, the massed Saturday rush to the supermarket, the daily sense of things beginning to slowly wind down at 4pm every day. And we’ve recently spent sufficiently long spells hanging around in ring-road pubs and high-street coffee outlets to come up with a series of conclusions about towns, where they are headed and what it all means for the future of the country. As follows:The night’s big story, however, was Labour’s national surge. Sent into a spin by the shock national exit poll, we drove 11 miles down the M6 to central Birmingham, where we found a completely different political reality. Most of the people we met were under 30, and they had voted Labour in their droves. Their opinions about immigration, Brexit and the future of the country were often the polar opposite of what we had heard in Walsall. It was an amazing thing to see, but in the flurry of coverage of Labour’s achievements, one thing was rather forgotten: the switch from Labour to the Tories in Walsall North had been replicated in such constituencies as the former mining town of Mansfield, Stoke-on-Trent South, North East Derbyshire, and Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland – and, indeed, the 120-odd seats where there had been a swing from Labour to the Tories.Before Corbynmania, there was Milifandom. On a platform of higher taxes for big earners, tackling the energy giants, and talking in general about the shortcomings of 21st-century capitalism, Ed Miliband had apparently arrived at a strong position in the polls. Much of left-wing Britain and the liberal chatterati, informed largely by their social media bubbles and errors in polling, thought in 2015 that he would be prime minister. But when we pitched up in the highly marginal Midlands constituency of Nuneaton, in among a very familiar townscape that included a still-busy street market and apparently thriving retail parks, we found no evidence of what such excitement was ostensibly all about. Sure enough, the Tories retained Nuneaton with an increased majority – and in 2017, even though Labour’s support went up, the Conservatives also put on votes, and Nuneaton stayed blue.This is one example among many of a story that now sits at the heart of Britain’s political future – and as Nuneaton proves, it goes beyond ideas of “left behind” communities and places that have become byword for hardship. Whatever their economic position, there is something about towns – in England in particular – that often makes them difficult territory for the modern left, which sometimes looks in danger of piling on support in urban areas where left-liberal values are a given while it retreats from less populous places whose collective politics represent much more of a challenge. This is the crux of what has come to be known as Labour’s “towns problem”. Of the 64 seats the party now needs to win a parliamentary majority of one, 31 are essentially town constituencies among its top 100 targets, the figure is 49.Labour’s film is a powerful evocation of a long history of political and economic failure. But in its unendingly bleak picture – crystallised in the claim that “years of austerity have ripped the heart out of this place” – it is arguably guilty of one of the things that sits at the heart of too many portraits of towns: the idea that the most disadvantaged places are not only devoid of hope, but of people and organisations making a real difference to everyday life.Neither is true, as has been proved by pretty much every town we have spent time in over the last decade – and, indeed, our own mistakes. These are easy to make, because the most visually striking aspects of some places – the boarded-up shops, empty streets and uncollected rubbish – are what you tend to see first, and stories are easily told in terms of extremes. But places are always much more complicated than they might first appear – and besides, people are hardly going to react well to being told by outsiders that where they are living is hopeless.On one particularly memorable occasion, we made a video in Stoke-on-Trent – the city made up of the six towns of Stoke, Hanley, Burslem, Longton, Fenton and Tunstall – that overemphasised its bleaker aspects and attracted the anger and frustration of a lot of local people. So we went back there, and found enough of what academics call “social capital” to fill an eight-part series of videos: a thriving milieu of young entrepreneurs and artists and a DIY spirit among community groups working to improve their areas without help from outside. The Portland Inn project, for example, has used the Community Asset Transfer process to take over a closed-down pub at the heart of an estate and reopen it as a community centre. Then there is the community group Our Burslem, which revived festivals and is campaigning to bring a street market back to what locals call “the Mother Town” – in the face of the fact that Burslem is usually portrayed in the media as a ghost town.What this highlights is not just about the media and its blind spots. It also shines light on the political left’s ingrained habit of thinking that lasting change is best brought to places via the distant central state. In an age when people are networked together and towns and cities teem with grassroots initiatives, that model will no longer work.Eight long years ago, just as Ed Miliband became Labour leader, we spent time in Altrincham, an outwardly affluent market town on the southern edge of Greater Manchester. It had been laid low by the opening of the massive Trafford Centre retail destination and a huge new Tesco, and local people talked in emotional terms about the awful decline of the town centre, not just the number of empty shops, but the loss of something even more precious. “There is something missing in Altrincham,” one woman told us. “It’s a miserable place to come to. Most people I know are reasonably well off, but there isn’t the community we had 20 or 30 years ago.”The town has since been revived partly via an array of independent food shops and “artisan” businesses, a transformation that has been accompanied by remarkable political changes: it was once a rock-solid Tory heartland, but two of its borough councillors are now from the Green party. The moral of the story is pretty clear: once a town’s high street falls into decay, resentments and frustrations are sown that can eventually have serious political consequences.Everywhere we go, people talk about the fate of their town centres with amazing passion, and frustration. Obviously, the Altrincham model of regeneration will not suit everywhere, to say the least. Labour now has a five-point plan for high streets that takes in an end to ATM charges, free wifi, a new register of empty properties, free bus travel for under-25s and reform of business rates. It sounds promising, though perhaps evades something that is glaringly obvious: conventional chain-store retailing is dying fast and high streets need to find new uses. Until this sinks in, the mood of resentment and political disconnection that characterises many of our towns will fester on.With good reason, the political debate about austerity tends to focus on cuts to such crucial services as adult and children’s social care, education, libraries and public transport. But there is also an overlooked ambient austerity manifested in streets festooned with rubbish and the decline and decay of public space – and it has a huge effect on how people feel about where they live and what politics has to offer them.Last year we made one of our general election films in Lancashire. We followed a Labour council candidate called Lisa Bloor around her hometown of Haslingden, a former mill town with a population of 18,000. She has direct experience of cuts because of her father, who has Parkinson’s disease – but one of her most affecting illustrations of what austerity had done to where she lives came when she took us to a local park whose most obvious features were flaking paint, rusty swings and an inescapable sense of neglect. “These might seem like little things that don’t matter to a lot of people, nationally – but to communities like this, this park is everything,” she said.After eight years of cuts, many people we meet have fatalistically talked about austerity as being like the weather, but others have proved that the degradation of the public realm has already fed into the vote for Brexit and support for Corbyn’s new Labour party. In towns, austerity fuses with all those boarded-up shops to confirm people’s sense that they are still being ignored. This feels like an issue that is slowly turning critical, which is what lies behind the prime minister’s recent promise that austerity is over, and why she will be in hot water if – as seems likely – it actually carries on.In 2013 Margaret Thatcher died, and Anywhere but Westminster embarked on an Iron Lady-themed road trip. We started in one of the biggest towns in post-industrial south Wales: Merthyr Tydfil. Outside a huge Tesco Extra, two men in their 50s told us they still talked about the 1980s miners’ strike every day. On the high street, however, we stopped a 19-year-old woman about to start college and asked her if she knew what a trade union was. “No,” she replied. “What’s that?”This is one example of the radically different views of politics that sometimes feel like they cut towns in clean in half. Another is centred on some of the things that sit at the heart of the debate about Brexit, and the fact that even in supposedly hardcore leave-supporting towns, there are fascinating isions in how people think about the tangle of issues that came to a head around the 2016 referendum.Obviously, young people who are not happy in towns tend to leave. It is the older generations who stick around, and who feel the changes to town life more deeply. Despite the fashionable idea that Britain’s current malaise will be miraculously ended once they begin to die off, they are going to be around for some time to come.Rugeley is a one-time mining centre in Staffordshire that sits in the shadow of a disused power station. It is now the home of a jaw-droppingly huge Amazon fulfilment centre – so big that in a car travelling at 30 mph, it takes almost a minute to get from one end to the other.Just over a month ago, we went there to watch the GMB union trying to increase the takeup of union membership. The workers came in on foot, in shared cars, and in large buses from nearby towns such as Walsall and Wolverhampton. Most of them ignored the campaigners trying to hand them leaflets, and the atmosphere at the gates had an uneasy, brittle aspect. The distribution centre sits next to a Premier Inn and a branch of McDonald’s: thanks also to the endless roar of huge Amazon lorries, it is one of the most quintessentially modern places we have ever visited.People in places like Rugeley are often called “the left behind”. For sure, the industries that once dominated where they live have all gone. But many of these towns have been thrust to the cutting edge of a new economy of distribution centres, retail and hospitality, and logistics hubs, run using state-of-the-art technology. In that sense such towns point to where we are all going next, not least in terms of an automated future that most politicians have barely started to think about.The Somerset town of Frome is 14 miles from Bath and has a population of around 25,000, split between relatively recent incomers attracted to its newly fashionable reputation and people whose backgrounds reach back into the town’s industrial past and its recent experience of neglect and hardship.Frome has pioneered a new idea known as “flatpack democracy”, centred on the town and parish councils that form the English system of government’s lowest tier. We explored it two years ago.The idea has two key elements. First, it aims at running as many local amenities and services as possible from the absolute grassroots. Second, and equally important, it is about opening up decision-making to the maximum level of local participation. As the idea’s inventor, Frome councillor Peter Macfadyen, puts it: “There are other town councils where the clerk walks in first, and the members stand, the mayor comes in behind, and they then say a prayer. The public have to write in beforehand, saying they want to speak. And it’s all just lost in some sort of Victorian past. It’s just insane.”The idea of flatpack democracy, or something very like it, has been adopted in towns and villages in Bedfordshire, Devon and Cheshire. In the small northern city of Preston, an energetic Labour council is blazing a trail for something comparable but even more ambitious: the so-called Preston model of local government, whereby as much council spending as possible is aimed at boosting the local economy. Since the Brexit referendum, we have regularly wondered whether these ideas could be tried in the kind of towns whose experiences of deindustrialisation, political neglect and latter-day austerity have all highlighted the extent to which one their biggest issues is power, and the lack of it.Wherever we go, with good reason, most people we meet have no sense of which bit of government is responsible for this or that aspect of their lives – only that the forces making the decisions are remote, seemingly unaccountable and rarely interested in where they live. Many urban areas have been recently boosted by the creation of “city regions” governed by “metro mayors” in Scotland and Wales, devolution has brought power closer to people’s lives. In most English towns, by contrast, systems of power and accountability are pretty much as they were 40 years ago.What this does to people’s connection with politics is clear. To quote a report by the recently founded thinktank the Centre for Towns, “on average, people living in cities are much less likely to believe that politicians don’t care about their area. Those living in towns are, in contrast, more likely to think politicians don’t care about their area – and won’t in the future.”There lies the biggest issue of all. The future of our towns will only partly be decided by the high-octane rituals of Westminster debate, and general elections. What really matters is whether they might finally run a much greater share of their own affairs – and, to coin a memorable slogan, take back control.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f07e77acd59ea175b71ce4dc6da1fcbcc245a623/0_220_3144_1887/master/3144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bceafa4cc3fc0ac1cda5a0113e021a61","title":"populism european politics right left bavaria","story":"Don’t be distracted by ‘earthquakes’ in recent elections. Swings to the far right or left are only one part of the bigger pictureWhile there are important local particularities to the Bavarian elections, most notably the end of the last democratic one-party system in Europe, the results reflect a broader European pattern of fragmentation and volatility that is often missed by the obsessive focus on the “rise of populism” narrative.Does this mean little changed? Far from it. First of all, both “blocs” have shifted ideologically, with the right becoming more radical right and the left becoming more left. We have seen this across (western) Europe, with not just radical right parties gaining, but also mainstream parties moving further to the right. Similarly, in many countries, including Belgium and the Netherlands, we see social democratic parties lose (big) and Green parties, and sometimes the radical left, win (big). In these cases, the bloc moves (somewhat) to the left.Second, the party system, including the left and right blocs, has become more fragmented. Not only in terms of the number of parties that gain entry into the parliament, but particularly in terms of their relative size. Few party systems still have one, let alone two, parties that gain more than a third of the vote. Most parties today are medium-sized, which means the blocs no longer consist of a big social democratic party and a small Green party, but two near equal-sized parties. This changes the power dynamics both between and within the blocs.Third, inidual volatility is much higher than aggregate volatility, and it doesn’t take place simply within the blocs either. For example, the CSU lost almost as many voters to the AfD as to the Greens, while the SPD lost almost as many voters to the right-wing parties (CSU and AfD) as to the Greens. Similarly, in the most recent Swedish elections, which saw relatively modest changes in party success, and virtually none in terms of blocs, a record number of voters switched party.Which leads us to the real story of the Bavarian elections, and of most recent elections on the continent. While it is true that populist parties, and more specifically populist radical right parties, have been on the rise in the 21st century, this is only one part of a bigger, and more important story: namely the transformation of European party politics.This transformation affects all parties, not just the populist ones. Centre-left parties are the main losers, greens and radical right parties the main winners, while centre-right parties survive, and sometimes prosper (at least in the short term), by moving sharply right. In addition to the Rechtsruck (political swing to the right), primarily in socio-cultural terms (notably immigration and integration), it has also led to more problematic and prolonged coalition formation processes, from Germany to Sweden, and more vulnerable coalition governments.This transformation of European politics deserves more attention from academics and journalists alike, who too often get distracted by a simplistic “populists versus establishment” frame, and reduce stability and volatility to gains and losses of inidual parties. As Bob Dylan sang more than 50 years ago, “The times they are a changin’” – but this time we need less rigid weathermen to know which way the wind blows."},{"url":null,"title":"samantha bee late night tv republicans","story":"Late-night hosts discussed Trump’s latest comments on climate change and reports of voter suppression before November’s midtermsLate-night hosts took aim at Donald Trump’s most recent claim that he has a “natural instinct for science”, and criticised Republican attempts to suppress voters.On Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, the host included a segment on voter suppression before the November midterms. “The vote hasn’t been this suppressed since Blake Shelton won sexiest man alive,” she joked.Bee spoke about a new ruling that requires voters to have an address that isn’t a PO box, which affects Native Americans living on reservations, before moving on to the hotly contested race in Georgia.Republican Brian Kemp is neck-and-neck with Democrat Stacey Abrams but as Kemp is also secretary of state, he’s been accused of meddling with voter registration to affect the outcome. “File that under ‘how the fuck is that legal?” Bee said.She continued: “He’s like a dog carrying his own leash, if the dog was secretary of state in Georgia.”Kemp claims that, despite reported attempts to suppress voters of colour, people shouldn’t be worried. “Why wouldn’t you trust this civil war statue who wished to be a real boy?” she joked.Bee continued: “Republicans are getting more creative and more shameless about their attempts to block the vote because they know they’re not popular enough to win without cheating. They truly are the Blake Shelton of political parties.”She concluded by stressing the importance of heading out to vote next month. “Voting shouldn’t be a privilege but as long as it is, if you can, you better fucking use it and help other less privileged people do it too,” she said.On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert started with Trump’s recent interview with Associated Press, which saw him ask them what they would do in six years’ time if a “normal” person was in office instead. “I don’t know? Dance in the streets?” Colbert said.Trump also referred to his son Donald Trump Jr as young while defending him over accusations that he met with Russians. “For the record sir, he’s 40,” Colbert countered.When asked about climate change, the president claimed there were scientists on both sides of the argument. “That is true, there are scientists on both sides,” he said. “On one side all the scientists, on the other, one guy who runs a site called realtrueamericanscienceeagle.jesus.”Trump also referenced his uncle who attended MIT, but followed it up by saying he didn’t speak to him about climate change. “Why did you bring in your science uncle if you never talked to him about science?” Colbert asked.He also said that he has a “natural instinct for science” because of his uncle. “You have a natural instinct for science?” Colbert said. “That’s not how knowledge works, you don’t inherit it from your uncle. The most you get from your uncle is your own nose back.”On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also ridiculed Trump for his comments, referring to his belief that an affinity for science was somehow in his blood. “Now, I think that’s cholesterol, but that’s not the point,” he joked.Noah continued: “Just because his uncle was good at science, it doesn’t mean Trump is good at science. That’s not how it works. If a pilot has a heart attack, they’re not like ‘Is anyone on this plane related to a pilot?’”He said that Trump still refuses to believe in climate change for “the dumbest reason possible” before talking about the president’s comments about Saudi Arabia.In another interview, he said that he didn’t want to stir up trouble over the disappearance of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi because of the $110bn deal he has with the Saudis. “Say what you want about Trump but he wears his moral bankruptcy on his sleeve,” he said.He also continued to compare the situation to that of disgraced supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh. “I like how Trump’s way of dealing with a sensitive issue is by bringing in another sensitive issue,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/083c903b5bbea333acbe5181422718c9a615811f/0_842_2585_1550/master/2585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b966f6b3701abdc329133e5c71847cd9","title":"what does a rock look like oxford tests prospective students","story":"Annual release of interview questions comes with suggested ways of answering themHow you listen to music, what a rock looks like, and what historians cannot know about the past are among this year’s list of sample interview questions published by Oxford University.The annual release of interview questions and suggested ways of answering them are designed to prepare aspiring students for the ordeal of trying to get into one of the world’s most elite institutions.Some of the questions are deceptively simple ways of exploring a candidate’s knowledge. Candidates applying for an earth sciences place are shown a rock and asked to explain what it looks like.  Would-be theology students are asked to explain the value of religion whether or not God exists.Other questions are more tricky. Those wanting to study medicine are asked: Is it surprising that viruses cause human diseases? Chemistry candidates are asked to calculate how many different molecules can be made from six carbon atoms and 12 hydrogen atoms.Oxford’s director of admissions, Samina Khan, advises candidates not to be afraid to give plain answers at first. She said: “It is often best to start responding by making very obvious observation and building up discussion from there – solving the problem quickly is less important than showing how you use information and analysis to get there.”She added: “It’s important to remember that most interviews build on material students will have encountered in their studies or touch on areas students mention in their personal statements. Most commonly tutors will provide candidates with material to prompt discussion – for example, a piece of text, an image, or a sample experiment whose results they are asked to consider.”Laura Tunbridge, from St Catherine’s College, explained why a music candidate might be asked to explain the different ways they listen to music. She said: “The question allows students to use their own musical experiences as a starting point for a broader and more abstract discussion about the different ways people consume music, the relationship between music and technology, and how music can define us socially.“I might also expect to discuss whether particular types of music suit being listened to in particular ways whether listening on headphones changes the way you experience what’s going around you and what makes some soundtracks better than others.”Siân Pooley, from Magdalen College, advised history candidates how to explain what they cannot find out about the past. “A candidate might start off by saying that they had been studying Tudor England and historians don’t know much about the lives of the poor because they were less likely to be able to write,” she said.“Given these lower levels of literacy, we could then talk about what sources historians can use to learn about the lives of the majority of the population in 16th-century England. This would require the candidate to think creatively about alternative sources (and their drawbacks), such as, for instance, criminal court records in which people who could not write were required to give oral testimony as witnesses.“They might want to think about how structures of power have altered over time or about how social norms for what can be recorded and kept in archives have changed. This is the sort of conversation that no candidate could predict in advance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c291046f9dd90eba8709d579a59c2bd1876d74f7/93_76_6360_3816/master/6360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b7082afd44080ebb8d2560baeb18151","title":"this is just the beginning freed activists return to fracking site","story":"Trio of activists freed from prison after appeal get hero’s welcome at site of anti-fracking protest On Thursday morning, the day after being released from prison, three environmental activists who became the first people to be jailed for an anti-fracking protest in the UK, returned to the Preston New Road fracking site near Blackpool.Simon Roscoe Blevins, 26, Richard Roberts, 36, and Richard Loizou, 31, arrived to a hero’s welcome from around 40 protesters gathered there. “It’s helped so much while we’ve been in prison to receive all of your letters and to know there is so much support,” Loizou said to the crowd. “We had letters and pictures covering all of our walls, stuck there with toothpaste because that’s all we had,” said Blevins.Blevins, a soil scientist from Sheffield, and Roberts, a piano restorer from London, were sentenced to 16 months in prison, and Loizou, a teacher from Devon, got 15 months last month, after the three were convicted of causing a public nuisance by a jury at Preston crown court.The men were charged for taking part in a direct action protest in July last year in which they climbed onto the cabs of trucks attempting to carry drilling equipment into the Preston New Road site and camped there for three days.The site has been a focal point for protests since October 2016, when the government overturned a decision by Lancashire county council and gave the energy firm Cuadrilla consent to extract shale gas at two wells on the site.The sentences caused outrage among environmental campaigners, human rights groups and politicians. Friends of the Earth and Liberty assisted Kirsty Brimelow QC, the head of the human rights team at Doughty Street Chambers, in appealing against the sentences, warning the case could have a chilling effect on future protests.At around 12.45pm on Wednesday, the high court ruled that the prison terms were “manifestly excessive”. Just over three hours later, the men stepped out into the sunlight from HMP Preston after three weeks inside.He said prison had been different to what he’d expected. “Something that really struck me was that despite there being a really clear hierarchy of power between the people who were locked up and the people who had the keys, between the inmates there was a great deal of equality,” said Blevins.“Regardless of why we were there or our backgrounds or our families, we were all there together.”Asked why he thought they had received such long sentences, Roberts said: “There has been a couple of years of direct action here, with dedicated local campaigners blocking this site and stopping deliveries as much as possible, and they would usually get a fine or a conditional discharge.The men have been released on conditional discharge, so if they reoffend over the next two years they can be re-sentenced for their initial conviction, but all three are determined to continue to help the campaign in ways other than taking part in direct action.“In a lot of ways this whole process has been an amazing learning curve for all of us,” said Blevins. “We know a lot more about the courts and the legal system. We know what we need to do if we want a fair trial and the kind of information that we need to be gathering from the start.”On Monday, Cuadrilla started fracking at the Lancashire site, despite attempts by protesters to blockade the entrance, but, like the others, Loizou is still confident that fracking can be stopped in the UK.“I think this is just the beginning of something really big with regards to resistance to fossil fuels and resistance to injustice,” he said. “I think our imprisonment and Cuadrilla’s actions on Preston New Road have galvanised the environmentalist movement into action.”Roberts agrees. “We learned at school in the 1990s in GCSE geography about the impact that burning fossil fuels would have on the rest of the world and on future generations,” he said. “And it’s been so frustrating to get to 2018 and not see concerted action from government on this.“We’ve pursued democratic means, organised petitions and all of that, for decades, and now it’s only appropriate that we escalate and take direct action to stop the fossil fuel industries. We will continue to take action until we see change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd53bc920642114d6a176261b3869aae61a840b/141_383_2204_3125/master/2204.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8e1b2eb92d8e14f5180a6182bd5079c8 1760w","title":"from satay skewers to waffle pops sticks are the new bowls when it comes to food","story":"Combining the trend for small plates and the enduring appeal of street food, snacks on sticks have become ubiquitous. Plus: five you can make at homeIt’s the most primal way to eat, as old as cooking itself. As long as humans have had fire, we – and it does seem to be universal – have threaded edible things on to sticks and put them in or on the heat. So, food on a stick is nothing new. And yet, scroll through pictures of the hippest party spreads or the biggest restaurant openings on Instagram and you would be forgiven for thinking skewers were some newfangled thing.It’s not exactly surprising that it should be popular, given that it combines the customisable aspect of the bowl trend, the dipping-in-and-out inherent to the small plates fad and the enduring appeal of global street food. The website Grub Street recently reported on the ubiquity of the skewer in New York dining, from Nonono’s hard-boiled egg wrapped in bacon AKA breakfast on a stick to the spiral-sliced spud on a skewer, battered and deep-fried, at Queens night market, as well a newfound love in the city’s eateries for yakitori (Japanese chicken). And the UK is no different.Recent restaurant openings in London include Vietnamese street-style BBQ joint Mam, as well as a Covent Garden branch of Dalston’s yakitori hotspot, Jidori. Sticks’n’Sushi, meanwhile, has just opened a new King’s Road flagship store, bringing its nationwide offering to eight spots. The Danish chain’s marketing project manager, Mathias Leander, believes its brand of yakitori with a Nordic touch – and Japanese fusion in general – appeals because it is easy to eat and endlessly adaptable: “Beef, fish, shellfish, chicken or vegetables – there is something for everyone.”The skewer here isn’t necessarily integral to the cooking of the thing – its chief function is to keep things in place. Cubes of meat or fish on looped bamboo sticks discs of sesame-crusted cheese standing tall on lolly legs in buckets of edible sand mini sliders sorbet bombes, marshmallows with chocolate … the combinations are endlessly varied.You can see why the fashion crowd is partial to a skewer. An exercise in assemblage, it allows you to play with colours and textures, flavours and consistencies. And all in perfectly formed bite-sized shapes. Moreover, it is eminently portable. It requires no cutlery, and should result in little mess. It’s just the thing to eat as you mingle, drink in hand.You only need google “vegan skewers” to know that it’s not just chicken: vegan cheese, tofu, fake meats, a wealth of vegetables, it’s all there for the taking.There is, of course, an art to skewering meat. Karam Sethi, of the newly opened London Tandoori joint Brigadiers, says the benefit of using a wrought iron skewer, for example, is that it absorbs and conducts the heat, meaning the meat both cooks from the inside and chars on the outside. Elsewhere, when using bamboo skewers, you need to soak them in water first so they don’t burn. But as can be seen from the various recent trends for cake pops, waffle pops, frozen banana lollies or mini burgers on a stick, most things can be either cut up and pushed on to a stick or piled up and skewered into place. Make the stick that transports morsel to mouth something edible – a sprig of rosemary, say – and you hit peak skewer, flavouring, cooking and eating with a single tool.Perhaps most appealing of all, stick foods give the eater choice. Instead of each spoonful automatically combining all the ingredients of, say, a stew, with this assemblage of distinct pieces, you get to pick what to taste and when. Morales talks about the integrity of each ingredient. Ceviche does an anticucho with prunes, pork belly and burnt sugar. Depending on where you take the bite, he says, you can go really sweet or really savoury.And it’s not just the bite: it’s portion size, too. Skewers mean you choose how much you eat, an autonomy the Kitchn website, in its 2018 guide to wedding food trends, suggests eaters want. It says, for example, to treat dessert like a second cocktail hour, to get guests up mixing and talking after dinner. As caterer Chappall Gage puts it, sweet stick foods mean “people don’t have to commit to one dessert and can come back after dancing to have another bite later”.This flexible approach to eating might be why food on a stick is having such a moment. It is on-the-go fuel for the choose-your-own-adventure generation, the millennial multi-hyphenate’s nibble of choice.A meaty oneYotam Ottolenghi mixes minced meat (beef, lamb and lamb fat) with pistachio, cumin and chilli flakes, then squeezes it around water-soaked bamboo skewers and chargrills over a high heat.A fish oneNigel Slater marinates cubed swordfish (or tuna) in fennel and parsley then stacks on sticks with similarly cubed cucumber to lightly cook on or under a hot grill until golden.A cheese oneRoll skewered halloumi rounds in flour, then egg, then a mixture of black and white sesame seeds before deep-frying until golden.

Agreed? Good. With that established, let’s move on. Isn’t having to find something, dammit, anything to feed them across school holidays of the sort that are just beginning a total and utter pain in the arse?People who usually leave the house for work suddenly find themselves marooned at home, without adult company, standing in front of a fridge, the contents of which simply aren’t engineered for an extra daily meal. Those of us who always work from home have different issues. We usually pass lunch standing in front of the fridge, prodding leftovers to see whether they’ve developed a furry crust, eating salami straight from the packet and eyeing cautiously a half-eaten packet of cheese strings. As a result, we are justifiably baffled by how demanding our own children are. I give you breakfast. I sort dinner. And now you want more? Can’t you go out and get a job or chase a fox or something? So what if you’re only seven.From this comes a profound question one which goes to the very heart of middle-class parenting: what is the least you can get away with giving your kids for lunch during the school holidays before it starts looking like neglect, and the little darlings start emailing social services?Clearly at the top of this hierarchy of nutritional mediocrity is the bowl of curly pasta – don’t even think of trying to call it fusilli we’re deep in the nursery now – with grated drifts of plastic cheese. A big steaming bowl of complex carbohydrates has the virtue of making you feel like you cooked, which obviously is a fine and nurturing thing. But really, the effort! Come day three you’ll be properly bored of that.Which brings us to sandwiches. Are they OK? If sandwiches are OK, how about if you just nip out and buy them? Is that so bad? It’s what millions of people do every single day. In fact, wouldn’t you be doing your little ones a favour by introducing them to one of the key experiences of the world of work: the fridge-cold, utterly uninspiring supermarket sandwich, the eating of which represents the death of all your dreams and ambitions? Isn’t it better to ease them in to this stuff early?And what if, while patrolling those supermarket aisles for convenience items so they can get back to the killing fields of Fortnite and you can get back to arguing with the dozy git from accounts while still in your pyjamas, you happened to clock a few shelves of Pot Noodles? Obviously, they don’t feature highly on the healthy eating lists from the Department of Health. Likewise, the way they fizz when you add the water is mildly disturbing. But turning on the kettle is a kind of cooking, isn’t it? And that’s like parenting. Isn’t it? Or maybe you could just throw open the fridge door and get the children to form a huddle about your thighs, while you throw down the festering leftovers.At which point we must recognise that the issue of which I’m making light is, for those on low incomes, no laughing matter. We know free school meals can provide a much-needed form of support their removal during breaks is a cause of anxiety. So I’ve got a suggestion. Let’s abolish school holidays. It will rescue the kids from boredom, stop them discovering how unambitious a cook you are, and save dosh. It’s a modest proposal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/477d0252e191bd021bbc17ea2da43898aee47588/0_51_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21bf2d0536e8c664d01df16a69fb7063","title":"blackpool takeover valeri belokon owen oyston","story":"When the Latvian bank mogul Valeri Belokon won his landmark high court case against the Blackpool owner, Owen Oyston, last November, it seemed finally to deliver the means of ending Oyston’s long, toxic tenure at Bloomfield Road. Yet nearly a year on Oyston remains in charge despite the ruling that he “illegitimately stripped” the club of £26.77m after its one jackpot season in the Premier League, and must pay that huge sum to Belokon, plus the Latvian’s original £4.5m investment and costs.Belokon can seize and sell any Oyston assets to realise that £34m total but the club is out of his reach. He is prevented by the EFL’s owners and directors “fit and proper person” test, which bars people who have a criminal conviction involving dishonesty. Obscure as it appears, Belokon does have one, for money laundering, in the central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan, following a court hearing there last year in his absence.The Blackpool Supporters’ Trust has held demonstrations outside the EFL’s Preston headquarters, arguing it is outrageous that Oyston is not banned, despite a 1996 conviction for rape, because the EFL does not take into account crimes committed before its test was introduced in 2004.Belokon said in March he was “working with the EFL to provide them with the necessary information” to show “why I should be considered fit and proper”. He denounced the Kyrgyz conviction as “politically motivated”, claiming it “ignored the most basic principles of natural justice”. The EFL told the  that following discussions it had “clearly identified the additional information required” if it is to disregard the conviction and overturn the ban and was “committed to reviewing the position” when it receives it.Belokon’s conviction in Kyrgyzstan, where corruption is entrenched and the rule of law inadequate, appears remote and lacking credibility but the government has succeeded with similar allegations against Belokon in court proceedings in France.The Bakiyevs were ousted in April 2010 and the Kyrgyzstan national bank immediately took over five banks suspected of money-laundering – including Belokon’s. Belokon took the Kyrgyz government to arbitration and won in 2014 at a Paris hearing. The Kyrgyz government appealed and appointed the law firm King \u0026amp Wood Mallesons (KWM) to marshal the evidence.On 21 February 2017 the Paris court of appeal delivered a damning judgment in favour of the Kyrgyz government, finding that Belokon had bought Manas Bank in a rigged process, “in order to develop … money-laundering practices”. The court said such money laundering would not be monitored in Kyrgyzstan because of Belokon’s “privileged” relationship with Maxim Bakiyev. The arbitration award of $15m to Belokon for the loss of his bank must not be enforced, the court ruled, because to do so would reward him for “criminal activities”.Andrei Yakovlev, the KWM partner who represented the Kyrgyz government, told the  that his firm had thoroughly reviewed evidence and made further inquiries which formed the basis of the cases brought in the Paris court of appeal and for the criminal conviction in Kyrgyzstan three months later.The Paris court noted that after Belokon took over Manas Bank, $5.2bn flowed through its accounts in less than three years, and concluded this “dazzling success” in a poor country “cannot be explained by orthodox banking practices”.Bank records were presented to the court showing, the Kyrgyz government alleged, that accounts had been opened in the names of people whose identification documents, including passport details, had been stolen without their knowledge. One company, Lakerock Contracts Ltd, which was registered in New Zealand, had $534m go through its account in nine months. Examination of the company’s registration documents found that the named company head, and sole signatory for the multimillion-dollar account, was a taxi driver in Belarus. When interviewed on request by the Belarus police, he told officers that he had never signed any of the documents and knew nothing about Manas Bank or Lakerock.Another company presented in evidence by the Kyrgyz government, BMD Commerce, had $24m through its account in a year, including multimillion-dollar physical cash deposits and withdrawals. The authorised account holder on the Manas Bank forms was a resident of Latvia. The government submitted evidence that Latvian police and Kyrgyz border records showed this person to be a 20-year-old man who had never been to Kyrgyzstan. Subsequently the investigation found he was serving a prison sentence in Latvia when much of the account activity was taking place.Belokon argues that the criminal conviction and 20-year prison sentence in Kyrgyzstan that followed were politically motivated, government revenge for his win in the 2014 Paris arbitration. The Paris court of appeal judgment notes, however, that criminal proceedings did begin in Kyrgyzstan in January 2011. Belokon claims the criminal process “ignored the most basic principles of natural justice”, including that he was not even given notice that the court hearing was happening. The Kyrgyz government position is that Belokon was given notice of the proceedings but chose not to go the conviction records that he had lawyers at the court representing him.Yakovlev responded by explaining that his firm of lawyers had examined the Manas Bank files and electronic records, cross-checked evidence of money transfers, and that hundreds of people identified as account holders had been interviewed, some reinterviewed, by law enforcement authorities in several different countries. “A suggestion that the Kyrgyz authorities have falsified the evidence is not credible,” he said.Belokon said he intended to appeal against the Paris judgment but was blocked from doing so in July because he has not paid the costs – understood to be €300,000 – he was ordered to pay the Kyrgyz government. He said he intended to submit documents to the EFL demonstrating why he should be considered “fit and proper” to own Blackpool but is waiting until he has finished enforcing his judgment against Oyston.Oyston has told the  he is committed to paying Belokon the £34m and to keeping Blackpool going until he can find “a safe pair of hands” to buy the club.“As Valeri Belokon is banned, he can’t take it over,” Oyston said, “so it’ll have to be someone else.”But the judge added an important qualification. “Of course,” he said, “I know nothing about the events that have brought this exclusion of Mr Belokon about.”"},{"url":null,"title":"reigns game of thrones review devolver digital nerial","story":"iPhone, Android, PC Devolver DigitalNerialYou decide the fate of the denizens of Westeros in this Game of Thrones tie-in, which is, appropriately, a bloody riotAn endearing, witty mix of card game, Game of Thrones fan fiction and dating app, this mobile game is another brilliant thing to emerge thanks to George RR Martin’s meandering tales of dragons, feasts and blue-eyed zombies. In contrast to the aesthetic opulence of the TV series, the art is minimalist, but the colour all comes from the writing. As the various nefarious denizens of Westeros and beyond come to you with their problems, you swipe left or right to decide how to deal with them, uncovering plots and secrets as you advance your reign.Reigns: Game of Thrones lets you play out hundreds of potential futures for Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Cersei Lannister and other potential leaders of the Seven Kingdoms. These are nestled cleverly within Game of Thrones lore as visions in Red Priestess Melisandre’s fire – she of the flowing red hair and womb full of dark magic, perhaps best remembered as the only character in the entirety of the books and TV series who actually liked Stannis Baratheon. A round lasts just a few minutes, as you make quick decisions to try to stave off your inevitable demise for as long as possible.Appropriately for a game based on Game of Thrones, death is swift and frequent, and quickly forgotten. Playing as Tyrion, I couldn’t suppress a laugh when the game calmly informed me that I’d been thrown into a cauldron of wildfire. Everything you do will annoy someone, whether it’s the Church of the Seven, the peasants or your rival rulers. To stay alive longer you must balance out your choices, throwing religious leaders a bone even though you hate them, or bunging some cash over to the Iron Bank. It’s quick-fire diplomacy, enlivened by random disasters and constant fleeting cameos from series’ gigantic cast.Even disastrously brief rounds are fun, but there are deeper stories hidden in these micro-encounters that require persistence to unearth. Sometimes I’d be getting really invested in what was happening when an unlucky run of decisions would end my reign prematurely – this is part of Reigns’ design, but still occasionally dispiriting, as it can be ages before a promising scenario turns up again. Worrying about managing your popularity, wealth and power sometimes distracts from simply enjoying the amusing scenarios that the game throws up. The writing is great: concise but witty, always in-character, and peppered with references for Game of Thrones fans to relish.It might look slight, but there are hours of schemes, conversations and grisly deaths tucked away in this game. Broadening your choice of rulers takes some time, and even the same situations play out differently when Tyrion is in charge rather than Sansa, especially when you’re playing in character. It’s great fun to step into the unenviable position of Ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, and a far more enjoyable way to pass the time until the HBO series’ conclusion than combing through the books again for clues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49a69d92a9f304aacd7bcb07f5342be09fb7457a/234_313_7718_4631/master/7718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93624d54c567602c42b4891b90d52f11","title":"how climate change forces farmers into slavery in cambodias brick kilns in pictures","story":"Heatwaves and drought have devastated crops in rural Cambodia, forcing many farmers to abandon the fields and take work in the country’s burgeoning brick industry, where they become trapped in debt bondage.

So why was he so driven to track him down?Mim Shaikh is explaining why he went looking for his father. “My nan always said to me that when you turn 25, you become a real man,” the the BBC 1Xtra presenter says. “That’s when you know your own mind and can make proper choices.”Now 27, Shaikh does seem to have changed in the past two years. He is still as warm and good-humoured as he was when we last met, but he seems more serious. It was the death of his grandmother in 2016, he tells me, that “changed everything” for him.“I’ve always been curious about my dad,” he explains. “But never enough to go and find out, because I felt like it would be disloyal to my nan, who’d done so much for me.” After the breakup of her marriage, Shaikh’s mother was too unwell to look after him, so her widowed mother brought him up and took the decision to sever all contact with his father. “I was a single-parent kid, but my nan was my parent, not my mum,” is how he puts it.The long-lost father has become something of a trope in TV and film: from characters such as Darth Vader to countless father-reveal plotlines on EastEnders. Often the absent dad is a lovable rogue perhaps he was young and foolish back in the day and didn’t mean for things to turn out as they did. As an audience we are primed to root for an emotional reunion. But what happens when a fairytale ending comes with a darker twist?It’s a question that hangs over Shaikh’s new hour-long BBC documentary, Finding Dad, in which he goes in search of the father he has not seen since he was a baby – whom he has never even seen a picture of. It’s a journey that sees him crossing continents, discovering new relatives, but also uncovering old wounds.For years all Shaikh knew of his father was what he had been told by his mother’s family. That is that his mum met his dad when her family responded to an advert he had placed in a newspaper looking for a wife (both families had roots in Pakistan, and this was a not-uncommon occurrence in south Asian communities at the time). Shaikh’s parents met, married and settled in Dudley, near Birmingham.Shaikh’s father quickly became abusive, he was told, allegedly hitting his mother and locking her in their home. Shaikh’s mother, who was 19 years younger than his dad, had significant learning difficulties and mental health issues. Under the strain of her difficult marriage, we are told in the documentary, she deteriorated further. When Shaikh’s grandmother discovered what was happening, she immediately set about removing her daughter – and the then-infant Shaikh. All contact with Shaikh’s father was stopped. By then, however, Shaikh’s mother was unable to care for the boy, so his grandmother looked after them both.The three lived in south London, mainly in the Phipps Bridge housing estate in Mitcham. Money was tight, although the community rallied round, with neighbours and relatives helping to care for Shaikh and his mother. Shaikh struggled with feelings of anger and alienation, and what makes the documentary so engaging is his openness about how the situation affected him. This is also something he has addressed in his spoken-word work. In No Father’s Day, he recalls never having his mum or dad attend parents’ evening at school, only an aunt or uncle, and how it felt to have “classmates staring at your mum because she’s talking to herself”. Shaikh has described his relationship with his mother as closer to big brother and little sister: he has to look after her. Yet he says it has also encouraged him in his career, as he has risen from a baby-faced YouTube prankster serenading passersby to poet, presenter and actor – his most recent role being in the current BBC drama Informer.“I think if you’re born into a single-parent family, there’s a drive to be a success. If I’m unsuccessful, there’s no one left to look after my mum. So I feel have to become successful in order to provide and live a good life.” Yet there is also a darker legacy, he admits. In a poem he reads aloud in the documentary, he wonders if children from abusive parents are “bad seeds” and “destined to do the same deed”. So why, if the stories he heard about his father were so negative, did he still want to track him down?“I wanted the Disney ending so much,” he says. “I wanted him to put his arm around me and say, ‘Don’t worry, son, it’s all OK now. Don’t worry about all the birthdays that I missed – we’re together now.”Shaikh begins his journey with the documents he does have – the first few photos he has ever seen of his father, and a birth certificate stating his dad’s name. He follows these to Birmingham, to a mosque he believes his father frequented, and is introduced to three community elders. This meeting, like many of the others in the documentary, is painful to watch: Shaikh’s eager questions are met with awkward silences and subtext-laden answers. The interviewees appear to be using euphemisms to avoid hurting him – his father was “impatient”, they say, and “badly behaved”. But, finally Shaikh has his breakthrough: one of the men lived with his father and can confirm not only that he is alive, but can supply his address – in Pakistan.Which is where they eventually meet, after many calls in which Shaikh’s father puts the phone down on him. Persistence pays off, and as in all the best stories, father and son embrace and seem thrilled to find each other.But while the reunion is emotional, there is no neatly tied-up happy ending. When Shaikh begins asking questions about his parents’ marriage, his father denies everything, both the abuse and the abandonment (arguing the family conspired against him), while Shaikh gets a further surprise in the shape of his father’s two young sons. Suddenly he has brothers. “I’ve grown up my whole life as an only child,” he says. “And I found out later that it wasn’t just those two. From other relationships of my dad, there’s an influx of siblings. It’s a big thing to adjust your mind to.” Shaikh is still figuring out how much his father and siblings will be in his life. “Water isn’t thicker than blood, but sometimes it can be,” he says.Did he get the answers he craved? He wasn’t persuaded by his father’s version of events, he says, but still found some kind of resolution. And he was surprised by how much he felt at home in Pakistan. “My whole life I’ve been wrestling with identity issues,” he says. “Pakistan is in my blood – both my parents are from there. Before that I always thought I was more British than south Asian.”The experience also gave him a more profound understanding of his grandmother’s love. “There is no one that was stronger than her, mentally, in my family. Losing her was a big loss. But if she had never made those decisions, I wouldn’t be where I am. She – and my aunties in my family – they just make the men look weak.”It has also changed his perception of himself, and of the kind of man he wants to be. “It made me stronger. And it makes me want to be a good dad for when I have kids, even more. I can never turn around and do something like that to my child.

The evening meal of pan-fried mushrooms, fillet of turbot and a trio of fruit sorbets was fairly wolfed down by the EU’s 27 heads of state and government around the oval dining table on the 11th floor of the lantern-shaped Europa building in Brussels.Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron even had time for a post-prandial stroll on an unseasonably warm Brussels evening, before hopping in a car to the Grand Place’s Le Roy d’Espagne bar to join the prime ministers of Belgium and Luxembourg for a beer.This had been earmarked as the meaty summit, with long discussions going late into the evening, hopefully ending in a champagne moment. Earlier in the day, Theresa May had told reporters of the great progress that had been made. Michel Barnier, however, could only offer the leaders some unpalatable truths as they picked over their fish. There was no indication that a deal was possible given the British prime minister’s vulnerability at home. May had offered nothing new in what leaders had described as a nervy 15-minute address in an ante room on the third floor, leaving little for them to chew on. The prime minister had optimistically claimed that a deal was in reach at the start of her presentation - only to end with a “cry for help” in which she emphasised the difficulties of her predicament at home, one EU diplomat said. The time was at hand to step up preparations for a no-deal Brexit, the leaders agreed. The conditions were not right for a November summit. A December summit was looking like the last opportunity to save the day.“There is a certain difference in the assessment of where we are now,” admitted an EU official of the conclusions reached by the leaders at the end of their two-hour dinner. “Where May certainly has to a certain extent a positive assessment of where we are, focused on the considerable progress that has been made on a number of issues, and emphasises that a deal is in reach, I think the collective feeling among the EU 27, I would say, is somewhat more sceptical and notes the lack of progress or at least the lack of agreement at this stage.”Following presentations by Barnier and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, 12 leaders made interventions over the dinner. The most notable was that of the Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who brandished an  article on the 1972 IRA bombing of a border customs post as he sought to stiffen the resolve of his political peers and highlight the risks of giving way on the border problem that has so dogged the negotiations. But it wasn’t necessary, diplomats said.The headline news of the summit was the British prime minister’s indication that she would be open to the EU’s offer of an extension of the transition period “by a few months” to offer some assurances at home that the backstop keeping Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union and single market after Brexit would never come into force. No one, however, was left under any assurance that the Gordian knot of ensuring that a hard Irish border would not return could be unpicked. Juncker suggested to the leaders that they needed to help May, without spelling out how.“The same problems remain, and it is up to the British to sort out the mess,” an EU official said. “I trust you haven’t got any plans for Christmas.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66e9c980850a06fe53bf22e692cfbc49541b8275/0_250_5928_3557/master/5928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c13c00d56fa224139992db29b772fef","title":"eu brexit backstop plan remains unacceptable to may","story":"Senior figures stress that Theresa May is not about to sign up to Northern Ireland backstopTheresa May continues to believe the EU’s proposal for avoiding a hard border in Ireland is unacceptable, senior UK officials have stressed, after a plan to consider an extension to the post-Brexit transition period raised fears she was about to sign up to a Northern Ireland-only backstop.The prime minister told fellow leaders on Wednesday evening she was open to extending the transition period – one proposal mooted during intensive talks over the Irish backstop issue, which broke down without agreement last weekend.The EU has proposed that Northern Ireland in effect stay in the customs union and single market after December 2020, at the end of the transition period, should there be no deal in place that would avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.Arriving in Brussels on Thursday morning, May said: “The original proposal from the EU was one we could not accept in the UK. It would have created a customs border down the Irish Sea.“Earlier in the year we put forward a proposal as to how to deal with this issue a further idea that has emerged - and it is an idea at this stage - is to create an option to extend the implementation period for a matter of months, and it would be for a matter of months.”Senior UK officials later played down the idea the move should be regarded as a significant concession – and suggested even if the UK signed up to a clause allowing an extension, it would not intend to use it.The mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.\u0026nbspThat committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no ergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026nbspBut it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\u0026nbspThe problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.\u0026nbspThe backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.\u0026nbspThe new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.\u0026nbspBut an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.\u0026nbspThe Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is\u0026nbsp a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspExtending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between £10bn and £17bn.\u0026nbspStaying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the\u0026nbspEuropean court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.\u0026nbsp“The key point here is that there would be no intention of actually implementing any extension,” the senior official said.Asked whether mooting an extension meant the UK was willing to sign up to a Northern Ireland-only backstop – on the basis that it was unlikely ever to be triggered – he said: “We have said repeatedly that the backstop put forward by the EU is unacceptable that remains the case.”Some of May’s Conservative colleagues have been infuriated, and others baffled, by the idea of a longer transition, which would mean the UK remained subject to EU laws and regulations, in which it would no longer have a say – and would continue paying into the EU budget.Backbencher Anna Soubry said: “She’s reneging on everything and pickling everyone off.”Former Tory minister Nick Boles described the attempt to extend the transition period as a “desperate last move”, and suggested May was losing the confidence of her party.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the EU was demanding “humiliating concessions”.The backstop, an insurance policy to avoid the imposition of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, is the key remaining sticking point in the fraught Brexit talks.May’s cabinet colleagues have insisted she cannot sign up to anything that would leave only Northern Ireland subject to customs and single market rules and are also adamant the backstop cannot be indefinite.May’s DUP allies, upon whom she relies on to get legislation through the House of Commons, have also warned her against making significant new concessions, and even threatened to vote down the budget if she entertains the idea of a Northern Ireland-only solution.David Davis and Boris Johnson sought to step up the pressure on May by signing a letter, alongside other former cabinet ministers, urging her to reject any backstop at all.“Talk of either a UK or a Northern Irish backstop is inimical to our status as a sovereign nation state. Both are unnecessary: indeed they are a trap being set by the EU which it is vital we do not fall into,” they said.They urged the prime minister not to “engage in a show of resistance and a choreographed argument followed by surrender and collapse into some version of the backstop and Chequers”.Privately, UK officials suggest they are only entertaining the idea of an extension in order to help oil the wheels of the negotiations. They have been desperate to avoid a repeat of last month’s Salzburg summit, where EU leaders openly expressed their frustration at what they regarded as the UK’s intransigence.May had been urged to arrive at Wednesday night’s dinner with “new facts” to offer EU leaders but the extension of the transition appears to be the only new idea that emerged.EU officials were surprised by the prime minister’s sunny outlook in her address to leaders on the state of the negotiations. After May’s 15-minute presentation on Wednesday, the 27 leaders instead spoke of the “grave” state of the negotiations, and agreed to up their readiness for a no-deal Brexit, sources said.“There is a certain difference in the assessment of where we are now,” admitted one senior EU official. “Where May certainly has to a certain extent a positive assessment of where we are, focused on the considerable progress that has been made on a number of issues and emphasises that a deal is in reach and where I think the collective feeling among the EU27, I would say, is somewhat more sceptical and notes the lack of progress or at least the lack of agreement at this stage.”However, UK officials said despite EU leaders’ decision to pull plans for a November summit to seal the Brexit deal, they were still hopeful a deal could be done. “Our point of view is just getting this done, as soon as we can.”EU leaders have not ruled out the idea of a November summit, if Michel Barnier says enough progress has been made but for the moment the next European council in leaders’ diaries is in December – leaving the government little time to get parliament’s approval.David Lidington, effectively May’s deputy, conceded on Thursday that extending the transition would be likely to carry a cost – though he denied it would amount to billions of pounds.“That would be one of the things that would be teased out in the negotiations,” adding: “There may be other approaches we can take.”Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, said the cost to the UK taxpayer of extending the transition period would only be settled once it was clear how much longer the country would remain under EU laws."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c45a1575ffcb03dbd75b2a67cf2bc445e014d24c/0_90_5897_3538/master/5897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31e78f8278aba44195bbddeedde35e2b","title":"tell us are you taking part in the peoples vote march","story":"Share your views if you plan to be in London on 20 October and tell us a little about whyThousands of people are expected to march in London on Saturday calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.Organisers of the People’s Vote March for the Future demonstration on 20 October say they hope at least 100,000 people will attend after similar numbers were seen in June.Theresa May has repeatedly rejected the idea of a second referendum on Brexit, but on Wednesday said she was open to extending the transition period in an effort to solve the Irish border issue.We would like to find out more about your views on the concept of a people’s vote and the march in London.

The winner, Fantom, ridden by Englishman George Sayers received 11,700 florins for his owner Count von Cramm. The race has been held every year since on the second Sunday in October – except during the two world wars and the 1968 Russian invasion, and it has been abandoned twice due to frost and snow.Pardubice is around 100km east of Prague in the East Bohemia region of the Czech Republic and is well known as a horse-loving area. A horse is even on the city’s crest. The area is also known for its gingerbread and is home to the Explosia chemical plant in the Semtin suburb, where semtex was invented in 1964.The course at Pardubice is a mixture of turf and ploughed fields. In the first decades, almost half of the race was run over ploughed fields. This was later reduced to about a third, but now it is down to a quarter as the terrain is very draining on the horses. The three water jumps are across a stream that runs through the course, and used to be so deep that horses and jockeys who fell would be up to their necks in water. For safety reasons concrete troughs were erected above the stream so now the jumps are less than a foot deep.The main race is four miles and two furlongs long and has 31 fences. Each obstacle is unique with many given names: Irish Bank, English Jump, Water Course, Havel’s Jump, Big Water Jump, Snake Ditch. Popler’s Jump is named after the jockey Rudolf Popler who died there in a race in 1932.The meeting attracts race fans from across Europe including a number from the United Kingdom such as Gary Hodgson from Sedgefield (above) celebrating his 60th birthday with a group of 15 friends from the north-east. He had previously visited Pardubice in 2008 when he came over to the race as part of his 50th birthday celebrations.The race’s most famous horse is Zeleznik, who won four times. He was always ridden by Josef Vana, the most successful jockey in the race having won it eight times out of 28 attempts. He is now a trainer and has had the winner 10 times. A statue of him (below) was unveiled in 2010.The record time to complete the race is 8min 56sec. It is a notoriously difficult course to navigate for jockeys, featuring many twists and turns. In 2008 Amant Gris crossed the line first in the big race but was disqualified for taking the wrong route. It is so tough that some people have given it the nickname The Devil’s Race. Twenty-four horses have attempted both the Pardubice and the Grand National at Aintree. No horse has ever won both.One fence has become the symbol of the race – Velky Taxisuv Prikop or Great Taxis Ditch. It is the most notorious, difficult and dreaded fence which is jumped only once a year in the Velka. No one can jump it in training or qualification races. It was included in the first race back in 1874 and at first riders were keen on getting rid of it but a group of racegoers led by Count Egun Thurn-Taxis managed to persuade the organisers to keep it in the race. The fence was named after him and is certainly the biggest fence jumped in a race anywhere in the world.In 1992 animal rights campaigners protesting against the number of horses killed in the race invaded the course after hiding in the woods and managed to delay the running of the race. Since then alterations have been made to the course and fences to make it safer. The qualification criteria for both horse and jockey were also made tougher, thus making the standard of entry higher. In addition to this the course has four qualification races for the Velka that are run at Pardubice over the summer.The current form of the Taxis fence was formed in 1993 when the hedgerow was lowered to 140cm and is now as high as it is wide. The ditch was partially filled up and is now one metre deep. Now horse and rider have to jump over an eight-metre distance.British jockey Andrew Glassonbury told the Racing Post before the race: “I’m not phased by the Taxis Ditch. Like every jump, you gallop down to it and just hope you get over it. The horse will do the jumping and hopefully I’m still there with him if he does!”When I saw the Taxis for the first time I thought those who claimed it was jumpable were joking. The Taxis is without doubt the toughest of the tough, it takes the biscuit. It’s probably the hardest obstacle in the world”Chris Collins, a British amateur jockey who won the 1973 race on Stephen’s SocietyThere were 20 runners in this year’s race. Eleven finished, six fell, one unseated its rider and two pulled up. Of the six fallers, five fell at Great Taxis Ditch, jump number four in the race.Thomas Boyer loses his seat on Templar as they clear the Taxis.Josef Bartos (left) falls off Vicody (not shown) at the Taxis fence while Thomas Boyer (right) is unseated by Templar (No 10). Bartos, the most successful Czech jockey of all time who has won the race twice, was unscathed after the fall but Vicody was injured and sadly had to be put down after the race. The fence has claimed the lives of over 30 horses and the BHA has stated that it would not allow a race of this kind ever to be run in the United Kingdom.British jockey Leighton Aspell walks back to the weighing room after falling off his horse Vajgaros at the Irish Bank, the fence after Great Taxis Ditch. Aspell has won two Grand Nationals (in 2014 and 2015). He first rode at Pardubice in 2006 but this year was his first attempt in the Velka. Three other British jockeys took part with Thomas Garner third and James Best and Andrew Glassonbury both completing the course.One of the horses who didn’t fall at the Taxis was 9-1 shot Tzigane Du Berlais, with Jan Faltejsek up, seen here going over fence 25. At the last fence, number 31, Tzigane Du Berlais and Faltejsek were fifth but down the very long final straight they caught and then powered past the field in front of them to take victory.Tzigane Du Berlais is trained by Pavel Tuma, making it the 13th successive year a Czech-trained horse has won. It also meant the long winless spell for British jockeys continues, with Charlie Mann the last to taste victory in 1995 on It’s A Snip.It was Faltejsek’s fifth win in the race, in fact he has won five of its last seven runnings. This year there was five million crowns (koruna) in prize money for the race, with the winner taking home two million crowns (just under £70,000).The Czech jockey has ridden in England in the past and is probably most famous in the UK for riding Knockara Beau, memorably beating Big Buck’s in the 2014 Cleeve Hurdle at Cheltenham. He won 38 races in the UK mainly for trainer George Charlton and had two rides in the Gold Cup finishing sixth and seventh. The 35-year-old jockey said it would be a dream to ride in the Grand National but admitted that dream has probably faded as you now need to be riding in Britain for a British trainer.After the day’s racing is done, traditionally the racegoers are allowed on to the course to see the obstacles up close and many racegoers take their chance to grab a special photo in front of the massive Taxis fence.Our thanks go to Czech Tourism, without whom this trip would not have been possible, if you would like to attend next year’s event or visit the Czech Republic please go to: www.czechtourism"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2d44f33dcc78710b7701a4a66ca8b8b264a9adf/0_82_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80f028799c3332b539323fab2f4dcd73","title":"lebron james los angeles lakers nba","story":"The spectacle of his late career will be as much about watching the emergence of LeBron the cultural figure as the twilight of LeBron the playerJames has shaved on-court expectations, stressing the inexperience of his supporting cast this season. The Lakers have been bad in recent years, though under young coach Luke Walton they’ve at least begun a mild recovery from 2015-16, when they went 17–65 to record their worst season ever. Thanks to favorable draft picks, there’s now plenty of raw talent. Brandon Ingram, who gets about the court with the languid elasticity of a semi-animated linguine, has set himself the goal of being an All-Star this season, which is perhaps unrealistic in the hyper-competitive Western Conference but at least shows ambition. Lonzo Ball, the roster’s other starlet, will help share some of the burden in driving offensive play – a luxury James missed in his draining final season with the Cavs. But in truth the Lakers, for whom James will make his regular-season debut on Thursday night, are probably one star-player away from a genuine shot at the championship. But let’s not forget that James is only 33. Karl Malone, with a similar build to LeBron, was almost 36 by the time he collected his second MVP award, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was a title winner into his early 40s. Providing LeBron’s body holds up – and it’s proved remarkably resilient over the years – there’s still plenty of time left to add to his already absurd record of achievement in the sport.Indeed, the spectacle of his late career will be as much about watching the emergence of LeBron James the cultural product as the twilight of LeBron James the player. How James juggles that handover will be the defining dilemma of his final years on the court. How much more than an athlete can he be while still maintaining his peak of athleticism? When James announced he was joining the Lakers, the move was almost immediately seen through the prism of his post-basketball aspirations. It was a Hollywood play, in the literal sense: a move that got him closer to the film industry, in prime position for a lucrative post-playing career on screen. The July announcement of a deal with HBO to produce The Shop offered early confirmation of that thesis. Then last month came news that James will star in Space Jam 2. James has always been acutely conscious of Michael Jordan’s shadow, but the decision to helm a sequel of Jordan’s 1996 hit seemed a little ostentatious, as if James was trying just a little too hard to outdo the master – even off the court. The Shop – which riffs on the barbershop’s centrality as a cherished gathering place for African American communities – is pitched as a forum for “unfiltered” discussion between James and a number of other celebrities about life, politics, sport and culture: James and pals unplugged, essentially. The first mostly revolved around Jon Stewart talking a lot and Golden State Warriors star Draymond Green drinking red wine from a very large glass, a discordantly bougie note belying the show’s aspirations to barbershop realness. But the most intriguing performer is James himself. It isn’t so much what he says that marks his performance as what he doesn’t say - namely, anything memorable. “Why I’m still doing what I’m doing is because I want to continue to inspire, not only the people in my household, but everybody that I can while I can,” he intones at one point, to deep nods from Stewart. It’s inspiring stuff – and deeply uninteresting.The Space Jam reboot, a chat show that aspires to authenticity but rarely gets there: where is James going with all of this? With the final chapter of his playing career in sight, he seems torn between a desire to make a real difference as a political and social actor and the commercial demands of LeBron The Business. From the day as a high school sophomore that he took Jordan’s 23 as his shirt number, James has always measured himself against the Chicago Bulls legend. Though the debate to decide the better player remains vigorous, there’s little contest when it comes to figuring out who’s been the more consequential cultural figure. Whether he did or did not once say that “Republicans buy sneakers, too,” as is claimed, Jordan was famously apolitical throughout his career. He steered clear of commentary on the racial outrages of the day, and managed his image with a painstaking anxiety not to piss anyone off. It’s important to give this achievement the recognition it deserves. James is part of a rare generation of global sporting superstars that includes Roger Federer, Serena Williams, Lionel Messi, and Cristiano Ronaldo. All of them have emerged at (roughly) the same time, and each has a legitimate claim to being the greatest to ever play their chosen sport. James alone has systematically used his exalted athletic status to amplify issues beyond sport. No doubt the attention given to LeBron’s political interventions is in part a function of America’s unique global cultural influence, but it’s also a reflection of temperament. It would be tough to imagine any other member of this generation of superstars doing what James does. Federer is so doggedly apolitical and inoffensive you’d be hard pressed to get him to express an opinion on anything stronger than milk his reaction the day after the Brexit vote was to note, “Us Swiss guys, we’re going to follow it.” Ronaldo is an accused rapist Messi hardly says anything off the pitch. Serena comes closest to matching LeBron’s cultural clout – on issues of race and gender inequality, for example, she’s opened up conversations in ways that few other athletes could – but her religion mandates a strict political neutrality. But how far can James’s transcendence go? To what end will he put his new-found moral authority? Again, the parallels with Jordan are instructive. Retired, Jordan has stayed mostly true to neutral type. In 2016, however, he finally broke character and spoke out on the issue of police brutality. “I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of African Americans at the hands of law enforcement and angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers,” he said in a statement. Jordan took a moment of unique outrage against the police and used it to pledge $1m each to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Institute for Community-Police Relations. His reckoning with police brutality was to conclude that everyone was at fault. Finally, after decades on the fence, Jordan committed politically – to bothsidesism. Jordan’s disappointingly apolitical entry into the political fray illustrates the difficulties of the post-career pivot. Jordan’s identity – as a wealthy retiree who avoids ruffling partisan-political feathers and mostly communicates in public through a spokesperson – is set, and nothing much that happens from here will change that. Once the act is in train, it’s difficult to set it on a different course: there is a cautionary tale here for James, who is still figuring out what he will be once he stops playing. This presents both a danger and an opportunity. The danger is that he’ll half-ass his politics that he’ll become a gauzy do-gooder who traffics in lazy Hollywood comedies and the kind of ready-to-wear inspirational quotes that already gum up every corner of the internet, pausing only to offer routine smackdowns on the occasional social injustice. The opportunity is for him to go beyond symbolism and use the work he does through his foundation to engage more meaningfully with politics, to not simply be another rich guy but to join the political fight to remedy the deep causes of poverty and racial injustice. It would be the easiest thing in the world for him to coast through his late career and into retirement – one foot in Hollywood, the other in Akron. But is that really what he wants? That, surely, would represent an abdication of the very LeBronness that has defined his playing career: his determination not simply to be the best, but the best in a radically original way. You don’t declare yourself “more than an athlete” only to reinvent yourself as a t-shirt salesman. Apart from Snoop Dogg, Draymond Green was perhaps the only guest on the first episode of The Shop who met the show’s self-description as “unfiltered”. (Sample quote: “Jews look out for Jews.”) At one point Stewart asks James whether he thinks he’s earned the title of “best ever”. Green interjects: of course he has. “I think Bron over the last four years became LeBron James,” he continues. “And it wasn’t nothing to do with winning, it wasn’t nothing to do with stats. He found himself. People didn’t start to view him as they view him now until he became that force, that man to say, ‘I’m here.’” The foundation, the political platform, the social media following, the deal with HBO, a final tilt at a ring with the Lakers: James got himself here. What happens now is up to him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb8423ef0eda6f5e4133c219917a46285254d6e1/1_0_4394_2638/master/4394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2732af3f95d5301d8ea3abe5f31e0a5e","title":"google pixel 3 review android performance camera design","story":"New phone reaches Apple-level of polish, with top-notch performance, fantastic camera and attractive designThe Pixel 3 is Google’s third stab at making its own top-end phone, attempting to outshine the likes of Apple and Samsung with a terrific camera and a highly polished experience.The Pixel 3 is the smaller of the two new Google phones, with a 5.5in FHD+ OLED screen that is bright, crisp and vibrant. It is a beautiful display that is a significant step up from last year’s Pixel 2, with wide viewing angles with minimal colour shift.The Pixel 3 mirrors the design of last year’s Pixel 2 XL with a relatively large chin and forehead containing stereo speakers and various cameras. It’s fairly small by modern standards, making it easy to handle and pocket, similar to the Pixel 2, Apple’s iPhone XS and the Samsung Galaxy S9. It’s also light at 148g compared to the 177g iPhone XS and 168g Galaxy S9, both of which have slightly larger 5.8in screens.Gone is last year’s coated aluminium back, replaced with two-tone glass. The frosted bit is etched glass, which is super smooth, but is surrounded by polished glass and coated metal sides that aid your grip. The combination feels wonderfully smooth and luxurious in the hand. This is a phone you will want to fondle.In the centre of the back below the glossy panel is a fingerprint scanner as good last year’s. There are no other biometric security options, such as face unlock, despite the Pixel 3 having two front-facing cameras.The bottom of the phone has a USB-C port and a sim tray, while the right side volume button is joined by a mint green power button. There’s no headphone socket to be seen, but the camera only sticks out the back less than 1mm.The Pixel 3 has Qualcomm’s current top-of-the-line processor, the Snapdragon 845, as used in the OnePlus 6 and most other current flagship smartphones, with the exception of the UK versions of Samsung’s S9 and Note 9 and Huawei’s phones, both of which use their own-brand chips.The Pixel 3 only has 4GB of RAM, compared with 6GB or even 8GB in some top-end Android competitors. While it might lose in a game of Top Trumps, it’s not noticeable in daily use because the Pixel 3 is so buttery smooth in operation, with top-notch gaming performance too.The whole system, from switching apps to pulling up the camera, has a level of polish only matched by Apple’s iOS on the iPhone XS. It’s not quite as brutally rapid as the OnePlus 6 in operation, simply because the animations play out for longer, but it’s easily faster and slicker than any other Android device.Battery life for the Pixel 3 is a moving target. Normally smartphones stabilise to a fairly consistent level after a couple of days of first starting them up.That was with consistent use as my primary device sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music with Spotify on Bluetooth headphones, watching 30 minutes of Netflix and shooting about 10 photos a day.Part of that is undoubtedly down to the Adaptive Battery technology in Android 9 Pie that learns your usage pattern and limits power to apps you don’t really use. It’s possible that over the next couple of weeks battery life may continue to improve, although it is unlikely to be by vast amounts.A full charge via the included 18w fast charger took 101 minutes. The Pixel 3 can also charge wirelessly at up to 10w, which is a little slower than via cable but still faster than some phones charge from their bundled chargers.The Pixel 3 runs the latest version of Android 9 Pie, which makes it one of only handful of phones to do so.The main advantages of Pie over previous versions are better notification handling, particularly around do not disturb (DND) modes, wellbeing tool integration for tracking usage and modes to deter usage, such as Wind Down, and great integration of AI systems.Exclusive to the Pixel 3 is Google’s smart compose for Gmail, which takes the advanced autocomplete you might have used in Gmail in the browser on desktop to the Gmail app on the phone. It’s scarily good at writing emails.Google has also removed the traditional home and overview navigation buttons, replacing them by a pill-shaped gesture button in the middle and a small back arrow to the left.The back button still does what you’d expect, but the gesture button does a number of things. Tap it to go home, tap and hold to invoke Google Assistant, flick it upwards once to get to the app switcher or twice to get to the app drawer (you can also go straight to the app drawer by dragging it further up the screen).Dragging the gesture button to the right turns it into a slider flicking between recently used apps as you move your finger across the bar. Flicking the button to the right switches straight to the last used app in the same way a double-tap on the overview button used to.It works fine, but there is a bit of getting used to and I don’t think it’s actually faster than the previous navigation buttons. It also isn’t as smooth and intuitive as Apple’s gesture bar system introduced with the iPhone X, or some other gesture systems used by the likes of OnePlus or Huawei.It is safe to say the Pixel 3 has one of the best, if not the best cameras available today.The rear 12-megapixel camera is capable of capturing stunning images, rich in detail, vibrancy and dynamic range. It is better than any other at bringing out detail and colour from high-contrast scenes where there are a mix of bright lights and dark corners thanks to Google’s HDR+ algorithms.Low light performance is also fantastic, and that’s before the promised Night Sight mode that will come in a software update soon, which Google says will be able to produce dramatically better night-time shots.What sets the Pixel 3 apart from the competition is that it can do all this with practically no user skill whatsoever – this is the point-and-shoot that will make you look like you know what you’re doing even if you don’t.Google’s Top Shot works as advertised, using on-device AI to discern if one of the many frames it captures before and after you hit the shutter button is better than your attempt, for when someone blinks or cuts across your field of view.Likewise, Super Res Zoom is far better than standard digital zoom, but can’t quite match the clarity of Apple’s hybrid zoom using the iPhone XS’s 2x telephoto lens at extended zooms.Two selfie cameras adorn the front: a standard 8-megapixel camera joined but a wide-angle fixed focus camera allowing you to zoom out one step. At normal zoom levels the camera captures a stunning amount of detail even in crummy lighting conditions – if you have flaws in your skin this camera will capture them in all their glory.The wide-angle selfie helps you fit more people in, but the images it captured aren’t quite as good.Portrait mode for both front and rear cameras has been improved, particularly around hair, and now with the ability adjust blur both in the background and foreground after the fact. The motion autofocus is also magic, making macro shots a lot easier – tap on an object and the focus follows it around.The Google Pixel 3 is available for £739 with 64GB of storage or £839 with 128GB of storage, in a choice of black, white or pink.The Pixel 3 can be summed up in one word: refinement.Every element of Android 9 Pie is slick and responsive. It’s simple to use but powerful in its execution. From the simply brilliant camera to the auto-complete in Gmail, on-device AI proves truly useful. Plus you get at least three years of software updates, which is still a rarity outside of Apple’s iPhone.The outside of the phone feels luxurious, but in a different way to the iPhone XS. The way the etched glass blends into the polished glass and body looks and feels beautiful.Inside and out the Pixel 3 is more polished than any other Android smartphone, fully justifying Google’s entry into the big leagues.It’s not perfect, of course the battery life could certainly do with being longer, and a glass back will be less durable than metal. There’s also no face unlocking and the relatively large chin and forehead will look dated in a year or so.But there’s absolutely no doubt that if you don’t want a £999 iPhone XS, the Pixel 3 is the best small smartphone going.Pros: super smooth and fluid performance, great screen, squeezable sides, Android 9 Pie and 3 years of updates, water resistant, fantastic camera, wireless chargingCons: relatively large chin and forehead, no expandable storage or removable battery, no headphone jack, battery life could be better, no face recognition"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d327d9ee6d7bbd8c07708abdf4b0478a59fddf5/192_567_5426_3256/master/5426.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22a605668aa0720e297c5998dfcb8c47","title":"what is the best windows desktop pc computer monitor under 200 pounds","story":"Keith has just switched to a Windows desktop PC and needs a good monitor to go with itI have just switched to a Windows desktop computer and need to get a good monitor – about 21 inches and under £200. Do you have any advice? KeithThere are two ways to pick a monitor, and it’s worth using both approaches. The first is to go into a shop and see which one looks best. It’s much easier to compare screens side by side. The second is to compile a table of specifications and pick the monitor that meets your needs. Reading spec sheets doesn’t guarantee that you’ll find a monitor that looks good, but this generally isn’t a problem nowadays. The quality of flat screens has improved dramatically over the past 10-15 years, and it’s quite hard to find a bad one, unless it’s a faulty product.The prices of standard PC monitors and flat screen TVs have also fallen dramatically. Monitors start at less than £100 and you can get a good one for less than £150. Of course, you can pay up to £1,000 for a bigger, faster, high-resolution screen, but you don’t need that sort of monitor unless you’re a keen gamer or a video editor. There’s one specification to watch out for: some cheap monitors have TN (Twisted Nematic) LCD screens. They are not necessarily bad, but IPS (In Plane Switching) and LED backlit screens are brighter and have richer colours.In general, a brightness of around 200 candela per square metre, “200 nits”, is enough for use in normal indoor lighting, and 120-200 cdm2 used to be common. However, there’s a trend towards brighter screens, with 500cdm2 being preferred for movies. HDTV sets go even higher.If a screen is too bright, you can always turn it down. Only if it’s too dim do you have a problem.Today’s standard PC monitor has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which matches the TV industry definitions for 1080p and Full High Definition (Full HD) movies. As prices have come down, some people are moving to Quad HD (2560 x 1440) and Ultra HD (3840 x 2160). There are also ultra-wides (2560 x 1080) that avoid having two screens side by side.Normal screen sizes vary from around 21.5in to 28in, and 24in is currently the sweet spot. Most of these screens have the same 1920 x 1080 resolution, so you won’t fit any more information on a bigger screen. However, everything on the screen will be slightly bigger and easier to read. Against that, a bigger screen will also have fewer pixels per inch (ppi), so it will look less sharp.Unless you’re on a tight budget, there’s not much point in buying anything smaller than 24in, because you won’t save any space. In fact, today’s small bezels provide bigger screens without increasing the overall size of the monitor.But if you decide on a 27in or larger screen, go for Quad HD resolution instead of Full HD … or sit further away from the screen.Most flat screens have a refresh rate of 60Hz, which is fine for most purposes. Doubling it to 120Hz makes things smoother, but it means your PC has to send the screen twice as many frames per second. A PC that runs a popular game at, say, 88fps isn’t going to make it, even if the monitor can handle it.It’s clearly better to have a screen with a higher refresh rate, but it doesn’t make much practical difference for people who aren’t gamers.Obviously, you have to connect the screen to your PC, and there are lots of ways to do that. The main ones for your purposes are VGA, DVI, DisplayPort and HDMI. Check your PC to see which ones you can use.You’re unlikely to need VGA or DVI unless you have an old PC. HDMI and, especially, DisplayPort are better options. HDMI came from the TV industry and royalty-free DisplayPort from the PC industry. In both cases, the version level can be important.With HDMI, even version 1.4 – from 2009 – can handle 1440p at 60Hz, which should be enough for your purposes. But it would be better to for look for v2.0 from 2013, if not last year’s v2.1.With DisplayPort, look for version 1.2 (from 2010) or later. The spec is now up to v1.4, but even the first version (from 2006) supported both Full HD and Quad HD screens at 60Hz.Monitor manufacturers offer all kinds of features to make products more attractive to some users. Examples include curved screens, built-in speakers, built-in TV decoders, USB ports, and so on. Most of them also increase the price, so don’t buy them if you don’t need them.Some people prefer monitors with stands that let you raise, lower or tilt the screen easily. There’s also the time-honoured workaround of standing the monitor on a couple of books.Nvida’s G-Sync and AMD’s Freesync are “adaptive sync technologies” built into some monitors. They make sure your graphics card and monitor refresh at the same time, which can reduce input lag and “screen tearing” (where parts of the image don’t line up correctly). These features are aimed at gamers, but if they don’t cost extra, there’s no harm in having them.

Jungle rivers are ripped open into a delta of sand dunes and stagnant, discoloured ponds. Ant-sized bulldozers roll down mud paths on the soggy moonscape dotted with glinting corrugated iron rooftops.Amid the roar of the propellers, Cesar Ascorra eagerly points to a cluster of newly planted saplings in the sand. They are evenly spaced, like a polka dot pattern, but the area they cover is dwarfed by the swathe of destruction carved by illegal gold miners.“It’s a start,” says Ascorra. “We’ve reforested 42 hectares (104 acres) of land deforested by illegal gold mining,” he says.But the damage goes beyond felling trees. Around 180 tonnes of mercury are dumped every year into the rivers, lakes and soils of the bioersity hotspot which was visited by Pope Francis in January, according to studies by Peru’s Artisanal Gold Council.As part of the reforestation experiment, scientists are trying out tree species which can survive in the sand left behind by mining. They are also using bio-char compost, made from locally grown Brazil nut shells, to block the absorption of mercury from the soil into the trees and to regenerate the topsoil.Among the saplings planted is the mighty shihuahuaco which could grow to be one of the tallest trees in the forest and is the preferred nesting place for the rare harpy eagle.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theMiles Silman, head of the Wake Forest Centre for Energy, Environment and Sustainability which partners with CINCIA, says these are by far the largest trials of restoration on mined lands in the lowland tropics.The practice is not confined to Peru but is common in the forests of Brazil, Colombia and increasingly Venezuela, driven by its economic crisis.“Mining is about as destructive a land use as you could think of short of nuclear annihilation,” he tells the . “But, there are trajectories where it is a tragedy, full stop, and there are trajectories where you are left with a landscape that can heal for future uses.”At this experimental stage, the scientists are “looking at methods and technologies to address the problem at scale,” he explains. The next step, he says, is to work with the miners and communities to “implement them at scale”.The gold fever, which exploded after the 2008 global economic crisis and the metal’s vertiginous price rise, has brought tens of thousands of fortune-seeking migrants to the jungle from poor Andean regions nearby.While the use of mercury is cavalier and commonplace, some miners have been persuaded to try out new machinery which uses gravity separation and bypasses the use of the toxic heavy metal to bind with the gold.The mining corridor stretches like a festering wound along the basin of the Madre de Dios river, and has spread to other rivers. But there are still provinces untouched by mining, such as Tahuamanu, at the intersection of Peru, Bolivia and Brazil, which has become a model for sustainable forestry.“The way to go forward has to do with science and technology,” says Kurt Holle, the new director of WWF Peru who for two decades ran Rainforest Expeditions, an eco-tourism business in Madre de Dios.“You have to form citizens who want to do, rather than have to do, what is right for nature,” he says, citing his experience in engaging an indigenous community in nature tourism and creating a natural buffer against mining.Mining’s get-rich-quick appeal makes its spread seem inexorable, but some local people are fighting to secure their region’s long term survival.“We bring the science closer to the people to help them solve everyday problems,” says Ascorra.“There’s still a lot of green and the green is hope.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

He has met and corresponded with Donald Trump, leading the US president to declare last month that the two leaders had “fallen in love”.During a summit between North and South Korea last month, Kim told Hyginus Kim Hee-joong, a South Korean archbishop, that he wanted the pope to know of his desire for peace.North Korea this year topped a list of 50 countries ranked for the persecution of Christians for the 16th year in a row. The list, compiled by the Christian watchdog Open Doors, highlighted the imprisonment in labour camps of Christians and Christian missionaries in the state.It said: “Due to constant indoctrination, neighbours and family members, including children, are highly watchful and report anything suspicious to the authorities. If Christians are discovered, they are deported to labour camps as political criminals or killed on the spot their families share their fate.“Meeting for worship is almost impossible, so is done in utmost secrecy. The churches shown to visitors in Pyongyang serve mere propaganda purposes.”“The regime exerts absolute influence over the handful of state-controlled houses of worship permitted to exist, creating a facade of religious life in North Korea. In practice, the North Korean regime treats religion as a threat, particularly faiths associated with the West, such as Christianity, and is known to arrest, torture, imprison, and even execute religious believers.According to Open Doors, there are an estimated 300,000 Christians in a population of 25.4 million, and 50-75,000 Christians in the country’s labour camps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/feff83b2abc9de13f1625dd7396639e5271c0181/0_0_5130_3079/master/5130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa3f0eec308e070b005cef3f222161b5","title":"search for khashoggis remains extends to saudi consul generals residence","story":"Turkish police sweep Mohammad al-Otaibi’s home and consular vehiclesFloodlights and a drone have been deployed in the search of the Saudi consul general’s residence in Istanbul after Turkish investigators were finally allowed access to the property, where it is believed a Saudi hit squad sent to silence the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi disposed of his remains. The forensics team left the premises early on Thursday after conducting a nine hour sweep of the residence and consular vehicles. The consulate itself was also searched for a second time. Of particular focus to investigators appeared to be the garage below the consul general’s home, and parts of the property’s garden were dug up.It was not immediately clear what the search unearthed, although investigators took several boxes and bags with them. The Turkish interior ministry promised the results would be “shared with the world”.On Thursday the Turkish pro-government newspaper Sabah published pictures taken from surveillance video outside the consulate which it said identified a man thought to be a member of the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman’s security staff entering the building on the morning of 2 October, the day Khashoggi vanished.In the video, the suspect is seen arriving with several other men at 9.55am. Khashoggi arrived for an appointment at 1.14pm.Sabah also published stills from videos that day showing the same man outside the consul general’s home and, later, checking out of a nearby hotel. The stills match the profile of one of the 15 Saudi nationals who were photographed two weeks ago at Istanbul’s Atatürk airport. Turkish officials believe that the 15-person team was behind the alleged murder inside the diplomatic mission.A previous search of the consulate building on Monday night revealed “toxic substances” and freshly painted surfaces, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told reporters.The consul general, Mohammad al-Otaibi, left the country with his family for Riyadh on Tuesday, after it was announced that his residence would become part of the criminal investigation.Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who left Saudi Arabia for the US in self-imposed exile last year, has not been seen since he visited the consulate on 2 October to pick up paperwork for his planned marriage.Over the past two weeks Turkish officials have leaked increasingly shocking evidence that they say proves that the journalist, who was critical of the Saudi crown prince, was tortured and killed inside the building and his dismembered body was driven to the nearby consul general’s house where it was disposed of.Turkish and US media published details from a three-minute audio recording on Wednesday that Turkish officials described as proof that Khashoggi had his fingers severed during an interrogation. His killers then allegedly beheaded him and cut up his body with a bone saw brought by a forensics specialist who travelled with the assassination team.On the tape, the alleged doctor can be heard explaining that he likes to listen to music while he works, and encouraging others in the room to put headphones on.Riyadh has denied the allegations, despite reports in the US media that the kingdom was considering acknowledging that Khashoggi may have died in a botched rendition operation.Jamal Khashoggi is one of the Arab world’s most prominent journalists and commentators. He is an outspoken critic of\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia\u0026nbspwho has dared to defy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler.While living in Saudi Arabia, Khashoggi was told to stop writing or posting on Twitter, where he has more than 1.6 million followers. He moved to the US more than a year ago, where he continued to comment on his country both in print and on television. He wrote columns for the Washington Post and\u0026nbspthe .His message struck a nuanced tone in the US, where he tried to acknowledge the reforms undertaken by Bin Salman while also highlighting the flaws.Khashoggi previously had close links with the Saudi royal family, including having served as a media aide to Prince Turki al-Faisal, when the latter was director general of the Saudi intelligence agency.He is also a former editor of the Saudi newspaper al-Watan and had worked with Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a grandson of the first Saudi king who was detained last year as part of what the authorities said was an anti-corruption campaign.On Thursday, the UK’s international trade secretary, Liam Fox, and the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, joined a growing list of government ministers and prominent business executives cancelling their attendance at a Saudi Arabia investment conference.Both the UK and France enjoy close diplomatic ties and commercial relations with Riyadh ning energy, finance and arms. The UK’s Department for International Trade said the “time is not right” for Fox to go to the Future Investment Initiative on 23 October. Le Maire said his absence would not jeopardise French relations with the Saudis. Despite the growing body of evidence and a tide of international condemnation over the alleged murder, the House of Saud’s friends in the Trump administration have stood firmly by their most important Arab ally.Donald Trump has suggested on several occasions that he believes the denials of responsibility from King Salman and Mohammed bin Salman, speculating without providing evidence that “rogue killers” could be to blame.On Wednesday night the president said the US had asked Turkey to share the audio recording. He is waiting to be briefed on Thursday by his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, whom he dispatched to Riyadh and Ankara this week in search of answers over Khashoggi’s disappearance.

Video: Simon Carswell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHaulier Stephen Heasley  at Manfreight  in Portadown, Co Armagh. Photograph: Liam McBurney for The Stephen Heasley carries out a few final checks at the back of the lorry to make sure the load is secure.As a cold mist drifts down over him from the minus-22-degree air inside, he pulls at a metal bar that will keep the 20-plus tonnes of frozen chicken in his refrigerated lorry in place for the 620km journey – lasting 12 bumpy hours – to the east midlands of England.The chicken has come from a processing plant in Dungannon, Co Tyrone and before that from Northern Irish farms. Our destination is a cold-storage facility outside Grantham in Lincolnshire. Grantham is probably best known as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, but it’s also one of the locations where Northern Irish chickens are dismembered, sent for repackaging and distributed to supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Aldi across the United Kingdom and Ireland.It is another type of dismembering that Heasley and other hauliers fear most: the chopping-up of delicately balanced supply chains. These ensure that animals reared in one island and processed in another can be prepared for customers across both jurisdictions, guaranteeing that products maintain the commercially viable shelf life of five to six days that keeps supplies flowing and money changing hands.The UK voted to leave the European Union 28 months ago and yet, with less than six months to go to “Brexit Day” (the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm British time on Friday, March 29th, 2019), British and European politicians have not agreed an exit deal. Such a deal would protect those supply chains while both sides hammer out a longer-term agreement governing future trading between the world’s second-largest economic bloc and its fifth-largest economy.Heasley – a 43-year-old from Lisburn, Co Antrim – knows the road ahead better than most. He has made the journey from Portadown, Co Armagh, across the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland Border and on to Dublin Port, Holyhead and then England many, many times in his two-decade career driving lorries.“Watch yourself, there’s a bump coming up,” he says, pointing into the distance to a ridge you still can’t see, minutes after we have pulled out of the haulage yard of Manfreight, the Portadown company he works for.You tend to feel most things on the road in a 44-tonne, 500-horsepower Volvo FH4 lorry, particularly with a load of between £40,000 (€46,000) and £60,000 (€68,000) worth of frozen chickens in the back.Heasley and hauliers like him feel Brexit more keenly than most of us, but they know too that the political road ahead is difficult to navigate.Transport companies such as Manfreight have developed decades-long supply routes, carefully managed on delicate profit margins and strictly regulated man-hours for the company’s 180 drivers. For these businesses, which rely on certainty, Brexit is chaos. Nobody knows what will happen, and planning ahead is complex.“There is nothing an average man or company can do because they don’t know what is going to happen,” says Heasley, 11 kilometres from what is right now an invisible border.“They don’t know what they can do. They just don’t want delays.”From Portadown, it is about 140km to Dublin Port. Heasley knows he can make the 8.40pm Stena Line to Holyhead in plenty of time. There is little traffic on the road this Wednesday evening.Less than an hour into our journey, as we approach the Border, the Volvo truck is powering ahead steadily at 56mph, or 90kmh. Suddenly, the continuous white line on the side of the road becomes a broken yellow one, and roadside signs turn bilingual, in Irish and English. Speeds and distances now appear in kilometres rather than miles. These are the only indicators that we have crossed the Border at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.“Other than that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” says Heasley.Brexit has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over this border road and the rest of the 499km frontier from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.While the EU and UK have said they want to avoid a hard border post-Brexit, they still have not agreed a plan to achieve this. Both have agreed that within the treaty covering the UK’s exit from the EU there must be a “backstop” – a guarantee to have no hard border unless and until a future trade deal offers a better solution to avoid one – but no backstop has been agreed.It has become the most intractable part of the Brexit negotiations, threatening to scupper an overall exit deal and heightening the pressure on EU and UK negotiators to agree some compromise for this week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels.“Nobody is actually sure what’s going to happen with the Border,” says Heasley, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We’re hoping for transport companies’ sake and the customers’ sake that there are no border crossing checks and no security, because it will have an impact on us as drivers and the loads we are carrying.”He explains that under EU rules heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers must have a 11-hour rest every day, though it can be reduced to nine hours, three times a week. That means from the moment a driver starts driving, they have a 15-hour period – a “spread-over,” Heasley calls it – to get their goods to a destination.And there are plenty of goods heading to destinations on these roads. The Revenue Commissioners estimates that 13,000 commercial vehicles cross the Border every day. The UK’s Freight Transport Association has warned that a bad or no-deal Brexit could lead to “near-paralysis of freight” at the Border.Some Northern Irish hauliers have tried to Brexit-proof their businesses. Manfreight has opened an office in Clonshaugh, north of Dublin. Others are unwilling to invest without knowing what Brexit will likely bring.“It is that lack of clarity, people are unwilling to take a gamble,” says Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Driving across the Border, we have about an hour and a half to make the 8.40pm ferry. If we miss that boat, the next one from Dublin Port to Holyhead is at 2.15am. This would mean pulling out of the port at Holyhead on the other side of the Irish Sea at around 6.15am. With more than four hours driving still to go to reach Grantham – and with Heasley’s 15-hour spread-over expiring at 9am – he would not get there in time.“That is what a driver is up against,” he says. “If I was out of time, they would have to find another driver to lift that food. It might not be our man it might be a subbie. You have all that additional cost either way.”The margin of error is extremely narrow. Any kind of delay on the Irish Border after Brexit could knock a tight schedule for a haulier like Heasley out.“The boat waits for no man. It is not interested because some customs man kept me for an hour or two up the road,” he says.Heasley’s colleague Henry Totten, a 75-year-old who has been driving since he was 21, knows about delays at the Border better than most from his days transporting goods north and south at the height of the Troubles. Checks on the goods he was hauling had to be carried out by customs agents on either side of the Border, in both Newry and Dundalk, and then at the Border itself, adding up to five hours to a journey time.“You were wasting half a day no matter what way you looked at it,” he says.Carrying “groupage” – a mix of goods collected from different customers to create an economic full-load – made customs checks even more complicated, he recalls.“You could have sat there all day. The customs official could have said, ‘I want to see such and such an article,’ and you would have to take half the load off to get to it,” says Totten.Now he can complete a run from Northern Ireland to Cork and back in a single day.“It is the best thing since penicillin,” says Totten of the invisible border that has been in place for more than 20 years. “You have no stops to do.”We make good time to Dublin. There was just a two-minute slow-down at an M1 toll booth north of Dublin city and some light traffic heading into Dublin Port.Heasley drives into the holding lorry park at the port with 28 minutes to spare before the ferry leaves.The port is Ireland’s busiest for freight by some distance. Central Statistics Office figures show that 992,295 loaded freight vehicles and trailers passed through the port in 2017. It is a key transit point to access the UK from Ireland and over the so-called UK “land-bridge” to continental Europe.The Freight Transport Association estimates that 60 per cent of the 475,000 freight containers shipped to Britain have their final destination in Britain and that most of the remainder ends up being transported on to other parts of the EU.Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said on a visit to Dublin this week that some 70 per cent of goods moving between Ireland and Britain pass through Holyhead and Pembroke Dock, the other Welsh port for freight transportation. “Any kind of delay is bad. It is not just bad in terms of being able to export from Ireland into Great Britain, but onward traffic going through Dover into the continent. This point has been made to me by Irish haulage companies,” Jones says.Any collapse in Brexit talks could hurt Ireland’s trade with the UK and the rest of the EU. There is lots at stake: Ireland exported €14.8 billion of goods to the UK in 2016 – 12.5 per cent of all the country’s exports, while it imported €20.5 billion – 28 per cent of all imports coming into the country, according to the Central Statistics Office.As Heasley drives his lorry into the port, an official tells him that all the “plug-ins” on the boat have been taken. This means he cannot plug into an electricity mains to keep his refrigerator running. Trucks are prohibited from running their own engines for the duration of the roughly 3½-hour sailing to Wales.Heasley’s chickens are frozen so it is not a problem on this trip, but if he was carrying fresh “just-in-time” products such as dairy items – yoghurts, ice cream and the like – or “something that is a bit vulnerable”, he would need a plug-in. Otherwise, “a lollipop would run off a stick,” he says.At the check-in hut at the port, Heasley discovers he is not booked onto the ferry. There has been a mix-up. He makes a phone call back to Manfreight and, a few minutes later, Heasley has our tickets in his hand.Eighteen minutes after arriving at the port – and with no checks of his goods on board – he drives onto the ferry at 8.30pm, the third-last lorry onto the boat with 10 minutes to spare before departure.Upstairs, we tuck into a meal of meatballs and chips in the Truckers’ Restaurant, surrounded by grey-looking drivers dressed in checked shirts, combat T-shirts and baseball caps.Heasley says that some of the chicken we are transporting will end up being served in fast-food restaurants back in Ireland after being processed and breaded in another factory before being distributed to customers. This is how circular supply chains work in Britain and Ireland. The economies are more closely intertwined than many consumers realise.He explains the meticulous choreography of supply chains: hauliers often have a set time to deliver food produce to a distribution centre in time for other lorries to transport it on to other processing centres.Brexit and border hold-ups could mean missing a crucial delivery window, landing additional costs on the haulier. Regular delays might even lead to the loss of contracts to suppliers operating closer to the distribution centre. It is all about maintaining the critical shelf life of products. Fail to do so, and costs could increase and availability of products could fall.“Down the line, everybody will pay for it,” says Heasley. “It is going to have an impact across the board.”A day before our journey, Heasley’s boss, Chris Slowey, Manfreight’s owner, explains that drivers are the biggest commodity in the haulage business, and a driver being delayed for one 24-hour cycle a week because of Brexit would mean a requirement for 20 per cent more drivers when there are shortages of drivers generally.“If each driver of ours loses a day, it would effectively mean we would have to renegotiate all our rates with our customers,” he says, explaining the havoc Brexit could cause freight operators.“From an exam to a marriage, you have a period of preparation because you know what is coming. With Brexit there are so many unknowns,” he says.On the ferry over dinner, Heasley explains other challenges lorry drivers face on the road: diesel stolen from tanks while drivers sleep in their cabs “curtain sider” lorries being knifed open and goods stolen toilet emergencies.An unintended consequence of Brexit-related delays at borders could lead to a boom in sales of Lucozade and Oasis drinks bottles, both popular with lorry drivers who have to answer the call of nature on the road. “They have a wider neck,” Heasley explains. He makes clear this is not something he resorts to himself.Four hours after driving onto the ferry in Dublin, Heasley drives down the ramp at Holyhead. Apart from a short delay as a result of congestion from hundreds of trucks disembarking from two ferries arriving at the same time in Wales, we are out of the port within 13 minutes. Only one piece of paperwork is handed in to a port official.“Everything’s smooth. Everything’s all right,” says Heasley as he heads for the dual-carriageway and the M56 to take us to the M6, the motorway spine running down the west of England from the Scottish border.Heasley explains that the majority of Manfreight’s traffic goes “over the top” via ports at Larne and Cairnryan, through Scotland and down into England. This route makes sense for deliveries in the north of England because there is less driving time required, but a lower speed limit in Scotland is a big downside.The strict limits on driving times determines everything, however.“Going through Dublin tends to be easier,” says Heasley. “If a man’s going to the south of England, it just means it brings you out in the middle of England so you have less driving time.”Barrelling down near-empty roads as we cross into England, Heasley says he was not among the 56 per cent of Northern Irish voters who elected to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. He voted Leave along with other “lorry men” because of strict EU rules on drivers and their hours, and the heavy fixed penalties that enforce them.The damage he saw to lorries at Calais port in France during the migrant crisis also encouraged him to vote Leave. Information shared on lorry driver groups on Facebook about what was happening to the lorries and drivers helped to sway his vote, he says.“People never knew when they voted what the impact of Brexit was going to be,” he says.He points to the British morning TV interview with Brexiteer Nigel Farage the day after the referendum, when Farage admitted that the Leave campaign misled the public about EU money going to the health service post-Brexit.Does he regret voting to leave now?“Aye,” says Heasley. “I believe Brexit is going to impact on our cost of living, so I do. It is going to be more expensive for a man to run a haulage company now than it was previously. People don’t understand that. I never understood that at the time.”And if he had the opportunity to vote again? “I wouldn’t have voted Leave,” he says.As Heasley explains the challenges around the EU regulations, he grimaces – and it has nothing to do with the regulations. “That’s a rabbit I just killed there,” he says.Our early-morning discussion turns to roadkill, the perils of speeding, his advice for trainee drivers and his favourite route (dawn on the West Pennines, he says).“I killed a deer one time on the A75 in Scotland . . . bigger than a dog,” he says.Heasley pulls into a services stop near Crewe in England, still almost two hours from our destination in Grantham. He has hit his four-hour driving limit so, under EU regulations, he has to take a 45-minute break.Inside, we grab a tea and coffee and some chocolate. Heasley explains the dietary toll and the poor physical shape this gruelling work life leaves some lorry men in. Heasley sometimes likes to walk up and down factory yards for exercise after “tipping” his loads.After Heasley’s compulsory 45-minute rest-up and a quick check that the temperature around the chickens is still well below freezing, we are back on the road.Still in darkness, Heasley navigates a final dangerous junction, waiting a few minutes for a safe gap to cross two lanes of fast-moving oncoming traffic. The morning commuters are on the road. A little after 6am, we pull in to our destination: the cold store in Grantham.Heasley exchanges paperwork at a check-in hut and pulls around the back. He opens the back door for the first time since Portadown and reverses the six-axle lorry slowly up to a hatch for the chickens to be unloaded.It is completed in 19 minutes, leaving him with more than two hours still to go within his driving limit. That is enough time to head north and make his next collection point for his return back to Portadown “over the top” via Scotland.“Smooth and no delays,” he says of the 12-hour, 22-minute door-to-door trip.Brexit will likely make this journey rougher, he acknowledges, given the potential for delays at the Irish Border or at Holyhead once the UK is no longer in the the EU.“Come March it is a different story, all uncertain,” he says, before starting the next leg of his journey.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Toby MelvilleReutersEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said that he was sure EU leaders would respond positively to any request from Britain for a longer transition period after Brexit. Speaking to reporters after a summit on Thursday, Tusk said the issue of lengthening the transition from 21 months had not been discussed by leaders but noted that British Prime Minister Theresa May had originally spoken of a transition of about two years. Earlier, May said she was open to extending the transition by a few months.While EU Governments understand the challenges Mrs May faces in her party and parliament, senior sources say that the EU cannot have its red lines defined by Mrs May’s domestic difficulties.The German chancellor Angela Merkel is reported to have told a dinner at the three-day European Council summit last night that just because Mrs May faced problems at home, it was not a reason for the EU to amend its negotiating position.A senior Irish source said: “We can’t get involved in the nitty-gritty of British politics.”Although EU officials said that the leaders did not discuss the position in London at last night’s dinner, The  understands that the subject was broached by some of the leaders present. One source said there was sympathy for May but also concern about her ability to make agreement made in Brussels stick in London.During the transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 it will continue to operate under European Union trading rules. The transition will only be in place in the event of a withdrawal agreement being in place. The so-called backstop arrangement which commits to the maintaining of an open Border in Ireland, would come into effect in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Mrs May initially suggested an “implementation period” of around two years after Brexit, to give the UK’s authorities and companies time to prepare for new arrangements, but later accepted a 21-month transition ending on the last day of 2020. It emerged on Wednesday that EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is ready to discuss a further year’s extension to allow time to find a solution to keep the Irish Border open. Leaders of the 27 remaining EU states ditched proposals for a special Brexit summit in November, after Mr Barnier told them he needed “much more time” to find a way to avoid a hard Border in Ireland. This week’s summit had been billed as “the moment of truth” when agreement is needed to allow time for ratification in the Westminster and European parliaments. But Mrs May has not come forward with the new “concrete proposals” demanded by European Council president Donald Tusk, instead telling fellow leaders that “courage, trust and leadership” are needed on both sides to find a solution. The prospect of an extra year of transition is widely expected to form part of any eventual deal, if one is reached over the coming weeks. Although she says she does not expect an extension will be needed, Mrs May will face fire from Brexiteers in London on the issue, which they see as a further indication of British concessions to the EU.Arch-Brexiteer in Mrs May’s Tory Party, Jacob Rees-Mogg, dismissed the idea of an extension of the transition period as “a rather poor attempt at kicking the can down the road”. Mr Rees-Mogg said it risked “very substantial costs” for the UK, which would have to make additional contributions running into billions of pounds into EU budgets and would almost certainly lose its current rebate. An extended transition period “means we are in the EU for longer when the EU can make rules for the UK over which we would have no say and we would be paying for the privilege”, the North East Somerset MP told Sky News. “The government doesn’t have endless money. It has to make choices. The question the Government has to answer is if this costs billions of pounds, is it better to give the money to the EU or better to sort out the issues with Universal Credit?”Former UK foreign secretary Boris Johnson and Mr Rees-Mogg joined the former Brexit secretary David Davis and three other former ministers in signing an open letter warning the British prime minister not to “bind the UK into the purgatory of perpetual membership of the EU’s customs union”. The group called on Mrs May to “reset” the negotiations and ditch her Chequers Brexit blueprint in favour of a Canada-style free trade agreement.“We are close to the moment of truth. Brexit offers the prize of a better future, global free trade deals and political independence,” said the letter. “But if these potential gains are sacrificed because of EU bullying and the Government’s desperation to secure a deal, the British people will not forgive us.”Mrs May initially suggested an “implementation period” of around two years after Brexit, to give the UK’s authorities and companies time to prepare for new arrangements, but later accepted a 21-month transition ending on the last day of 2020.It emerged on Wednesday that EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is ready to discuss a further year’s extension to allow time to find a solution to keep the Irish Border open.Meanwhile, the British Irish Chamber of Commerce warned of “alarming risks” to business and trade from the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. The chamber’s director general John McGrane said the impasse in negotiations was “deeply disconcerting” and had left companies in “an impossible place” to invest and plan “because they still don’t know what will happen” and that they may have to prepare for a hard Brexit. “The last few months we have seen a significantly greater appreciation that there is a risk of a no-deal outcome. Lots of people who wouldn’t have conceived that, or who were blindly optimistic, are thinking they could be wrong. It would be catastrophic for many impacted by it,” Mr McGrane said He said it was “encouraging” that a two-part proposition - an extension of the standstill post-Brexit transition period and the two-tier backstop solution to avoid a hard Irish border - could lead to a EU-UK deal, but there would have to be much work on “word-crafting” in the run-up to the next scheduled summit of EU leaders in December.“We don’t have a form of words in any of the proposition that would enable a withdrawal agreement to be signed. That is leaving us with the no-deal potential looming with Brexit just months away,” he said. - Additional reporting PA, Reuters Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand AFPGettyOn her way into the European Council building this morning, Theresa May told reporters that she was considering an extension of the post-Brexit transition beyond the end of 2020. But she played down its significance, suggesting that it was just another idea about how to resolve the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop.“A further idea that has emerged - and it is an idea at this stage - is to create an option to extend the implementation period for a matter of months - and it would only be for a matter of months. But the point is that this is not expected to be used, because we are working to ensure that we have that future relationship in place by the end of December 2020,” she said.The prime minister may have won some indulgence from the EU leaders by sounding open to new ideas but the proposal for an extended transition has alarmed her Brexiteer backbenchers. Part of the problem was that Downing Street chose not to roll the pitch in advance of the news that May was considering it, which European Parliament president Antonio Tajani blurted out in Brussels last night.Jacob Rees-Mogg warned this morning that an extra year in transition after Brexit would leave Britain as a “vassal state” for another 12 months, following rules set in Brussels and paying into the EU budget. The prime minister and her allies insist that an extension of the transition would only last a few months and would probably not be invoked in any case. But after so many compromises May said she would never contemplate and then accepted soon afterwards, the Brexiteers are sceptical about her latest assurances.At the end of her 15-minute statement to EU leaders on Wednesday night, May said that the last stage of the Brexit negotiations required “courage, trust and leadership”. It’s never too late to show courage or leadership but the prime minister may have run out of time to win back the trust she has lost in Brussels and at Westminster.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Ms May’s problem is that, with so little political room for manoeuvre at home, any sign of a concession to the EU  could trigger a cabinet revolt. Photograph: Jasper JuinenBloombergAs Theresa May faced the other 27 EU leaders for the first time since last month’s rancorous encounter at Salzburg, she was at pains to stress the progress that had been made over the past year. She pointed to last December’s joint report, which agreed to put a backstop in place to guarantee no hard border in Ireland as an example of the two sides’ capacity to find agreement under inauspicious circumstances.In her bilateral meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and again when she addressed the 27 leaders, May restated her commitment to a “legally operable” backstop. This was not a concession but it was an assurance that Britain is not seeking to resile from the commitments it made last December and in March.In March, the prime minister agreed that the backstop would remain in place “unless and until” a permanent solution is found to keep the Border open. Last night in Brussels, she and the Taoiseach agreed that such a permanent solution should be found in the future economic relationship between Britain and the EU.After the debacle at Salzburg and the failure of negotiators to reach agreement on a withdrawal agreement this week, it was important for the prime minister to persuade the other leaders that she is serious about finding a solution to the impasse over the backstop. Last night, she asked for their help in finding a creative solution to the “dilemma” of the backstop.But European Parliament president Antonio Tajani said the prime minister had offered nothing new in her 15-minute address to the ministers. May’s problem is that, with so little political room for manoeuvre at home, any sign of a concession to the EU 27 could trigger a cabinet revolt.Downing Street responded gingerly to the suggestion by Michel Barnier and other EU politicians, including minister for foreign affairs Simon Coveney, that the post-Brexit transition period could be extended. Such an extension would give Britain more time to negotiate a trade and customs deal with the EU and make it less likely that there would be any gap that would require a backstop to come into operation.But for Conservative Brexiteers already disillusioned by the slow place of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, the prospect of following EU rules and sending money to Brussels for another year could be too much to bear.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

He also released a secret recording of a phone discussion he had with Mr Bridges in which they discussed the Chinese businessman\u0027s hopes that the donation would help to secure a second Chinese National party MP.According to Mr Ross, Mr Bridges received the donation from Zhang Yikun, a prominent Chinese community leader who moved to New Zealand in 2000, following a dinner at the businessman’s home and a subsequent fundraising event. Mr Bridges allegedly then instructed that Mr Ross split the donation into smaller amounts to ensure that Mr Zhang was not declared as the source.Mr Zhang, who served in the Chinese military, has close links to MPs and local politicians in various parties and received an Order of Merit as part of this year’s Queen’s Birthday Honours. He has been involved in numerous trade and political delegations to and from China and promoted China’s massive Belt and Road Initiative – a global infrastructure, trade and investment program to which New Zealand has signed up.New Zealand\u0026#39s opposition leader Simon Bridges talks to reporters at Parliament in Wellington on WednesdayThe claims have fuelled concerns about China’s growing efforts to influence affairs in the Pacific and beyond. New Zealand and Australia have expressed reservations about China’s growing loans program in the South Pacific and its alleged attempts to try to set up a military base in the region.Professor Anne-Marie Brady, a China expert at the University of Canterbury  who has written extensively about China’s efforts to interfere in New Zealand’s affairs, linked Mr Zhang to the United Front Work Department, a  government department which promotes the Communist Party’s interests and values abroad.“The most concerning aspect to the controversy over National\u0027s hidden donations is that the source of the funds is a leader in #CCP united front work activities,” Professor Brady said in a tweet.The claims have sent shockwaves through New Zealand’s politics and cast doubt about Mr Bridges’ political future. The National party ruled for almost a decade before a dismal  result last year led to Labour’s Jacinda Ardern becoming prime minister.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern holds her baby after speaking at the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit during the 73rd United Nations General Assembly in New YorkMr Zhang and Mr Bridges have both denied any wrongdoing.“Jami-Lee Ross is a person who lies and leaks and, in this conversation, he deliberately tried to set me up,” Mr Bridges said. “The reality is I believe Jami-Lee Ross has been secretly taping me for many, many months.”But Mr Ross, who is married with children, was embroiled in his own scandal after two women claimed they were manipulated by him during extra-marital affairs, and two others accused him of bullying and misconduct. Mr Ross had insisted the claims were an attempt to smear him, but his denials helped to prompt the women to come forward.“I watched as Jami-Lee Ross looked reporters in the eye and told the nation that he, ‘to the best of his knowledge, had never harassed a woman’,” a woman told the Newsroom website.“He was calm. He was collected. He was every bit the master of deception.”Brexit latest: Donald Tusk warns \u0026#39not enough progress made\u0026#39 on backstop- live news updatesPolice officers who Tasered Dalian Atkinson before he died could face criminal charges as file passed to prosecutorsTyphoons \u0026#39trick\u0026#39 Japan\u0026#39s cherry trees into blooming months earlyComment: Chucking Chequers is not enough, it’s time the Tories chucked Mrs MayBaby injured as shots fired through house window in BirminghamSex with an ex-partner might actually be good for you, study findsSave the Children handed role in Government crackdown on abuse inBritish woman arrested for murder after her expat husband is stabbed to death with kitchen knife in MalaysiaKanye West hands out Yeezys to orphans and leaders alike in UgandaPutin says Crimean school shooting result of \u0026#39globalisation\u0026#39Aid to 11 million at risk as Pakistani intelligence gives 18 charities and NGOs their marching ordersSenior figure in Germany\u0026#39s AfD \u0026#39went on pilgrimage to Hitler sites\u0026#39Key Afghan police chief killed in shooting at governor\u0026#39s compound after meeting with US generalWrong-way M40 crash car had been in a collision five days earlier, police revealLiam Fox pulls out of \u0026#39Davos in the Desert\u0026#39 summit in Saudi Arabia over Jamal Khashoggi allegationsMarriage to Victoria Beckham can be complicated, says her husband DavidStories, National Theatre, review: a sperm-donor drama with plenty of laughs, but not enough heartReality star tells court her collagen lip implants prevented her from blowing into breathalyser How Merkel and Macron spent more time in the pub than listening to May\u0026#39s Brexit overturesRomans to hold mass sit-in to protest at the sorry state of the Eternal CityWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/02/27/TELEMMGLPICT000155770454_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"liam fox pulls davos desert jamal khashoggi allegations","story":"Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is one of the last Western officials scheduled to attend Liam Fox, the international trade secretary,  has pulled out of next week’s “Davos in the Desert” summit in Riyadh amid allegations that Saudi Arabia murdered Jamal Khashoggi, the missing journalist. Dr Fox\u0027s withdrawal leaves Steve Mnuchen, the US treasury secretary, as one of the last Western officials still scheduled to attend the conference after wave of cancellations. A UK government spokesman said: The Secretary of State for International Trade has decided the time is not right for him to attend the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh on 23 October.“The UK remains very concerned about Jamal Khashoggi’s disappearance.“We encourage Turkish-Saudi collaboration and look forward to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia conducting a thorough, credible, transparent, and prompt investigation, as announced. Those bearing responsibility for his disappearance must be held to account.”Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, also said Thursday he would no longer be attending. “I will not be going,” he said. “The allegations are serious”. He was followed shortly after by Wopke Hoekstra, the Dutch finance minister. New images showed Maher Mutreb, a Saudi intelligence officer, outside the consulate several hours before Mr Khashoggi arrivedMr Mnuchen will make a final decision on Friday, according to the White House, but for now is scheduled to the summit, formally known as the Future Investment Summit. Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, and a number of high-profile business executives have all backed out of the conference.  New images showed Maher Mutreb, a Saudi intelligence officer formally based at the Saudi embassy in London, outside the consulate several hours before Mr Khashoggi arrived. Mr Mutreb appears to be part of the personal entourage of Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, and has traveled with him several times. Meanwhile, Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, is due to brief Donald Trump, the US president, this afternoon on his findings from a two-day trip to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Mike Pompeo spent two days in Saudi Arabia and TurkeyTurkish officials say a team of 15 Saudi operatives murdered Mr Khashoggi and dismembered his body inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. They claim to have graphic audio tape, which captures one Saudi operative urging others to listen to music as they carved up Mr Khashoggi’s body with a bone saw. One Turkish report said the Saudis cut off Mr Khashoggi’s fingers before beheading him.Saudi Arabia has vehemently denied responsibility although some reports indicate the Saudi royal family is preparing to blame intelligence officials for the killing in an effort to protect Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince.Turkey has not shared the alleged audio tapes with Western intelligence agencies, according to Reuters. Turkish crime scene investigators left the Saudi consulate early on Thursday after searching the building and consular vehicles. They used bright lights to illuminate the garden.Earlier, the investigators spent nearly nine hours in the Saudi consul\u0027s residence, as did Saudi investigators. The Turkish team\u0027s search included the roof and garage and the use of a drone.The Washington Post published Mr Khashoggi’s final column on Wednesday, where he writes that “Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate, in a piece that apparently foreshadowed his own fate.In a note published with the column, Karen Attiah, global opinions editor at The Washington Post, said the piece  perfectly captured Khashoggi’s commitment to freedom in the Arab world: A freedom he apparently gave his life for.She said she received it from his assistant a day after he disappeared.“The Post held off publishing it because we hoped Jamal would come back to us so that he and I could edit it together,” she wrote.“Now I have to accept: That is not going to happen. This is the last piece of his I will edit for The Post.”Daniel Ortega unleashes Orwellian repression as Nicaragua accused of torturing protestersBrexit latest: Donald Tusk warns \u0026#39not enough progress made\u0026#39 on backstop- live news updatesPolice officers who Tasered Dalian Atkinson before he died could face criminal charges as file passed to prosecutorsChinese tycoon accused of trying to buy seats in New Zealand parliament as opposition crisis deepensTyphoons \u0026#39trick\u0026#39 Japan\u0026#39s cherry trees into blooming months earlyComment: Chucking Chequers is not enough, it’s time the Tories chucked Mrs MayBaby injured as shots fired through house window in BirminghamSex with an ex-partner might actually be good for you, study findsSave the Children handed role in Government crackdown on abuse inBritish woman arrested for murder after her expat husband is stabbed to death with kitchen knife in MalaysiaKanye West hands out Yeezys to orphans and leaders alike in UgandaPutin says Crimean school shooting result of \u0026#39globalisation\u0026#39Aid to 11 million at risk as Pakistani intelligence gives 18 charities and NGOs their marching ordersSenior figure in Germany\u0026#39s AfD \u0026#39went on pilgrimage to Hitler sites\u0026#39Key Afghan police chief killed in shooting at governor\u0026#39s compound after meeting with US generalWrong-way M40 crash car had been in a collision five days earlier, police revealMarriage to Victoria Beckham can be complicated, says her husband DavidStories, National Theatre, review: a sperm-donor drama with plenty of laughs, but not enough heartReality star tells court her collagen lip implants prevented her from blowing into breathalyser How Merkel and Macron spent more time in the pub than listening to May\u0026#39s Brexit overturesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/17/TELEMMGLPICT000162294722_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PUPXbRlaI4_qh_dM2Z5d688.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"no question should new 50 note lady thatcher","story":"A petition has been launched to put Lady Thatcher on the new £50 note Ambitious and self-made, her legacy has never felt more important One of the few things I envy about previous generations of Britons is the quality of their leaders.

But only a small number of them are being observed. I don\u0027t think it will affect cherry blossom viewing (next year), he told NHK.Please review our commenting policyDaniel Ortega unleashes Orwellian repression as Nicaragua accused of torturing

(BCC) indicated that half of businesses have to consider uncertainty over Brexit when deciding whether to trade internationally.The BCC said its poll of 2,500 firms highlighted the economic cost of the persistent lack of political clarity.Half of firms were also concerned by the related issue of exchange rate volatility, which can increase the cost of raw materials and potentially make UK exports less competitive, the BCC added.Brexit- LIVE: May told she is \u0027losing the confidence of colleagues\u0027Senior Tories round on May over U-turn on meaningful Brexit voteEU leaders decide

the referendum vote over two years ago.However, this survey shows that, as we get closer to the crunch, the lack of precision is starting to have a material impact on their decision-making.While business faces uncertain times, our research shows that businesses who do trade internationally are more innovative and dynamic compared to those who just focus their attention on the UK market.It is vital that clear progress is made in Brexit negotiations to give firms confidence and empower them to take risks and try to break into new markets, creating the Global Britain this Government so often talks about.Shannon Diett, of DHL Express UK, which helped with the study, said: The uncertainty expressed by British businesses taking part in this survey mirrors the increasing concern we are

What caught the City on the hop was by how much.\u0026nbspOfficial figures revealed sales volumes fell by 0.8 per cent when the consensus forecast was for the figure to come in at 0.4 per cent lower. Food was inevitably a big cause of the drag. People’s barbecue sets are now firmly back in the garage.\u0026nbspFor the three months to September things look a\u0026nbsplittle better. It is true that overall sales were up, and by 1.2 per cent. But it’s the trend you need to look at. That number is much lower than the 1.9 per cent rise recorded in the three months to July.UK retail sales fall by more than expected in SeptemberWorld Cup and heatwave boost UK retail sales in JulySterling falls as UK retail sales in June much worse than expectedWith consumer spending such a big part of the UK economy, this doesn’t bode well for the future. \u0026nbspWe can’t be sure quite how much of an impact the steady diet of dreadful news about Brexit is playing into shoppers’ behaviour. All we know is that it is having an impact.\u0026nbspThat’s only making things more difficult for a retail industry that didn’t really cease its shivering even in the heat of the balmy summer.\u0026nbspBitter laughter is, I imagine, the response in its boardrooms whenever someone like David Davis dribbles on about the “benefits of Brexit”. People living in the real world, and the real economy, increasingly see things very differently.\u0026nbspSome chains, with bricks and mortar as well as internet operations, are making efforts to address the difficult situation they face. They would be necessary even had the festering boil of Brexit been lanced because of the disruption the industry is enduring. It has already killed off several businesses, and and it will go on killing for some time.\u0026nbspJohn Lewis is a good example of a retailer with the willingness to try things. It’s new store - yes you read that right - in Cheltenham is being used as a test bed for more than 20 different “services and experiences”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The UK, which currently sits on the UN human rights council, has traditionally been hostile to the treaty, which is supported by Ecuador, South Africa and a number of other developing countries.Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, said the vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of global problems including inequality and climate change.\u0026nbsp“The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Yet there are very few ways that citizens can hold these corporations to account for their behaviour. Rather, through trade and investment deals, it is corporations which are able to demand that governments do their bidding.\u0026nbsp“The UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power – through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business.\u0026nbsp“Disgracefully it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN. That’s why today we’re joining campaigns from across the world to tell the British government not to block this international demand for justice.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There was a decline in non-store retailing activity and no growth from non-food stores.Over the three months to September sales volumes were still up 1.2 per cent, although this was down from the 1.9 per cent rate in the three months to July.Retail sales account for around 30 per cent of total consumer spending and are seen as a bellwether of the direction of the overall economy.“Some easing back in retail sales was always to be expected in September given the overall strength in August and July,” said\u0026nbspHoward Archer of the EY Item Club.He added that third-quarter growth “buoys belief that consumer spending\u0026nbspmade an appreciable contribution as GDP growth likely improved to at least 0.6 per cent\u0026nbspquarter-on-quarter in the third quarter.”The ONS estimates that GDP growth was 0.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2018.But other analysts were less optimistic.“It looks like consumer spending – along with the weather – peaked in early summer and has been declining ever since,” said Ben Brettell of Hargreaves Lansdown.“Where we go from here is highly uncertain. Brexit is hitting consumer confidence hard, but on the plus side wage growth has hit a decade high while inflation is falling. So consumers look likely to have more spending power – the issue is whether they choose to use it, or keep their powder dry until more clarity over Brexit emerges.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They have a social and financial responsibility to be transparent – that\u0027s why we\u0027re demanding independence and accountability in the company\u0027s boardroom, said New York City Comnptroller\u0026nbspScott Stringer.An independent board chair is essential to moving Facebook forward from this mess, and to reestablish trust with Americans and investors alike.The proposal will be put to a vote at the company\u0027s annual shareholder meeting in May 2019, however it will be largely symbolic due to the control that Mr Zuckerberg has over the company\u0027s board.Mr Zuckerberg\u0027s reign at Facebook has previously been compared to a dictatorship because he owns a majority of voting rights to the firm.In an op-ed earlier this year, a member of the California State Teachers\u0027 Retirement System (CalSTRS), which holds shares in Facebook, called for the company to make changes to reflect its size.Facebook has grown at an unbelievable pace. The capital structure has changed and it is time for its governance to catch up, CalSTRS\u0026nbspinvestment officer Aeisha Mastagni wrote in\u0026nbspThe Financial Times.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Rather than Chrome and Google search, as users have seen ever since Android was introduced, there could be something else entirely.The change is good news for other browsers and search engines, which could now come pre-installed on Android phones instead of Chrome.Given recent data scandals from tech firms like Facebook and Google, device manufacturers may decide to make a statement by introducing apps that focus on online privacy.Private search engine DuckDuckGo could be among those to benefit, which currently represents only 0.18 per cent of the global search market.The privacy-focussed search engine processes around 30 million searches per day – the same number as Google handles in about 15 minutes.What does this mean for Google\u0027s mobile dominance?More than 80 per cent of the world\u0027s smartphones run the Android operating system, and this is unlikely to change significantly as a result of Google\u0027s new licensing system.What could change is the pervasiveness of its search engine, apps and other features. Perhaps the\u0026nbspmost significant of the features subject to the fees is the Play Store, which serves as a gateway through which popular apps can be downloaded.Not all apps are available through Google Play – earlier this year, Epic Games decided to roll out the Android version of its hugely popular game Fortnite\u0026nbspthrough its own website in order to avoid paying\u0026nbspGoogle for the privilege of hosting the app on Google Play.\u0026nbspBut this is an exception, not the rule.If the licensing fees prove too burdensome for phone and tablet manufacturers, this way of distributing apps may become a trend that threatens Google\u0027s monopoly of everything from email to maps.Google admits giving hundreds of firms access to your Gmail inboxEven without Google Play, Fortnite was able to amass more than 15 million downloads on Android within a month of launching, proving Google\u0027s app store is not a prerequisite for success.As Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney explained at the time: The great thing about the internet and the digital revolution is that this is possible, now that physical storefronts and middlemen distributors are no longer required.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

More than two decades later, Tan, now a novelist in L.A., returns to the country of her youth and to the memories of a man who both enabled and thwarted her dreams. Magically, too, she returns to the film itself, revived in a way she never could have imagined.313 The Other Side of the Wind - out on 2 NovemberIn 1970, legendary director Orson Welles (Citizen Kane) began filming what would ultimately be his final cinematic opus with a cast of luminaries that included John Huston, Peter Bogdanovich, Susan Strasberg and Welles’s partner during his later years, Oja Kodar. Beset by financial issues, the production ultimately stretched to 1976 and soon gained industry-wide notoriety, never to be completed or released. 413 They\u0027ll Love Me When I\u0027m Dead - out on 2 NovemberOscar-winning director Morgan Neville (20 Feet from Stardom) tells the provocative story of legendary director Orson Welles during the final 15 years of his life.

Each chapter tells a distinct story about the American West.713 The Christmas Chronicles - out on 22 November​The Christmas Chronicles, a holiday adventure from producer Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter) and director Clay Kaytis (The Angry Birds Movie), tells the story of sister and brother, Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (Judah Lewis), whose Christmas Eve plan to catch Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) on camera turns into an unexpected journey that most kids could only dream about. The most personal project to date from Academy Award®-winning director and writer Alfonso Cuarón (Gravity, Children of Men, Y Tu Mama Tambien), ROMA follows Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), a young domestic worker for a family in the middle-class neighborhood of Roma in Mexico City. Delivering an artful love letter to the women who raised him, Cuarón draws on his own childhood to create a vivid and emotional portrait of domestic strife and social hierarchy amidst political turmoil of the 1970s.

Normally these kinds of structures are known at lower redshifts, which means when the Universe has had much more time to evolve and construct such huge things. It was a surprise to see something this evolved when the Universe was relatively young!The structure, which is known by scientists as Hyperion, was spotted by a team of scientists who used the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope to peer into the early universe and look for galaxies forming. It was then they spotted Hyperion, a colossal mass that is more than a million billion times that of the Sun.Vast cosmic explosions could be flinging gold across the universeIt is not only huge but very complex. Hyperion is made up of at least seven high-density regions, which are strung together by threads of galaxies. That structure is different to the kind of superclusters we usually see closer to us, even though the size is similar.Superclusters closer to Earth tend to a much more concentrated distribution of mass with clear structural features, explains Brian Lemaux, an astronomer from University of California, Davis and LAM, and a member of the team behind this result. But in Hyperion, the mass is distributed much more uniformly in a series of connected blobs, populated by loose associations of galaxies.The difference is probably a consequence of the fact that the closer by superclusters have had billions of years of being pushed into denser regions by galaxies. Hyperion, which is much younger, has been subject to that process much less.Eventually, Hyperion will probably evolve into something similar to those structures: the kind that make up the Sloan Great Wall, or the Virgo Supercluster in which our own galaxy sits. Understanding how that process happens could allow us to peer into the past of our own galaxy and understand how it might have formed.Understanding Hyperion and how it compares to similar recent structures can give insights into how the Universe developed in the past and will evolve into the future, and allows us the opportunity to challenge some models of supercluster formation, said\u0026nbspCucciati. Unearthing this cosmic titan helps uncover the history of these large-scale structures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People start off in different places.”The scientists came to their conclusions by studying 3,000 pairs of British twins – identical and non-identical.“Identical twins are 100 per cent genetically identical, they are clones of one another, so they share all their DNA and they share a home environment – so any differences between identical twins can’t be due to their home environment, can’t be due to their genes,” said Dr Smith-Woolley.Comparing identical and non-identical pairs of twins enabled\u0026nbspresearchers to measure the overall impact of genetics on how much people differ when it comes to measures such as exam scores.More than 1,000 genes that influence academic success identifiedIf identical twins’ exam scores are more alike than non-identical twins’, it is an indication genetic factors are driving that success.Using\u0026nbspComplete University Guide\u0026nbsprankings to determine institution quality, the scientists also found the quality of university that students opted for was influenced by genes, even after accounting for A-level achievement.Besides their twin study – which is not able to identify specific genes linked to achievement – researchers\u0026nbspalso calculated “polygenic scores”, adding up the effects of thousands of DNA variants previous studies have linked to success in education.The resulting\u0026nbspscores accounted for a small fraction of the differences between people, compared to the results of the twin study – an effect the scientists think results from the small number of genes so far linked with educational achievement.“That’s fairly small at the moment … but I think it shows that science is getting to the point where it can start predicting outcomes from DNA alone.”Dr David Hill, a statistical geneticist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study, said the research was sound, but perhaps not surprising.Scientists think most behaviours are probably the results of a complex interaction between genes and people’s environments.Considering previous research that has demonstrated the way in which educational success appears to be inherited within families, he said it was already clear there is a genetic component.“I don’t really think anyone would expect there to not be a genetic influence acting on university success,” he said, “given that all traits are expected to be somewhat heritable, and we already know that educational success, intelligence, personality, and whether or not one chooses to take university entrance exams and how well they do at them, have all been shown to be heritable.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Smaller craft have previously employed ion thrusters to reach asteroids and the moon.The ion drive will be used not to accelerate the spacecraft but to act as a brake as it falls into the grip of the sun\u0027s powerful gravity.A complex series of fly-bys past the Earth, Venus and Mercury will further reduce its velocity.Even so, BepiColumbo will reach a top speed of 60 kilometres (37 miles) per second.The European Space Agency\u0027s Mercury Planet Orbiter (MPO), which will survey the planet\u0027s surface and probe its chemistry, was built by satellite company Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage.Airbus also constructed the power unit carrying the orbiters, the Mercury Transfer Module (MTM), in the UK. The ion thrusters were supplied by British defence technology company QinetiQ.One of the European orbiter\u0027s 11 instruments, the Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (Mixs) was designed and built at the University of Leicester.The Japanese space agency Jaxa\u0027s Mercury Magnetosphere Orbiter (MMO) will study the planet\u0027s internal structure and enveloping magnetic field.A major challenge for mission planners was ensuring the spacecraft could withstand searing temperatures of more than 350C so close to the sun.Protective measures include a heat shield, novel ceramic and titanium insulation, ammonia-filled heat pipes, and in the case of the Japanese orbiter, spinning.Dr Graham Turnock, chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said: UK scientists, engineers and technicians have played a vital role in developing BepiColombo and the incredibly sophisticated set of scientific instruments on board.The international collaboration involved in this mission shows how our leading role in the European Space Agency is ensuring the UK thrives in the new space age, bringing real benefits to UK companies and scientists.Only two spacecraft have previously visited Mercury. Nasa\u0027s Mariner 10 flew past the planet three times in 1974-75 and the American space agency\u0027s Messenger probe orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015, taking photos of the surface.Dr Jerry Bolter, project manager at Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage, said: The scientists describe Messenger as the hors d\u0027oeuvre and Bepi asThe spacecraft was named after the late Guiseppe Bepi Colombo, an Italian scientist and engineer who played a leading role in the 1974 Mariner 10 mission to Mercury.Paolo Ferri, head of missions at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, said: Mercury is a planet of extremes, and getting there requires some equally extreme techniques, navigation solutions and operations expertise.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If such an event took place today it would likely disrupt much of the planet’s communication technology.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857)This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.  And, of course, the bully Flashman, without whom we wouldn’t have George McDonald Fraser’s hilarious series detailing his further adventures. 230 29. The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter (1902)Even Potter knew she was writing nostalgically about an imagined past but who could not fail to love this slyly observed tale of a naughty rabbit? Potter’s arch, almost Austen-esque prose interacts seamlessly with her keenly observed studies of flora and fauna. Avoid the new film, and stick to the original.330 28. How to Train Your Dragon by Cressida Cowell (2003)Quite simply, Cressida Cowell has an exceptional  ability to give children what they like. Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III is a Viking who doesn’t fit in: gawky and geeky, his adventures with his hunting-dragon Toothless are madcap and marvellous. Give it to a child, and see them become engrossed immediately. 430 27. The Lie Tree by Frances Hardinge (2015, Macmillan)The recent winner of the overall Costa Book Awards is a remarkable novel from a remarkable writer. Hardinge is a true original, her sentences poised and poetic, her alternative 19th-century world fully imagined, and her intelligent, inquiring female lead not simply a good role model but also a fine addition to literature.530 26. Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman (2001)Former Children’s Laureate Malorie Blackman’s novel described a world in which black Africans had enslaved white Europeans. Whites, or noughts, were economically impoverished, whilst the blacks, or crosses, were in power. An inter-racial love affair between two teens brings first passion and then tragedy. Powerful, provocative and original.630 25. The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban (1967)A bittersweet and unusual tale, in which a clockwork mouse and his child are thrown out of a toy shop, and then must embark on a journey to find safety. Unlike the film Toy Story, in which the toys are complicit in their servitude, this allows discarded toys to find a world of their own, constructed according to their own terms. Full of striking imagery and exciting scenes. 730 24. Down with Skool! A Guide to School Life for Tiny Pupils and their Parents by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle (1953)As any fule know, reading Molesworth is like being a member of a secret skool gang. Complemented by Ronald Searle’s satirical drawings of depressed, deluded schoolmasters and grubby, disobedient schoolboys, all the world’s vanity and hypocrisy is on display through Molesworth’s cynical, instantly likeable and badly spelled voice. A grate writer, indeed.830 23. Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer (2001)A wondrously clever book that upturns children’s literature convention. Its hero, Artemis Fowl, is a 12 year old boy who also happens to be a criminal mastermind. Containing such characters as a kleptomaniac, flatulent dwarf, and a centaur called Foaly who’s also a technical whizz, this is a hilarious delight. 930 22. The Scarecrows by Robert Westall (1981)I’ve chosen The Scarecrows over The Machine Gunners, which is perhaps Westall’s better known book, as I think this has a quality of terror and an understanding of adolescence that is matchless. It focuses on a boy’s tortured relationship with his stepfather, and the encroachment of a murder that happened many years before. Unforgettably spine-tingling, and profoundly affecting.1030 21. The Harry Potter series by J K Rowling (late 20th century)First published over 20 years ago, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone blazed into the world’s consciousness like a bolt of lightning. Moving from the initial wonder and quirky charm of the first three books, the series took on a darker tone, resulting in an enthralling septet and a cultural phenomenon.1130 20. The Ghost of Thomas Kemp by Penelope Lively (1973)Penelope Lively once said that “Children need to sense that we live in a permanent world that reaches away behind and ahead of us.” Her writing encompasses a huge range, and this, her Carnegie-winning novel about a house beset by the spirit of a sorceror, is eerie, effective and involving.1230 19. Tom’s Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce (1958)Considered by many to be one of children’s literature’s most outstanding examples. Tom is packed away to stay with his aunt and uncle: but when the clock strikes thirteen, he finds a gorgeous garden, and in it a little girl called Hatty, who seems to come from a different time. Emotionally rich, it will leave a lasting impression on any child. 1330 18. The Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin (1968)The recent death of Ursula Le Guin, aged 88, has brought renewed attention to her works. Ged, a dark skinned boy from the goat herding island of Gont, demonstrates exceptional powers and is sent to learn how to be a wizard. His resulting quest is epic, with a depth and strangeness that lasts.1430 17. The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken (1962)This has all the hallmarks of classic children’s literature: missing parents, a usurping adult, terrible injustices and the romance of winter and wolves. Set in an alternative historical era, where James III rules, little Bonnie’s fortune is snatched by a sinister governess. Children will cheer when she gets her comeuppance.1530 16. The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf (1936)What at first seems to be a delightful story about a little bull who hates fighting becomes a potent fable about what’s expected of boys. Rejecting masculine violence, Ferdinand prefers just to sit under a cork tree. The illustrations of Spanish matadors, picadors and their arenas are astoundingly evocative. 1630 15. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak (1963)A picture book that reveals more about itself each time it’s read. Note how the pictures expand as Max’s imaginative world grows how the text, poetic and spare, interacts with the visuals how Max, through his journey into the interior of his self, meets and conquers his anger at his mother. The drawings are lovely, too.1730 14. Matilda by Roald Dahl (1988)I’m willing to bet that after reading this, many children stared at pencils, hoping they might be able to move them with their mind alone. Dahl’s exuberant imagination is on full display in this emotionally weighty story about a little girl’s fight for love and escape. Miss Trunchbull, the vicious headmistress, is one of literature’s great villains.1830 13. The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling (1894)Raised by wolves, Mowgli must face the terrible tiger Shere Khan, with the help of Baloo, a “sleepy brown bear”, and Bagheera, a panther. Full of invention and adventure, the stories were an immediate hit, the behaviour of the animals believable and, paradoxically, human. Their wildness and subtleties have become thoroughly imbued into the popular imagination.1930 12. Five Children and It by E Nesbit (1902)A representative from the first Golden Age of children’s fiction in the early 20th century. Nesbit’s grumpy, vain wish-granting Psammead (or “sand fairy”), an immortal who used to eat Pterodactyl for breakfast, offers adventure in a world without oppressive evil. The brothers and sisters find that magic doesn’t always offer a solution.2030 11. The Once and Future King by T H White (1958)Captivating, wise, witty, this collection of three earlier books treats the Matter of Britain. TH White’s masterstroke was to imagine the young king Arthur as Wart, an ordinary boy thrust into extraordinary situations and his Merlin as a kindly, forgetful old man (viz. Dumbledore). Neglected in recent years, White deserves a place in the limelight once more.2130 10. The Wind in the Willows  by Kenneth Grahame (1908)There is some debate as to whether The Wind in the Willows is a children’s book, or whether it’s really a book to lift up the spirits of down-trodden city clerks. Either way, the gentle adventures of Mole and Ratty, and Toad’s ridiculous shenanigans, express a lyrical love of the pleasures of rural life.2230 9. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (1937)In The Hobbit, an odder book than it at first appears, the tiny hairy-footed Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with some dwarves, and is actually rewarded for being a thief. The charm of the hobbits’ world is matched by the excitement of the adventures Bilbo finds himself entangled in and many readers will be led on to its vast sequel, The Lord of the Rings. 2330 8. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (1995)Philip Pullman’s daemons, in his lavishly-imagined alternative world run by a sinister religious organisation, are among the most enduring creations of children’s literature. His themes are cosmic and vast, with a dizzying sense of possibility his story spellbinding and in Lyra Belacqua, he made a heroine at once appealing, spiky and enduring. 2430 7. The Narnia series by C S Lewis (mid 20th century)The best children’s books have a way of altering the universe around them. Everyone can remember their first encounter with Narnia, and then trying to get through the back of the wardrobe afterwards into the enticing other world. Lewis’ stroke of genius, of course, was making the animals talk the knightly adventures of the children are gripping.2530 6. The Pilgrim\u0027s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan (1678)One of the first books enthusiastically taken up by children, this is now largely neglected, even by adults and scholars unjustly so, as its allegorical power and beauty are unsurpassed. Its humour and colloquial nature mean it is still accessible. From the Slough of Despond to the Celestial City, it brims with memorable places and people. 2630 5. Peter and Wendy by J M Barrie (1911)Some would argue that this novelised form of the play Peter Pan is not a children’s book, being instead complicit with an ironic, adult viewpoint however this, and all its variants, are enjoyed immensely by children. There is the theme-park like world of Neverland the sense of unbounded imagination and the dizzying allure of flight and magic.2730 4. The One Thousand and One Nights by Anon. (Folk tales)This scintillating series, which Scheherazade spins to her royal husband every night so that he spares her life to hear their conclusion, first came to Europe in 1704 in a French text that also contained Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor. Elemental, opulent and wondrous, the stories are full of passion and revenges, and remain enormously influential.2830 3. Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen (19th century)A strange and shy man, Hans Christian Andersen produced some of the most beautiful and reverberant literary fairy tales in the world, about loss, love and longing. Gerda’s search for her brother Kay in ‘The Snow Queen’ the Little Mermaid’s mute passion for her prince gorgeously written, they offer solace and enchantment. 2930 2. Kinder- und Hausmärchen (‘Nursery and Household Tales’) by The Brothers Grimm (19th century)Exceptionally influential, this collection of over 200 tales underwent many editions in the Grimms’ lifetime. Though the seamier elements were altered for a prudish bourgeois audience, the fairy tales retain a depth which resonates with children and adults alike.  We all know The Frog Prince and Hansel and Gretel but have you read “Hans my Hedgehog”, about a half boy, half hedgehog? 3030 1. The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.130 30. Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857)This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.  And, of course, the bully Flashman, without whom we wouldn’t have George McDonald Fraser’s hilarious series detailing his further adventures. 230 29.

Hardinge is a true original, her sentences poised and poetic, her alternative 19th-century world fully imagined, and her intelligent, inquiring female lead not simply a good role model but also a fine addition to literature.530 26. Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman (2001)Former Children’s Laureate Malorie Blackman’s novel described a world in which black Africans had enslaved white Europeans. Whites, or noughts, were economically impoverished, whilst the blacks, or crosses, were in power. An inter-racial love affair between two teens brings first passion and then tragedy. Powerful, provocative and original.630 25. The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban (1967)A bittersweet and unusual tale, in which a clockwork mouse and his child are thrown out of a toy shop, and then must embark on a journey to find safety. Unlike the film Toy Story, in which the toys are complicit in their servitude, this allows discarded toys to find a world of their own, constructed according to their own terms. Full of striking imagery and exciting scenes. 730 24. Down with Skool! A Guide to School Life for Tiny Pupils and their Parents by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle (1953)As any fule know, reading Molesworth is like being a member of a secret skool gang. Complemented by Ronald Searle’s satirical drawings of depressed, deluded schoolmasters and grubby, disobedient schoolboys, all the world’s vanity and hypocrisy is on display through Molesworth’s cynical, instantly likeable and badly spelled voice. A grate writer, indeed.830 23. Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer (2001)A wondrously clever book that upturns children’s literature convention. Its hero, Artemis Fowl, is a 12 year old boy who also happens to be a criminal mastermind. Containing such characters as a kleptomaniac, flatulent dwarf, and a centaur called Foaly who’s also a technical whizz, this is a hilarious delight. 930 22. The Scarecrows by Robert Westall (1981)I’ve chosen The Scarecrows over The Machine Gunners, which is perhaps Westall’s better known book, as I think this has a quality of terror and an understanding of adolescence that is matchless. It focuses on a boy’s tortured relationship with his stepfather, and the encroachment of a murder that happened many years before. Unforgettably spine-tingling, and profoundly affecting.1030 21. The Harry Potter series by J K Rowling (late 20th century)First published over 20 years ago, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone blazed into the world’s consciousness like a bolt of lightning. Moving from the initial wonder and quirky charm of the first three books, the series took on a darker tone, resulting in an enthralling septet and a cultural phenomenon.1130 20. The Ghost of Thomas Kemp by Penelope Lively (1973)Penelope Lively once said that “Children need to sense that we live in a permanent world that reaches away behind and ahead of us.” Her writing encompasses a huge range, and this, her Carnegie-winning novel about a house beset by the spirit of a sorceror, is eerie, effective and involving.1230 19. Tom’s Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce (1958)Considered by many to be one of children’s literature’s most outstanding examples. Tom is packed away to stay with his aunt and uncle: but when the clock strikes thirteen, he finds a gorgeous garden, and in it a little girl called Hatty, who seems to come from a different time. Emotionally rich, it will leave a lasting impression on any child. 1330 18. The Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin (1968)The recent death of Ursula Le Guin, aged 88, has brought renewed attention to her works. Ged, a dark skinned boy from the goat herding island of Gont, demonstrates exceptional powers and is sent to learn how to be a wizard. His resulting quest is epic, with a depth and strangeness that lasts.1430 17. The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken (1962)This has all the hallmarks of classic children’s literature: missing parents, a usurping adult, terrible injustices and the romance of winter and wolves. Set in an alternative historical era, where James III rules, little Bonnie’s fortune is snatched by a sinister governess. Children will cheer when she gets her comeuppance.1530 16. The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf (1936)What at first seems to be a delightful story about a little bull who hates fighting becomes a potent fable about what’s expected of boys. Rejecting masculine violence, Ferdinand prefers just to sit under a cork tree. The illustrations of Spanish matadors, picadors and their arenas are astoundingly evocative. 1630 15. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak (1963)A picture book that reveals more about itself each time it’s read. Note how the pictures expand as Max’s imaginative world grows how the text, poetic and spare, interacts with the visuals how Max, through his journey into the interior of his self, meets and conquers his anger at his mother. The drawings are lovely, too.1730 14. Matilda by Roald Dahl (1988)I’m willing to bet that after reading this, many children stared at pencils, hoping they might be able to move them with their mind alone. Dahl’s exuberant imagination is on full display in this emotionally weighty story about a little girl’s fight for love and escape. Miss Trunchbull, the vicious headmistress, is one of literature’s great villains.1830 13. The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling (1894)Raised by wolves, Mowgli must face the terrible tiger Shere Khan, with the help of Baloo, a “sleepy brown bear”, and Bagheera, a panther. Full of invention and adventure, the stories were an immediate hit, the behaviour of the animals believable and, paradoxically, human. Their wildness and subtleties have become thoroughly imbued into the popular imagination.1930 12. Five Children and It by E Nesbit (1902)A representative from the first Golden Age of children’s fiction in the early 20th century. Nesbit’s grumpy, vain wish-granting Psammead (or “sand fairy”), an immortal who used to eat Pterodactyl for breakfast, offers adventure in a world without oppressive evil. The brothers and sisters find that magic doesn’t always offer a solution.2030 11. The Once and Future King by T H White (1958)Captivating, wise, witty, this collection of three earlier books treats the Matter of Britain. TH White’s masterstroke was to imagine the young king Arthur as Wart, an ordinary boy thrust into extraordinary situations and his Merlin as a kindly, forgetful old man (viz. Dumbledore). Neglected in recent years, White deserves a place in the limelight once more.2130 10. The Wind in the Willows  by Kenneth Grahame (1908)There is some debate as to whether The Wind in the Willows is a children’s book, or whether it’s really a book to lift up the spirits of down-trodden city clerks. Either way, the gentle adventures of Mole and Ratty, and Toad’s ridiculous shenanigans, express a lyrical love of the pleasures of rural life.2230 9. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (1937)In The Hobbit, an odder book than it at first appears, the tiny hairy-footed Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with some dwarves, and is actually rewarded for being a thief. The charm of the hobbits’ world is matched by the excitement of the adventures Bilbo finds himself entangled in and many readers will be led on to its vast sequel, The Lord of the Rings. 2330 8. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (1995)Philip Pullman’s daemons, in his lavishly-imagined alternative world run by a sinister religious organisation, are among the most enduring creations of children’s literature. His themes are cosmic and vast, with a dizzying sense of possibility his story spellbinding and in Lyra Belacqua, he made a heroine at once appealing, spiky and enduring. 2430 7. The Narnia series by C S Lewis (mid 20th century)The best children’s books have a way of altering the universe around them. Everyone can remember their first encounter with Narnia, and then trying to get through the back of the wardrobe afterwards into the enticing other world. Lewis’ stroke of genius, of course, was making the animals talk the knightly adventures of the children are gripping.2530 6. The Pilgrim\u0027s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan (1678)One of the first books enthusiastically taken up by children, this is now largely neglected, even by adults and scholars unjustly so, as its allegorical power and beauty are unsurpassed. Its humour and colloquial nature mean it is still accessible. From the Slough of Despond to the Celestial City, it brims with memorable places and people. 2630 5. Peter and Wendy by J M Barrie (1911)Some would argue that this novelised form of the play Peter Pan is not a children’s book, being instead complicit with an ironic, adult viewpoint however this, and all its variants, are enjoyed immensely by children. There is the theme-park like world of Neverland the sense of unbounded imagination and the dizzying allure of flight and magic.2730 4. The One Thousand and One Nights by Anon. (Folk tales)This scintillating series, which Scheherazade spins to her royal husband every night so that he spares her life to hear their conclusion, first came to Europe in 1704 in a French text that also contained Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor. Elemental, opulent and wondrous, the stories are full of passion and revenges, and remain enormously influential.2830 3. Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen (19th century)A strange and shy man, Hans Christian Andersen produced some of the most beautiful and reverberant literary fairy tales in the world, about loss, love and longing. Gerda’s search for her brother Kay in ‘The Snow Queen’ the Little Mermaid’s mute passion for her prince gorgeously written, they offer solace and enchantment. 2930 2. Kinder- und Hausmärchen (‘Nursery and Household Tales’) by The Brothers Grimm (19th century)Exceptionally influential, this collection of over 200 tales underwent many editions in the Grimms’ lifetime. Though the seamier elements were altered for a prudish bourgeois audience, the fairy tales retain a depth which resonates with children and adults alike.  We all know The Frog Prince and Hansel and Gretel but have you read “Hans my Hedgehog”, about a half boy, half hedgehog? 3030 1. The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.“I think it’s fair to say that Caroll’s view of the world and how we should treat each other has shaped and defined our organisation.”Oscar the GrouchShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He declined to explain further.When asked about the notice, a\u0026nbspspokeswoman for the Ralph Allen School declined to comment.In its latest Ofsted report following an inspection in March this year, the school received a “good” rating. Inspectors praised staff who they said had accurately determined its strengths and what needed to be improved.Combe Down, Bath (SWNS)Local reports suggested the sign had\u0026nbsplater\u0026nbspbeen amended to say only\u0026nbsp“pupils”, without specifying a school.A spokesman for the Co-op apologised when contacted by The Independent.He said: The store was intending to manage the numbers of children who enter a very small store. It\u0026nbspwas never the intention to cause offence, and we are sorry that it has not been handled as well as it could have been.It is a very small store and a local decision was made to manage the numbers of pupils - from any school – who, unaccompanied by parents, enter the store at peak times. We sincerely apologise, there was never any intention to cause offence.Additional reporting by SWNSShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

or anyone deemed to have driven dangerously close to a cyclist - can expect to be prosecuted and taken to court.Cycling and Walking Minister Jesse Norman said: Cycling and walking are increasingly being understood as crucial parts of an integrated approach to issues of health, obesity, air quality and town and city planning.But this will only happen if people feel safe on the roads.These measures are part of a steady process of improvement and reform designed to achieve just that.Highways England is also announcing a £3m\u0026nbspcontract with Sustrans for improvements to the National Cycle Network.Anger over ‘shameful’ Tory tweet announcing new cycling lawsDuncan Dollimore, head of campaigns at charity Cycling UK, said: Close overtakes and people opening car doors in front of cyclists are not only dangerous, they also put people off riding a bike.That\u0027s why Cycling UK has been campaigning for changes to the Highway Code rules for many years, to make the requirements crystal clear to give enough space when overtaking a cyclist, wait if you can\u0027t, and look before you open your car door.We\u0027re delighted the government has listened and we hope to contribute to the discussions regarding the amendments required to prioritise the safety of cyclists and other vulnerable road users.The move comes as the government is considering introducing new offences for dangerous cycling.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers with a bomb disposal robot on Victoria Embankment opposite Scotland Yard police headquarters in central London after emergency services were alerted to reports of a suspicious packageScottish Power will become the first major UK energy company to generate the entirety of its power from wind after selling its remaining gas and hydro stations to Drax in a £702 million dealPrime Minister Theresa May peers into a hot water urn during a meeting at a social group in Vauxhall from a charity working to combat loneliness at the launch of the first loneliness strategy.

What we are not doing – we are not standing here proposing an extension to the implementation period.What we are doing is working to ensure we have a solution the backstop in Northern Ireland, which is currently a blockage to completing the deal, that enables us to get on with completing the deal that delivers on the vote of the British people and is good for the future of the UK.Ms May\u0027s cryptic answer could be a response to disquiet in her party about the plans.\u0026nbspThe period – during which the UK would stay completely tied to EU rules without any say on them – is hugely unpopular with Brexiteers, who believe it would make Britain a “vassal state” of the bloc.On Wednesday evening European Parliament president Antonio Tajani told reporters the Prime Minister had “mentioned the idea of an extension of a transition period as one possibility that is on the table and would be looked into” in a meeting with him and the 27 EU leaders.Other Brussels sources confirmed to The Independent that the PM had also raised the policy in bilateral meetings with top EU officials, and that British negotiators had been sounding out the possibility of extending it in negotiations for “months”.The transition period as currently negotiated would begin when Britain leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 and continue until the first day of 2021. During it practically nothing would change for the UK – Britain would continue to implement all EU law, stay in the single market and customs union and under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.\u0026nbspThe UK would however not be represented in EU institutions like the Parliament, Council, and Commission and would therefore have no say in drawing up the rules.“A further idea that has emerged – and it is an idea at this stage – is to create an option to extend the implementation period for a matter of months – and it would only be for a matter of months,” the Prime Minister told reporters on the summit’s doorstep as she arrived on Thursday morning.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Such an extension would cost United Kingdom billions of pounds, yet our fundamental problem with the EU proposal remains.\u0026nbspThe Northern Ireland party want a Brexit deal that respects the union, and believe that the EU backstop would\u0026nbspundermine the constitutional and economic integrity  of the UK.\u0026nbspMr Dodds added: I am glad that it is not just unionists in Northern Ireland who recognise the dangers of the EU proposals on the backstop to the Union. Such a backstop is unacceptable to many others from right across the United Kingdom.”May takes a question from German newspaper Der Speigel on how she is reassuring the EU leaders that a deal will get through parliament.\u0026nbspShe says she is confident she can achieve that good deal. She will ask MPs to remember what the British people voted for and to think of jobs, security and the unity of the UK. These are all issues MPs will want to think of in their decision.\u0026nbspShe was also asked if she underestimated the unity of the remaining EU leaders. May said she wants the EU to stay strong.Asked if she has enough time to ratify a deal if its agreed in December, May says the government is \u0027intensifying\u0027 work on these issues. She said there is a real sense that EU leaders want a deal to be done.\u0026nbspShe says she is very aware of the legislative requirements of the House of Commons.Theresa May is now answering questions from journalists.\u0026nbspShe says these\u0026nbspwere always going to be tough negotiations and they were always going to get tougher in the final stages. She says further solutions have been put forward to try to deal with the Irish border.\u0026nbspAsked if her party could back the transition extension, May says this idea has been around for a long time. What has now emerged was an option to extend it could be a further solution to the Northern Ireland border.A journalist asks about the transition period, which has been the subject of much speculation.\u0026nbspJuncker says a longer transition period \u0027probably will happen\u0027. He says it is not the best idea but it will give them some room.

Parliament is going to insist on using its proper authority.”And Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, said: “Labour doesn’t accept that the choice facing parliament will be between whatever deal Theresa May cobbles together or no deal.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“That is not a meaningful vote and Ministers can’t be allowed to silence parliament. MPs must be given the opportunity to scrutinise, consider and, where appropriate, amend any resolution the government puts forward.”The controversy comes as hundreds of thousands of people prepare to march in central London this Saturday to demand a People’s Vote referendum.The Independent has been running its own Final Say campaign to demand the referendum, with more than 860,000 people having signed its petition so far.In April, asked whether the motion on the Brexit deal “would be amendable”, Mr Baker replied: “I believe the position is that parliament can always seek to amend motions.”And he suggested MPs would be able to impose a referendum, or seek to change the nature of the deal, which might send the prime minister back to the negotiating table.EU leaders decide to shelve plans for Brexit summit in November May rejected EU offer to break Brexit deadlock because of costFrench government warns on visas after no-deal BrexitNHS cannot be \u0027confident\u0027 about medicine supplies after no deal Brexit\u0026nbsp“Clearly, the range of amendments that is possible is within the bounds of the imagination of all members of parliament,” Mr Baker told the committee.But, in his letter, Mr Raab “Once the deal is presented to parliament, the procedure through which it is voted upon must allow for an unequivocal decision, and one which is clear to the British public.”A six-page memorandum suggested amendments would only be accepted if the main motion passed first. If the motion fell, the amendments might only be considered “points of view”.The letter also warned: “Amendments – even those which may not intend to affect approval – may actually result in the government being unable to ratify the withdrawal agreement.“It is important, however, to recognise the need ultimately for the House to consider the question that is in reality before the UK – whether or not to accept the deal that the government has negotiated with the EU.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is universally acknowledged that British music is one of this country’s biggest success stories, with UK artists releasing a staggering one\u0026nbspin 8 albums bought anywhere in the world.For musicians – the protestors include Jarvis Cocker and members of The Chemical Brothers, Super Furry Animals, Mogwai and Pink Floyd, among others – “being in the EU” has played a major part.They point out that no less than 60 per cent of revenues paid to the UK come from the EU, fuelled by a free sharing of data which is now under threat, and that the astonishing vinyl revival is at risk from higher import fees.But, for musicians, it’s much bigger than that. Music is and must be “about embracing and respecting other cultures”, they say – while Brexit will, inevitably, see Britain “isolate ourselves”.“Our concern is that new musicians won’t have the privileges that we had,” says Mr Singh, whose catchy number-one single “Brimful of Asha” was a key soundtrack of the\u0026nbsplate 1990s.Older musicians have grim memories of needing special permission to “get into countries when there wasn’t free movement, but that was a long time ago”, he says.He explains: “Britain is used as a base for touring France and Germany, but artists need to be able to get equipment and people over to Europe and the fear is that will stop because it will be too expensive.”But, for Mr Singh, leaving the EU goes so much deeper than his love for music, because his opposition is an ethos, a state of mind. “Cornershop were anti-Brexit even before Brexit was here,” he says.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchGrowing up in Wolverhampton, memories were fresh of Enoch Powell’s racist “Rivers of Blood” speech\u0026nbspin 1968, which claimed\u0026nbspimmigration would lead to violence and did so much damage to race relations.It’s a controversial view, but Mr Singh insists racism was a “motivation” for some who voted for Brexit, but argues people were also angered by years of cuts – which means they will feel betrayed.“These people won’t be satisfied by what happens after Brexit, because there will be yet more cuts to services, the country will be hobbled by Brexit,” he warns.Here he also targets Jeremy Corbyn for “failing to provide leadership by opposing Brexit”, while echoing claims that EU immigration has lowered workers’ wages here.“Corbyn has gone down the same line and said a lot of the rot that the Conservatives put out – and even Ukip,” Mr Singh protests.“Coming out of the EU is not what’s best for workers and workers’ rights. I find it incredible that Labour doesn’t realise that.”Mr Singh will also be marching because, with a French wife, “we have woken up every morning consumed by Brexit since the referendum”.I’m a former soldier who voted for Brexit- but now I regret itCorbyn under fresh pressure to back a Final Say Brexit referendum10,000 young people to lead major demo calling for fresh Brexit voteWhy so many Tory MPs are privately keen on a Final Say referendumShe quickly applied for UK citizenship, which means she is “a lot more secure than others”, but millions of EU citizens here remain fearful about their future rights.“I wonder why many EU citizens even want to stay in the country when you think how badly they have treated,” the singer says. “It is pitiful that it has got to this.”But, with Theresa May still insisting there will be no Final Say referendum – and Mr Corbyn fighting Labour pressure to back one – can Saturday’s march really achieve its aim?“I think so,” he insists. “One year ago, people laughed at the idea of a People’s Vote happening, but, as the truth has come out, the rupee has dropped and people are understanding we must find out what the country feels now.“We now have much more information and people can take a better-informed view about whether we want to leave the EU or not.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hererivers of bloodShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But she cannot let it distract her from securing a deal on BrexitClick to followIndy PoliticsThe row over universal credit could not have come at a worse time for\u0026nbspTheresa May. With most of Whitehall’s resources and almost all of Downing Street’s political capital focused on Brexit, No 10 is now also having to stave off growing backbench unrest about the government’s flagship welfare policy.The introduction of the new system has been dogged by delays and warnings about the impact on struggling families. Ministers have already made a series of changes and no one doubts that more will be needed. Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, told the Commons yesterday that the government “will make sure we get this benefit right”. People may ask why, six years after the change was approved by parliament, it has not done so already.Tory backbenchers are increasingly concerned about the policy and the impact it will have on their constituents. This is not a minor reform – the switch to universal credit will affect eight million working-age people. MPs are already being bombarded with tales of people forced into debt, destitution and, according to one Labour MP, prostitution\u0026nbspas they are transferred to the new system.Labour fails to force government to release universal credit papersPolitically, too, the fiasco is damaging for the Conservatives. If the next election is not until 2022, it is issues of public services and welfare that could prove pivotal, especially universal credit, which directly affects more than one in eight voters. The public bought into the idea of belt-tightening when it was needed to reduce the deficit. With the economy growing and Ms May having heralded the end of austerity, that argument no longer holds.The tales of hardship that accompany every debate on universal credit will trouble Tories who fear once again being seen as the nasty party, and fuel perceptions that Conservative modernisers worked so hard to dispel.The disastrous implementation of the policy also spectacularly undermines what will inevitably be one of the Tories’ main electoral arguments: that they are the party of competence and efficient management. The problem is not the concept of universal credit, which has cross-party support, but the implementation of it.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers with a bomb disposal robot on Victoria Embankment opposite Scotland Yard police headquarters in central London after emergency services were alerted to reports of a suspicious packageScottish Power will become the first major UK energy company to generate the entirety of its power from wind after selling its remaining gas and hydro stations to Drax in a £702 million dealPrime Minister Theresa May peers into a hot water urn during a meeting at a social group in Vauxhall from a charity working to combat loneliness at the launch of the first loneliness strategy.

The result is a policy pushed through on the cheap, without the proper funding and thought needed to adequately implement such a drastic change to the welfare system. Philip Hammond is likely to use this month’s Budget to plough further money into the policy, but it is unlikely to be enough to solve its\u0026nbspmultiple problems.The frustration for Ms May is that the fiasco causing her such a headache is not of her own making. Universal credit was introduced long before she became prime minister. It is hard to believe that, if she could, Ms May would not quietly scrap it and be done. But that would be a huge admission of failure on the part of her government and a major victory for Labour. \u0026nbspUniversal credit is the greatest blunder by a British government yetInstead we can expect further delays as ministers scramble to amend the flawed policy while also staving off the prospect of a parliamentary defeat. With Tory backbenchers warning that almost 30 of them are prepared to vote against the government on the issue, any significant votes on universal credit\u0026nbspare likely to be pushed back until next summer at the earliest. No 10 cannot afford to let this domestic debacle distract from the task of securing a Brexit deal that can command parliament’s support.The government has managed to unite Jeremy Corbyn and Jacob Rees-Mogg, Gordon Brown and John Major, in calling for the full roll-out to be halted.Mr Major this week compared the row to the poll tax crisis that helped bring down Margaret Thatcher. If he is referring to a government ploughing ahead with a deeply unpopular policy that can only cause it further trouble, the comparison is, for Ms May, worryingly close to the mark.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There was a decline in non-store retailing activity and no growth from non-food stores.Over the three months to September sales volumes were still up 1.2 per cent, although this was down from the 1.9 per cent rate in the three months to July.Retail sales account for around 30 per cent of total consumer spending and are seen as a bellwether of the direction of the overall economy.“Some easing back in retail sales was always to be expected in September given the overall strength in August and July,” said\u0026nbspHoward Archer of the EY Item Club.He added that third-quarter growth “buoys belief that consumer spending\u0026nbspmade an appreciable contribution as GDP growth likely improved to at least 0.6 per cent\u0026nbspquarter-on-quarter in the third quarter.”The ONS estimates that GDP growth was 0.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2018.But other analysts were less optimistic.“It looks like consumer spending – along with the weather – peaked in early summer and has been declining ever since,” said Ben Brettell of Hargreaves Lansdown.“Where we go from here is highly uncertain. Brexit is hitting consumer confidence hard, but on the plus side wage growth has hit a decade high while inflation is falling. So consumers look likely to have more spending power – the issue is whether they choose to use it, or keep their powder dry until more clarity over Brexit emerges.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Instead, these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence,” he wrote.\u0026nbsp“As a result, Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate.”\u0026nbspPompeo arrives in Saudi Arabia to discuss Jamal Khashoggi disappearanceIn the column, Mr Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen who went into self-imposed exile in the US following\u0026nbspthe rise of the crown prince, also discussed the practice of Middle Eastern governments blocking internet access to keep tight control of the information their citizens can see.\u0026nbsp“The Arab world is facing its own version of an Iron Curtain, imposed not by external actors but through domestic forces vying for power,” he wrote.\u0026nbspSuspects in Khashoggi case ‘tied to Saudi Crown Prince or his circle’Turkey seeks to reshape ties with US and Saudi over missing journalistIMF chief pulls out of Saudi conference amid missing journalist stormInside the kingdom, Saudis rattled by handling of Jamal Khashoggi caseHe praised the Post for translating many of his columns into Arabic and said it was important for Middle Easterners to be able to read about democracy in the West.He also said it was critical\u0026nbspArab voices had\u0026nbspa platform from which to be heard.\u0026nbsp“We suffer from poverty, mismanagement and poor education,” Mr Khashoggi wrote. “Through the creation of an independent international forum, isolated from the influence of nationalist governments spreading hate through propaganda, ordinary people in the Arab world would be able to address the structural problems their societies face.”Mr Khashoggi\u0026nbspstarted writing for the\u0026nbspPost’s\u0026nbspopinion section in September 2017 and his columns often criticised the prince and direction the Saudi kingdom was taking.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Smoke billows following an Israeli air strike around the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah.

It could be very expensive to do.It is unknown as to whether this had approval from the Cabinet when it met earlier this week.But it also doesn\u0027t solve the problem of the backstop, because the backstop would remain, as far as one can tell, at the end of this additional transition.It seems to me to be a rather poor attempt at kicking the can down the road.

Finnish Eurocrat opposes Brexit\u0026ldquoBut I do believe unfortunately that Brexit will take place.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos simply a reality that we\u0026rsquoll have to go with.Mr Stubb\u0026nbsp - a candidate for the European Commission Presidency at the end of Juncker\u0027s term - said he believed the longer the transition period the better for both sides to negotiate the future relationship between the UK and the EU.\u0026nbspHe argued transition periods are a key measure to help countries adjust to the change both when they join the EU and when they decide to leave.Prime Minister Theresa May travelled to Brussels on Wednesday in the hope of breaking the longstanding deadlock in\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspnegotiations, specifically around the Irish border.Brexit news: Alexander Stubb claims EU will find a \u0027suboptimal solution\u0027 to the Brexit negotiations (Image: \u0026bullSKY)Mrs May has suggested the Brexit implantation period may need to be extended by a number of months in order to reach an agreement on key issues such as the Irish border.Ms May told reporters this morning: As I said, we have made good progress on withdrawal agreement and future partnership.On the withdrawal agreement, there are issues remaining on the backstop.The original proposal put forward by the\u0026nbspEuropean Union\u0026nbspwas one we could not have accepted in the UK, it would have created a customs border down the Irish sea. Earlier in the year, we put forward a proposal as how to deal with this issue - a further idea has now emerged.A further idea at this stage is to extend the implementation period for a matter of months and only for a matter of months but the point is this is not expected to be used - because we are working to ensure we have that future relationship in place by the end of December 2020.I am clear that it is possible to deliver - there will be no need for any proposal of this sort - and the implementation will end by the end of 2020.The change would mean the UK remaining within the single market and customs union, while being subjected to EU rules and regulation for almost three years after the official Brexit date of March 29, 2019 - and more than five years after the referendum vote to Leave.Furious Brexiteers said the move would add another delay to when the UK could sign new trade deals around the world and would cost taxpayers billions of pounds in additional contributions to the EU.

Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of .“Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.”The new royal will be seventh in line to the throne when he she is born. Prince Harry’s full name is Henry Charles Albert David, and he is styled as His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales.He uses Wales in lieu of a traditional surname as was referred to as Captain Harry Wales when in the military.The Queen officially gave her consent for his wedding to Meghan Markle, releasing a statement using the couple’s real names.It said: “My Lords, I declare My Consent to a Contract of Matrimony between My Most Dearly Beloved Grandson Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales and Rachel Meghan Markle, which Consent I am causing to be signied under the Great Seal and to be entered in the Books of the Privy Council.”Prince Harry needed her permission to marry under the Succession to the Crown Act.The prince also attained the rank of Captain

.Speaking to Newsweek, he recalled the decision — made on his behalf — for him to follow his mum Diana’s coffin after her death.Harry said: “My mother had just died, and I had to walk a long way behind her coffin, surrounded by thousands of people watching me while millions more did on television.“I don’t think any child should be asked to do that, under any circumstances.”Harry has also previously revealed he battled with depression following his mums tragic death.He said he “shut down all his emotions” for two decades after losing his mother Princess Diana.The Prince admitted he had

and his inheritance.When he turned  in , the Prince inherited a trust fund of roughly £m from his mother Diana.Both Harry and his brother, Prince William, inherited their late mothers estate.Camilla

were both at Tonteria nightclub in Sloane Square – shortly after he split from then-girlfriend Cressida Bonas.Asked on Love Island by fellow contestant Sam Gowlandshe had dated Prince Harry, Camilla said: “Honestly, a lady never tells.”It has since been revealed that Camilla dumped Prince Harry over her fears of being rejected by him.A source told Now magazine: “Harry thought she was amazing and seemed to want something serious, but she refused to open up to him through fear of being rejected.“It was Camilla’s reservations that stopped their romance from going anywhere.”His other exes include

This kind of thing is so commonplace that many — some as young as eight — feel street harassment is “part of growing up”. How awful is that  Partly, the problem is that somewhere along the line, the idea that schoolgirls are “sexy” has become normalised, acceptable, even mainstream.Yes, I know that the waters were somewhat muddied by the likes of Britney Spears in her Baby One More Time video and Gemma Arterton in her St Trinian’s films — both looking as sexy as heck in school unorm.  And yes, I know a lot of girls look older than they are, and might even try to do so by wearing make-up, smoking or shortening their skirts on the way to and from school.But let’s be really clear about this. — girls young enough to wear school unorm are children. And the idea of any man thinking it’s OK to wolf-whistle, chat up or give any kind of sexual attention to a girl in a unorm is not just seriously worrying. It should be a criminal offence.By the way, I wonder what a similar survey of boys would find. Because the thought of women wolf-whistling schoolboys in the street is unimaginable, right  Parents of ­secondary school children need to give them some freedom to help them on the path to adulthood.Often, that involves letting them walk unaccompanied to school.  But the idea that doing that is exposing their child to the possibility of sexual harassment will be pretty distressing to any parent.One of the saddest things about this report is how many of the girls interviewed thought this kind of behaviour is “normal”. One -year-old said she felt street harassment was part of the “bro culture” and her dad had told her: “You know what men are like.”  What kind of advice is that for your daughter Another girl, aged , said: “It’s just become normal.” But the net result of behaviour like this is that it makes girls scared of walking the streets.All too often, our response to such news is to try to protect girls by telling them not to look too ­provocative. But that just perpetuates the idea men “can’t help themselves” so it’s down to the girls, and the way they dress, to make sure they are left alone.You can’t blame girls or women for men’s behaviour, no matter what theof their skirt. But the dficult truth is that we know women do have to ­mody their behaviour, and the way they dress, to stop men from ­commenting on their appearance, harassing them or worse.Perhaps what I am most shocked about is the young age at which this starts. One good thing is that these days, girls at secondary school have phones. They can record things that happen to them and report it. Also, Plan International UK is calling on bystanders to challenge harassment when they see it.Certainly,I was around someone wolf-whistling schoolgirls, I’d flip my lid. I would not be too scared to speak my mind and verbally intervene. I think my opening ­gambit would be: “How would you feelthat were your sister, ­granddaughter or daughter some old git was harassing ”To any man reading this who thinks it’s OK to talk to schoolgirls like this, let me tell you some of these girls are terried. It’s not funny or cute. It’s threatening. Lots of teen girls look older than they are butyou are confused and in doubt, here is a clue: The school unorm is a giveaway.Any man who leers at a child in a unorm is nothing short of ­disturbed. Andthey can’t stop themselves from doing so, the law needs to intervene.AS you know, I’m a huge advocate of body acceptance and self-love but I confess to a moment of envy at model Rachel McCord’s fantastic figure.Yes, clearly she must spend most of each day at the gym . . . But you have to give credit where credit is due. And she looks amazing!ANOTHER day, another crazy promise from Labour. This time it was Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell saying a Labour government would bring in a four-day working week.This, as Treasury analysis shows, means Labour would have to borrow £trillion to bankroll its spending spree over the next ten years – the equivalent of £, for every UK household. Frankly,the Labour Party gets into power, it will end up being a zero-day week as business will collapse and there will be no jobs to go to. The simple fact is you can’t run a country or a business on a four-day week.I LOVE a good party as much as the next person.But I can’t be the only person who rolled my eyes at the claim that Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and actress Dakota Johnson hosted a “baby gender reveal party” on Sunday.Apparently, large arches of pink and blue balloons were spotted flying above a star- studded bash at Martin’s Malibu home. Moments later, blue balloons were freed into the air, presumably announcing a baby boy is on the way.The couple claim it was just her birthday party but the singer did help introduce us to the term “conscious uncoupling”. Stand by for this being a new thing . . .She was being “punished” for running away with her Hindu boyfriend.Police were reportedly called to the scene but did not make any arrests – which beggars belief, doesn’t it Stories like this are a reminder that religion can be a negative power as well as a positive.I COULDN’T agree more with Sir Anthony Seldon, above, Buckingham University’s vice-chancellor, who wants the uni to adopt an actively anti-drugs stance.My son is at Buckingham uni and they already have snfer dogs all around campus, randomly checking students. Sir Anthony says he wants to create a “psychological contract” between students and the university so undergraduates implicitly agree to shun drugs when they enrol, which I think is a brilliant idea.His approach is the opposite to Sheffield University, where the student union gave advice on how to take ious hard drugs safely. But the fact is drugs aren’t safe and they ruin lives.  Barely a week goes by without another drug death appearing in the news.Some might say a drug-free campus is unrealistic. And sure, you probably can’t stop everyone taking them.  Nor can you prevent people wanting to experiment.  But making young people really aware that drugs are not only dangerous but illegal can only be a good thing.A WRITER called Kamin Mohammadi had an Instagram rant about “manspreading” this week. And yes, I know this happens. But I think we’ve got to get better at politely asking people to just stop it.Forget gender for a moment. I think it comes down to respect: It’s just blatantly rude to invade someone ’s space and the answer, in my view, is to call the person out.  If someone’s arm is on my arm rest on a train or plane, I ask them – in the nicest possible way – to move it.Let’s not be embarrassed when it’s someone’s legs.My personal bugbear is backpacks. I called a man out for keeping his on while on a crowded Tube train this week and he was really apologetic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We risk being sold down the river.Barring a last-minute revolt by Tory Brexiteers, Brussels has won and we have lost. The world’s sixth-largest economy will not just be worse off outside the EU, but reduced to a powerless political pawn on its margins — and paying for it.Sniggering can be heard across the capitals of Europe, with France guffawing loudest. The British Lion is a toothless kitten and we are the laughing stock of Europe.Unless stopped by her Cabinet, her MPs or by Parliament itself, this Prime Minister seems to be leading us to the greatest defeat since the Norman Conquest in , the last time we capitulated to a foreign power.The ransom demanded for our degrading humiliation — £BILLION of taxpayers’ money — is merely a down payment. The botched Chequers deal will bind this country in subordination to Europe.Forget about becoming a sovereign, free-trading nation. We will accept EU rules indefinitely while having no say at all in their terms or conditions. In effect, our economy will be run by Brussels, not by our democratically elected government.For an example of missed opportunities and failed leadership, this beats even last year’s election disaster, which wasted the first Tory majority for  years and put Marxist Labour within grasp of power.Worse, it now seems the PM’s apparent last-ditch capitulation was stitched up months ago behind closed doors after a dodgy threat by car giants to leave the UK.Now the Tory party is in uproar, with cries for a leadership contest. Downing Street is stupidly threatening a snap election. Nobody buys that except Jeremy Corbyn, who is licking his lips at the scent of power. Ministers, like frogs in a pot, are sizing up whether to jump or stew. Careers will be made or broken.At least three — and maybe six — are threatening to quit at tomorrow’s Cabinet unless Theresa blinks. Tory MPs are close to triggering a leadership fight, with sketchy plans for a quick and ruthless contest. “We have the numbers,” says one Tory MP.“If anything the mood is hardening, not softening.”Ex-Brexit secretary David Davis, the first rebel to quit Cabinet, will certainly run, infuriating Boris Johnson, who thinks it should be him. Once the gun is fired, half the Cabinet and plenty of hopefuls will join in.Everyone deserves blame, including Brexiteers who assumed the game was over after their victorious out vote and abandoned the field. Remainers are at fault for refusing to accept the will of the people — and the shortcomings of their beloved EU.But it is Downing Street, and Theresa May personally, who must take responsibility. Mrs May has dreamed of being Prime Minister since she was a child.It’s a tough job. It means leading from the front, making swt decisions and rallying the country with confidence and authority in dficult times.Instead, Mrs May’s team talk like defeatists about parliamentary “arithmetic”. How can she push through a dficult Brexit against ferocious opposition without a commanding Commons majority  But who was responsible for that parliamentary arithmetic It was Theresa May alone who decided to call an unforced election and it was she who single-handedly blew it. Her only task was to deliver the referendum mandate handed to her by .million voters. She blew that, too.People knew the risks. They did not vote for us to stay half-in, half-out or to see our sovereignty handed over to foreign powers. To govern is to decide.

After all, as we remember from school, this ancient British queen rose up against the Roman Empire, winning battles, slaughtering enemies and forcing the Romans to contemplate leaving Britain all together.“But, hang on,” I replied. “Wasn’t Boudicca eventually defeated ”Whatever the details, my friend was right. It is time for Theresa May to call on her deepest reserves of defiance and stand up to the European Union.Brussels has rejected her Brexit proposals, insulted us at the recent Salzburg summit and wants to dismember the United Kingdom by effectively annexing Northern Ireland for itself.Theresa May’s respect towards the EU has been met consistently with contempt for Britain. She has wished Brussels every success, while they wish us nothing but failure and decline. She has suggested solutions while they point out problems. And she has taken her Government to the brink by proposing a future relationship that is hated by many of her own MPs and supporters.It is time, now, to stop.Her Chequers plan already goes too far. It would tie us to European laws, over which we would have no say, and force us to accept the rulings of the European Court of Justice.It would prevent us from taking our own decisions and making our economy more competitive. And it almost certainly stops us from striking our own trade deals.Worse still,the Government persists with Chequers, we will end up with something even worse: Chequers Minus, which could mean making annual payments to Brussels, complying with more EU laws and accepting liberal immigration rules that amount to continued free movement.The longer we pretend Chequers can survive, the worse the outcome will be. As we negotiate the Withdrawal Agreement, Britain should be seeking watertight assurances about our future relationship. Without them, we will sign away a £billion orce payment without any confidence we will get a fair deal for the future.But the crisis the Prime Minister described to Parliament yesterday, and which the Cabinet will discuss today, is not about Chequers, but the so-called “backstop” — what should happen to Northern Irelandthere is no eventual agreement on the future relationship.The EU’s proposition is an outrage. If there is no deal on the future relationship, they expect Northern Ireland to remain inside the Customs Union and, in effect, the single market.That would mean, in trying to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, we would create a hard border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. That’s right, a border within our own country to avoid having one with another.The backstop would mean politicians in the Republic have a say over laws in Northern Ireland, while politicians in Belfast and London would have none. And it effectively breaches the Good Friday Agreement, which demands that Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom is respected unless a majority of Northern Irish people vote for the reunication of Ireland.The one concession the EU seems willing to make is that the whole of the United Kingdom can remain inside the Customs Union, not just Northern Ireland.But it insists there can be no time limit, and no right for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from the backstop.In other words, we would be trapped inside the Customs Union — following laws over which we have no say, letting Brussels grant trading access to our market for other countries and leaving us unable to agree trade deals of our own — for ever.This, of course, has always been the EU’s game. They have cynically used the Northern Irish peace process to try to tie the whole of the United Kingdom to the EU’s rules and regulations. And in their naivety, our negotiators have walked straight into the trap.The PM needs to tell the EU to get stuffed. And she must go back to the drawing board. She must replace Chequers with an ambitious, Canada Plus, free trade agreement between the UK and the EU. She must insist that the Northern Irish solution lies with technology and policy that avoid checks at the border. And she must tear up the backstop.One alternative, still a compromise for Brexiteers like me, is to agree that the UK will remain inside the Customs Union for a period of up to five years while the appropriate systems are put into place.Critics will say the EU will never agree. Butthey cannot accept a trade deal consistent with their principles and which respects the integrity of their single market, we know they seek only a damaging deal for Britain, or no deal at all.Others will say the Government could not get this kind of plan through the Commons. But it stands a better chance than Chequers Minus.This was, in fact, the plan Theresa May first set out at Lancaster House in January .There, she warned against a Chequers-style deal, saying: “We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave” and “we will not have truly leftwe are not in control of our own laws”.And she warned against what the backstop demands. She insisted on creating “no new barriers to living and doing business within our own Union”, and warned against “an unlimited transitional status”, which she called a “kind of permanent political purgatory”.Instead, she sought “a comprehensive free trade agreement” and the freedom for “Britain to negotiate its own trade agreements” with other countries.In other words, she described the Canada Plus agreement that is prepared and drafted but gathering dust inside the Brexit Department.Many years ago, The Sun advised us to say “up yours, Delors” to a meddling European Commissioner. Today, the PM needs to find her inner Boudicca and say: “On your way, Barnier.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They got neither.Both couples claimed other commitments but, given that they all took centre stage at Harry and Meghan’s nuptials and the Beckhams also made the cut for William and Kate’s big day, perhaps they felt this wasn’t A-list enough Instead, we had to make do with, among others, models Naomi Campbell, Cara ­Delevingne and Kate Moss, X Factor judges Robbie Williams and Ayda Field, and actresses Demi Moore and Liv Tyler.Some of whom uploaded gushing videos from the event and Instagram photos of their outfits with hashtag plugs for ­ious clothing brands.At a “royal” wedding  The notoriously traditional Queen Mother must be turning in her grave.There will be the modernisers within the palace walls who regard this as “progress” for a monarchy that, as they see it, must appeal to a younger generationit is to survive.But to my mind, it’s the complete opposite.The pomp, ceremony, tradition, duty and, most importantly, ­mystique of the royals is what sustains them.This wedding — between a “Princess” who performs no royal duties and her Jack of tequila trade — has shone a ­spotlight on the blindingly obvious threat that, once the dutul Queen and Prince Philip are no longer with us, the ­“modern” monarchy will continue to make ever decreasing circles until the taxpayer finally decides, “Hang on — they’re just like us” and the game will be up.With this #royalwedding where even the bride’s mother, left, Instagrammed a designer plug “for my amazing dress” that threat has just come one step closer.RITA ORA is promoting her new album Phoenix. “It’s my first global release of an album.I’m really excited to express my music to the world,” she says.But why the seemingly ­regular need to, er, express her breasts at the same time After all, Ed Sheeran has never posed in just his kecks and he’s sold  squillion records.ANGRY passengers on a flight from London Heathrow to Istanbul intervened to stop Home Office officials from deporting Somalian Yaqub Ahmed.“I know he’s scared,” protested one, before leading a chant of: “Take him off the plane, take him off the plane.”Though probably not as scared as the -year-old girl who was gang-raped in London by Ahmed and two of his equally unsavoury friends – the crime for which he was being deported before these witless do-gooders stepped in.Pitully, the officials capitulated and Ahmed is still in this country awaiting our next move.Meanwhile, as some of the passengers virtue-signalled their liberal credentials by posting footage of the showdown, perhaps they could now be identied and charged with obstructing the course of justice Or, at the very least, be asked to welcome the delightful Mr Ahmed into their own homes until such time as his removal can be rearranged Let’s seetheir liberalism extends to putting their own teenage daughters at risk.PIZZAS and pies must shrink to tackle obesity, claim new official guidelines from Public Health England.Sigh.

I fully support DD [David Davis] as interim leader, she added.Andrea Jenkyns agreed, telling ITVs Peston: It’s ludicrous that it’s two years on and we haven’t got a deal. Extending [the transition] just kicks it into the long grass.And John Redwood said her plans would be unacceptable, saying: I dont think MPs would vote for it.Nigel Farage added: This is another betrayal of Brexit... I dont think she can survive this.He speculated it could mean British taxpayers having to pay an extra £BILLION to the EU.But Tory Deputy Chairman James Cleverly played down the suggestion of extending the transition period - pointing out that it was only a proposal from the EU.He refused to rule it out, but said Michel Barnier put forward a proposal which our Prime Minister and negotiating team will think about.The PM also held separate meetings with Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker, Emmanuel Macron and Irish PM Leo Varadkar today.But despite the high level talks, EU leaders said tonight that despite intensive negotiations there had not been enough progress between negotiators to come to a deal.They said that a November summit was off the cards for now, but stood ready to hold a December one in the hope that a deal could be sealed there instead.No had already given up any hope of forging a orce deal at the summit before it even started.The Brexiteer called the EU “a gravy train soaking us dry”.It had been billed as the “moment of truth” for an agreement before last weekend’s big row.Mrs May also asked the leaders to show “courage” to help her break the impasse.And despite talks stalling over Ireland yet again when a deal brokered by bureaucrats collapsed on Sunday, she also insisted an agreement was possible and appealed for them to come up with “creative” ways to help her.Mrs May told the leaders: We have shown we can do dficult deals together constructively. I remain confident of a good outcome.The last stage will need courage, trust and leadership on both sides.After she delivered the pitch, Mrs May was then asked to leave the summit room so her fellow national could deliberate over her words with dinner.The PM ed to the UK Representative to the EU’s official residence in Brussels for dinner alone with her aides.Under Mr Barnier’s proposal to extend the transition period, Mrs May must inagree to keep the whole of the UK in an indefinite customs union as a backstop to keep the Irish border opentrade talks to deliver another solution fail.But Mrs May has already ruled that out, and Cabinet ministers have demanded a legally binding mechanism to ensure any backstop is only temporary.Ireland’s Taoiseach Leo Varadkar gave his backing to the extension as one way of breaking the Irish border deadlock, but only under Mr Barnier’s conditions.Mr Varadkar said: Any extension to the transition period couldnt be a substitute for the backstop.We would still need to have that, but perhaps it would allow people to have greater confidence that it would never need to be invoked.”Some EU leaders began to express open doubts that Mrs May will ever be able to strike a deal with them because of Tory party turmoil over Brexit.Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaitė: We do not know what they want, they do not know themselves what they really want - thats the problem.“If you have on the other side of the table a negotiator who has no strong mandate, its very dficult to negotiate.”Ms Grybauskaitė, dubbed her country’s own ‘Iron Lady’ because of her black belt in karate, added: “The Brits must decide finally want they want, and rally behind the Prime Minister and not split, not battling, to have a joint opinion and joint stance.”But other EU leaders were more optimistic, including France’s Emmanuel Macron who said the EU would “find deals” to secure an orderly Brexit.The French president last night emerged as a key figure of support for Mrs May to break the Ireland impasse, having lead the way in torpedoing her trade deal proposals at a summit in Salzburg last month.Mr Macron was one of four EU leaders that Mrs May held one-to-one meetings with in Brussels ahead of the summit’s start.Another pivotal player, Germany’s Angela Merkel, was also supportive, saying: “We want good relations with Britain.“We would have been happythe exit deal was ready. Instead, we are  percent there.But I will tackle the issues in good spirit and try everything to find an agreement.”It also emerged tonight that Mrs May has invited  chief executives to take part in a conference call on Friday to brief them on the status of Brexit negotiations.The invitations, which were sent out today, are part of efforts by Downing Street to build a closer relationship with business.And in a blow to the PM, French officials today published a paper stating that in a No Deal scenario, British visitors to France would in principle need a visa to enter the country, and would be considered illegal immigrantsthey failed to apply for one.The document also revealed that French ministers are planning to implement new border checks the day after Brexitthe two sides fail to agree a deal.Its the first time a major European country has publicly announced plans for how it would cope with a No Deal outcome.On a crucial day in the Brexit process:At the start of todays summit, some leaders expressed optimism about the chances of a deal - Dutch PM Mark Rutte said: Im cautiously optimistic that over the coming weeks Michel Barnier and the negotiating team in the UK will come to conclusions.Angela Merkel claimed a deal was  per cent done, adding: I’m approaching this with the spirit of always trying to do everything to find an agreement.But Lithuanias president Dalia Grybauskaite said the UK had yet to agree its own negotiating position.She said Britain needs to rally behind the Prime Minister all together and not split - to have a joint opinion and joint stance.And chief negotiator Michel Barnier added: We are not there yet. Brexit must be orderly for everyone and for all the issues, including on the island of Ireland.So we need time, we need much more time, and we will continue to work in the next weeks calmly and patiently.Belgiums Charles Michel said: We are concerned because we see it is dficult in the British Parliament to have the same views on the future of the relationship between the EU and UK.The EU meeting which started today was previously earmarked as the moment when leaders would sign off an a withdrawal agreement.But talks broke down over the weekend after the EU insisted on a border backstop which could carve off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.Mrs May told a Cabinet meeting yesterday that she wont accept any deal which which breaks up the Union - or which keeps Britain tied to the EU customs union permanently.And speaking to MPs in the Commons today, the PM said: We continue to work for a good deal with the European Union - a deal that delivers on the Brexit vote but also a deal that protects jobs and livelihoods and crucially that protects the precious Union of the United Kingdom.We will not accept any proposals which would effectively break up the United Kingdom.She accused Jeremy Corbyn of preparing to betray voters by laying the ground for a second referendum on Brexit.Mrs May also rejected the Labour leaders claim that her Chequers proposals are dead after she failed to mention them by name in two recent speeches.Today Michael Gove suggested that a deal might not be signed until December - just three months before we officially quit the EU.He told a Commons committee: It might be the case - we’ve seen how European negotiations work - that progress is made at October council, progress is made at the November council, and it is even as late as the December council before a deal is done.Obviously, everyone wants the deal to be done earlier.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt claimed one of the biggest threats to Brexit is Tory MPs like Boris Johnson who refuse to back Mrs Mays approach.He told the Daily Mail: Boris is a backbencher so he is free to say exactly as he thinks.But what I would say to Boris is be careful because there is a real danger thatall of us Conservative MPs do not stand behind the Prime Minister at a moment like this, the danger is that Brexit will be derailed altogether.I am sure that this is last thing Boris wants.The pro-EU veterans made a direct appeal to politicians across the EU, asking them to back calls for a second referendum.They wrote a joint opinion piece which appeared today in a number of European newspapers.The trio said: Our domestic debate is far from over and, even at this late hour, many of us are continuing to make the case that the British public need to make the final decision once we are in possession of all the relevant facts.So we ask our European partners to be ready to give us the space and time,necessary, to make such a final decision.They accused Brexiteers of being cynical pessimists who want to get a flimsy exit deal that they would later tear up in order to impose deregulation and tax cuts.The ex-PM and two former deputies have been blasted by Brexit-backing MPs who say they are undermining Britains negotiating position."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000218240119.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"180000 brits are owed 5000 each after having their benefits underpaid by bungling officials","story":"The Government will pay an average of £, to , disabled or ill claimants who were short-changed for years.The Department for Work and Pensions announced it faces a bill of nearly £billion for the blunder -

But that may be more of an emotional impression than a rational one.During the transition period, Britain will continue to be treated asits a member of the EU even though we are officially leaving in March next year.That will mean paying in to the EU budget and remaining part of the single market and customs union - meaning continued free movement of people, and a ban on cutting new trade deals around the world.Yesterday Eurocrats asked Mrs Mayshe would consider extending the planned transition until December , a year longer than previously pencilled in.The idea is to give both sides longer to thresh out a hi-tech solution to the Irish border issue which would take away the need for checks on the island of Ireland or in the Irish Sea.But after the PM signalled she may be open to the idea, Tory MPs hit out at the desperate ploy - and even called for her to quit.Leading moderate Nick Boles, who backed Remain in the  referendum, warned Mrs May she is shedding support from her party.He told the BBC: Im afraid she is losing the confidence now of colleagues of all shades of opinion, people who have been supportive of her throughout this process.They are close to despair at the state of this negotiation because there is a fear that both the Government and the European Union are trying to run out the clock, that they are trying to leave this so late that they can credibly say there is no alternative but a no-deal Brexit and most people agree that would be chaos.That is not an acceptable way for a leader of a government to behave.He claimed another year of transition would cost the Treasury nearly £billion in additional payments to Brussels.Brexiteer Nadine Dorries called on the PM to quit rather than make more concessions to Brussels.She tweeted: If Theresa May is asking for a longer transition period, she is stalling. It’s time to stand aside and let someone who can negotiate get on with it and deliver.Jacob Rees-Mogg added: I think its a poorly thought-through idea.It could be a very expensive thing to do. The Government doesnt have endless money, it has to make choices.Is it better to give the money to the European Union, or is it better to put the money into Universal Credit Another senior Tory told The Sun: There are now billion reasons why Mrs May should go - this is not delivering the referendum in any way shape or form.Think what that £billion could be spent on at home, police, schools, more doctors. Its a shambles.And Remainers also mocked Mrs May - Labours Gareth Thomas from the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign said: The Prime Minister can give herself as much Brextra time as required but its not going to work.The Northern Ireland border issues are signicant and the stark reality is that buying a few months or even another year, albeit welcome, will not solve the problem in itself.The PMs de facto deputy David Lidington said a longer transition was in the mix but refused to confirm how much an extension would cost Britain.He said the price tag would have to be teased out during further talks with Brussels.In other Brexit developments today:Arriving for the second day of the European Council summit, Luxembourgs PM Xavier Bettel said time was running out for a Brexit deal and claimed Mrs May is under huge pressure.He said: On March , its game over. March  is the last day when the UK is a member of the EU so we have to have a deal before.We know Theresa May is in a tricky situation because she has got huge pressure in the UK and at Westminster.This afternoon Angela Merkel added: I came away from the table neither more pessimistic nor more optimisticBritain needs to find an answer - what about Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland Ex-ministers including Boris Johnson, David Davis and Iain Duncan Smith last night wrote to the PM calling on her to ditch her Chequers proposals or risk a humiliating surrender to Brussels.They said: We urge you to make clear that you will not bind the UK into the purgatory of perpetual membership of the EUs customs union, whether by a backstop or any other route.Talk of either a UK or a Northern Irish backstop is inimical to our status as a sovereign nation state."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000442566245.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"wetherspoons customer burger art ketchup","story":"Molly Napier-Doyle, , created the works of art on the distinctive Spoons floral plates using ketchup, mayonnaise, brown sauce and mustard.And a portrait of Frida Kahlo dubbed Frida KetchupThe talented teen had been eating burgers and drinking cocktails with friends in their local Wetherspoons on Holloway Road when she decided to start playing with the leftovers on a whim last week.Swapping her paintbrush for a wet paper straw and using pictures on her phone as a reference, Molly claims she painted the ironic art to give her pals and the waiters a laugh.Giving Da Vinci a run for his money, fine arts student Molly mixed leftover mayonnaise and mustard together for the Mona Lisas skin.The portrait of Mollys idol Frida Kahlo was garnished using leftover limes, tomatoes and lettuce leaves as substitutes for the Mexican artists iconic hair flowers and earrings.The Mayo Lisa and Frida Ketchup drew smiles from the server too as she cleared away their plates - and Molly claims the chefs were so impressed by her art they even sent her a fruit yoyo to say thanks.Molly, from Bolton, but now living in London, said: It was just a whim - I was having fun with my friends in a Wetherspoons and thought it would be funny for the waiters to see that when they came to collect the plates.Frida Kahlo is a face Im very familiar with because I paint her a lot and I thought that would be a fun one for me.The Mona Lisa is such an icon I thought it would be funnyit were re-created out of sauce.My friends were just laughing and supporting it.One of the servers who took it away thought it was cool as well.She was saying the kitchen staff were taking photos of it.I think it was a dferent experience painting in food.

Cox said he decided to park it up after its engine began to smoke, and denied intentionally torching it.On Wednesday, Cox told his trial he accidentally ran over victims Miss Poole and Miss Nicholls after becoming frightened by revellers threatening to batter him in his vehicle, which he claims he had driven near the crowd of people to break up the fight.But prosecutor James Wilson accused Cox of using his vehicle to deliberately run over a man who was trading blows with his friend, only to miss and repeatedly run over the two young women, aged in their early twenties, who were sitting on a kerb.Mr Wilson said: Today you say you wanted to try and break up the fight.But you know full well you werent breaking a fight up.

It is estimated that , sick and disabled people will be paid about pound.bn in benefits they were wrongly denied. The mistake means that Employment and Support Allowanceclaimants lost up to pound, each over seven years. The number falling victim has soared from , to , since errors were identied last year - and so has the bill for estimated back payments, ministers have admitted.  The back payments bill was initially pegged at poundm but has risen to poundm. The total cost of the bungle will hit pound.bn by  as a result of ongoing higher payments. Underpayments resulted from the DWPs failure to assess whether people qualied for income-related ESA rather than just the less generous contribution-based ESA. In July, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Esther McVey, facing a legal challenge, caved in to calls to refund people all the way back to . The DWP had already accepted that it wrongly underpaid disabled people switching from Incapacity Benefit to ESA and had begun the process of reimbursing claims after October .  The blunder emerged when officials found some people transferring to ESA from incapacity benefit were put on the wrong system for assessing their new payments. The bill for back payments also rose due to evidence gathered by a -strong DWP team that is still reviewing , cases. Who is affected  Some . million people were transferred from older incapacity benefits to ESA between  and . An estimated , recipients are due arrears, up from the initial estimate of ,. Those affected are largely people who converted from incapacity benefit, an old-style benefit, to the contributory version of ESA. The DWP has said it will be contacting those who are owed money and there is no need for claimants to contact the department themselves. However, critics say payments have been sluggish and some have contacted the DWP directly in a bid to speed up their case. A spokesperson for the DWP said: “Anyone affected by this error will receive all of the money they are entitled to.”  When will I be paid  The new estimates show poundm arrears will be paid to , through to April . This is for people whose cases post-date  October . Another poundm will then be paid to an estimated , in the   financial year. This is for people whose cases pre-date  October . How much am I owed  A small number of Employment and Support Allowance claimants lost up to pound, each over seven years. About , entitled to the severe disability premium were estimated to be owed around pound, each. The arrears payments, which mainly cover a period between  and , are expected to average pound, per person.  How will I be paid  Recipients can expect to receive back-dated payments within  weeks of being contacted by the DWP. Payments will come through the same way their benefits are paid - usually directly into their bank account. What about claimants who have died  Yes -your relative died while waiting for payment, you should be entitled to claim their benefits. DWP Minister Sarah Newton told the House of Commons: Tragically, people who’ve died who would have benefited from this additional payment, their families are being contacted, we are trying to find their families, so they can have that money. Will that money be paid back with interest  Its not clear. Ms Newton dodged this question when asked directly in the House of Commons on Thursday.  What are critics saying  Rob Holland, co-chair of the Disability Benefits Consortium, which represents  charities and campaign groups, said: “Close to half of those in poverty are disabled or live with a disabled family member. “In addition to making sure disabled people are paid, the Government must reverse cuts built into Universal Credit.” Labours Marsha de Cordova, shadow minister for disabled people, said recipients have been short-changed and denied the social security they were entitled to. She said: This mess is another example of how the Conservatives have created a hostile environment for sick and disabled people. The Government must ensure that disabled people who have been so unfairly treated are properly compensated. A Government that forces disabled people into debt and even makes some destitute is a disgrace.

I speak for many more of my generation than you might think. I was born in , when my country was fighting for its le against Nazi Germany and it was not clear that we would win. My father Harry was in the RAF in the Middle East. My Uncle Bob was a tail gunner in Lancasters over occupied Europe.My Uncle Jack, a Guardsman, had been invalided off the beaches at Dunkirk. Even my youthful Auntie Barbara was in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. This was total war – the Americans fighting and dying with us, for our freedom. At home it was all wartime austerity. Food and clothes were rationed. Travel was suspended. I ask you to remember because so many have either forgotten or never known the cataclysmic reality of Europe at war with itself. Remember the Blitz on London and Hull. Remember Sheffield, Coventry, Plymouth, Liverpool, Bath and York. Remember, Auschwitz, Treblinka, and the other death camps where millions of Jews were exterminated. Remember El Alamein, Tobruk, Normandy and all the battlegrounds where people gave their lives to free us from Hitler.Remember all these things and consider thoughtfully what must be done to ensure that these horrors never happen again.  The EU brought peace, trade, co-operation and freedom to travel where there had been enmity, rivalry and refugees. It is not perfect, made up of all the flaws of the people of an old, culturally and racially erse continent that historically has more often been at war than at peace. But it is nothing short of a miracle that they found the wisdom to get together in their common interest. I do not care what Theresa May brings back from Brussels, just so long as it keeps us good friends and partners with the rest of Europe. I want the peace that my father’s generation fought for to be preserved in perpetuity, for my children, and generations to come. So, when Mrs May s with her Brexit package, I look to the politicians – including those Labour MPs who have the country’s real interests at heart – to support her in the hour of the nation’s need. At this critical time it is more important to vote for a new relationship with Europe than to blindly follow the elusive dream of Jeremy Corbyn in No. The crunch is coming and it will reveal the true patriots. Because of the war I did not see my father until I was three years old. But I was lucky. At least Sgt Routledge came home. So many others didn’t.

While others will spend longer planning major renovations than ever before. The study of , adults conducted by Robert Welch found for  per cent of those polled, being middle aged simply means someone is more likely to know what they want out of le.

But during a week-long trial at Bristol Crown Court Miss Wilson was accused of developing an inappropriate relationship with the boy on a school trip to Swaziland in southern Africa. She learned yesterday she will not face a retrial over allegations she had sex with a pupil in an plane toilet.The court heard the  teacher, , lured the teenager into a toilet on-board a flight back to London in the summer of  and slept with him. But the jury failed to reach a verdict and the Crown Prosecution Service announced on Wednesday it would not pursue a retrial.  Despite having no criminal stain on her character, her career in teaching appears to be all but over, with the evidence showing an inappropriate relationship with a teenage pupil she had messaged more than  times. Its a far cry from her early years which pointed towards a brilliant career ahead - she was someone regarded as a fine and talented teacher by parents and colleagues. According to the Daily Mail, her early le was marked by tragedy when her father Barry Wood suffered serious injuries in a motorbike accident just a day before she turned four. He died days after his daughters birthday in . She was raised by her mum, the newspaper reports, in a terraced house in the former mill community of Silsden, West Yorkshire. When her mother married Stuart Wilson, Ellie took his surname.  A friend from Miss Wilsons years at South Craven School in Cross Hills told the Mail: School work was something Ellie found extremely easy, but she wasn’t remotely practical. She stuck out wherever she went with her height and blonde hair, but at the same time she was quite goofy and gawky. She was obsessed with science and won an Ogden Trust prize for being top of her year in physics before gaining six A*s, three As and a B in her GCSEs in . They were reportedly the second best results in her year and Ellie was spoken about in glowing terms in the local newspaper. Her mother said at the time:I expected good results, but not this good. I am very proud. Miss Wilson went on to study five A-levels — two more than most of her peers.  It was aged  she had her first brush with the law. She appeared in court after knocking down a teaching assistant at the school in her car in June  while looking for a parking space, according to local news reports. The woman suffered a fractured knee, broken finger and badly grazed her face.Miss Wilson pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention. She said it had been raining hard at the time and she had not seen the woman. Skipton magistrates imposed six penalty points on her licence and fined her pound. She was also ordered to pay pound costs and a pound victim surcharge. Despite this mark on her record she took a degree in experimental physics at the University of York, graduating with first class honours in . She then qualied as a teacher. Within a year at a secondary school in Bristol she had been promoted to head of Key Stage Four.  The headteacher at the school - which cannot be named for legal reasons - said: She was an excellent teacher — incredibly hard working. She taught engaging lessons and she was popular among colleagues, students and parents. Unusually, I had parents emailing me to thank her for the work she’d done with their son or daughter. But in the summer of  her blooming career took a dramatic turn. Evidence heard during her trial suggested that Miss Wilson was obsessed with the boy she was accusing of sleeping with. It emerged during the trial, for example, that she had exchanged some  texts, calls and multimedia messages with the pupil, who had her saved in his phone under the moniker Smurfette. Most of these were deleted before the police could retrieve them. Having sex with the boy in the plane toilet was not the only illicit behaviour alleged by the prosecution. After the trip to Swaziland, Miss Wilson was alleged to have had sexual contact with the boy on three further occasions — once in his bedroom after lunch at Nando’s and again on day trips the pair went on to Tintern Abbey in Monmouthshire and Ashton Court Estate, a country park in Bristol. Miss Wilson admitted in court she met the pupil on these occasions - and that she had texted him almost daily over that summer.  But she said the meetings were innocent and that her relationship with Andrew Hall was in trouble, with the couple rarely having sex. The prosecution alleged she told the boy she was pregnant and her plans to have an abortion. Prosecutor Virginia Cornwall showed jurors a long note the boy had written on his phone about the termination. Did you want me to have no choice to kill my own child  it read. Why are you trying to f***ing kill me  You took my happiness, you took my dream, you took my confidence  Those times on the grass in the summer laughing... kissing, touching me, telling me you love me. Soon the rumour mill at the school went into overdrive with the pupils parents and staff quickly becoming involved as his story came out: that he and Miss Wilson had joined the Mile High Club on the A Airbus on the flight back to the UK. Miss Wilson soon found herself being blackmailed.  In February  she received an email which read: I know about you and [the boy]. Wouldn’t want that coming out, would we. I have a deal, replyyou’re interested. Yours, anonymous. The pupil attached a picture of his genitals. But instead of reporting it to the headteacher, she replied over the course of two days. But the pressure got too much for her. She broke down and told the teacher of being blackmailed. The messages were traced to a pupil, who was removed from the school. They triggered the inquiry which led to Wilson being dismissed in May . She was banned from teaching by a tribunal in July . In her police interview she said the boys story sounded like some weird porn film.  There were two versions of what happened on that British Airways flight from Johannasburg to London. The first was given by the pupil who said Miss Wilson had kissed him and touched him intimately before luring him into the toilet, where they had had drunken sex. This sexual encounter, the pupil alleged, resulted in Miss Wilson falling pregnant and subsequently having a termination. The second was given by Miss Wilson, who said that she had watched Disney’s Cinderella when she wasn’t attending to a number of pupils suffering from food poisoning - and that nothing inappropriate happened. It was pointed out during the trial her  height would have made it very dficult to have sex within a confined aircraft cubicle. Her lace-up hiking boots would also have hindered her. Last week her week-long court case ended in a mistrial with a hung jury unable to decideshe was guilty or not. Every day at Bristol Crown Court she walked in, hand in hand, with her new boyfriend -year-old Josh Hawkins.

Asian hornets, native to China, feed on bees and wasps and can be about the same size as baby mice.They can grow to around an inch long and the latest sightings in Kent have sparked fears because only a couple of hornets could kill an entire hive of bees.The sighting on Monday in Kent has prompted a government warning for people to be vigilant.  Chief plant health officer Nicola Spence, from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs , urged people to report any potential cases of Asian hornets. She said: “By ensuring we are alerted to possible sightings as early as possible, we can take swt and effective action to stamp out the threat posed by Asian hornets. “While the Asian hornet poses no greater risk to human health than a bee, we recognise the damage they can cause to honey bee colonies and other beneficial insects. “Please continue to look out for any Asian hornets andyou think you’ve spotted one report your sighting through the Asian hornet app or online.”  The National Bee Unit is investigating the case in Kent and will be providing updates. A spokesperson said: “The hornets have been seen foraging on Ivy. “Please keep up your vigilance by continuing to monitor for any hornet activity, especially on flowering forage. Further information will become available as and when the situation develops.  Two Asian hornets were identied on the nature reserve on Monday and caught by the Dungeness Bird Observation. The bee-hunting insects arrived in France in  where they spread rapidly and have destroyed entire insect colonies including the European honey bee. Experts fearAsian hornet queens survive the winter, they will emerge to create new colonies and work has already begun to track down and destroy their nests. The worker hornets measure about  mm inand have distinctive yellow legs, a dark velvety body and a yellow or orange band on the fourth abdomen section. Defra is urging ing holidaymakers to check their luggage before entering the UK to help minimise the risk to bees.  A spokesperson said: “There have been cases where Asian hornets have been found in bags or camping equipment of travellers ing from those countries, particularly in spring and late autumn. “Before ing to the UK you should check your luggage, especiallyit’s been kept outside during your trip. “If you do spot an Asian hornet on yourto the UK you should report it with the dates and places you went on holiday, and ideally a photo of the insect.

According to a royal expert, even second-in-line to the thrown Prince William and we Kate Middleton dont legally have full custody of their three children - Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. This is because the family has an agreement with the Queen , which means she is granted full legal custody over all minor royals. Royal expert Marlene Koenig explained the rule to the Sun Online .She said: The sovereign has legal custody of the minor grandchildren.  Legislation passed during the reign of George I. It was known as The Grand Opinion for the Prerogative Concerning the Royal Family and it was about the King’s control over the education, the raising and the marriage of his grandchildren. He did it because he had a very poor relationship with his son, the future King George II, so they had this law passed that meant the King wasof his grandchildren. The law dates back more than  years to , a time when the monarchs right of supervision extended to his grandchildren and this right of right belongs to His Majesty, King of the Realm, even during their father’s letime. The Queen also had full custody of William and Harry when they were younger.This fact first came to light when Prince Charles and Princess Diana got orced in . In the couples orce agreement there was no mention of custody arrangements for the children, despite arrangements being made. This was because neither parent had full custody, instead this belonged to the Queen. This meant Charles and Diana had to get the Queens permission before doing simple things with their children, such as going on holiday. Marlene confirmed that the rule still exists today and technically the parents need the Queens permission to take their children out of the country. She added that despite this, the Queen is respectful of the wishes of the parents and wouldnt push her views upon them.

Ashleigh, mum of Edie Molyneux, posted the devastating image on Facebook in order to raise awareness of the condition.Edie, four, is battling Dfuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma , the Liverpool Echo reports.This is an aggressive, and ultimately fatal growth at the base of her brain. The tumour’s location in the centre of the brain means it cannot be surgically removed. And in the UK, chemotherapy is not an option because the levels needed to treat this tumour would poison the rest of the body. So little Edie has to travel all over the world with her family to receive treatment.Ashleighs post, on The Spider-Ede Appeal Facebook page, shows her crying in the foreground as her little girl lies on a hospital bed behind her, hooked to a ventilator.

The ventilator was turned up and she was given a check over. She had become limp and unresponsive. The doctors took her for a CT scan, the initial thought was that there may be a bleed on the brain. I never thought I’d say “unfortunately there is no bleed on the brain. The only visible culprit is the Tumour.

Shoppers said the model had hardly the average sized bod and didnt reflect the firms customer base. An eating disorder charity says its time for companies such as Topshop to give in to public pressure and show models of all dferent sizes. One Twitter user wrote: How are you supposed to imagine your averagely sized body in clothes when the models look like this @Topshop.Nothing against the model she is beaut, Id love to look like this but hardly the average sized bod  Another young woman commented: Lol. Boobs not allowed in that dress! Rebecca Field, a spokeswoman for eating disorder charity Beat, said that it was time companies like Topshop bowed to pressure and showed people of all dferent sizes.  She said: The idealisation of thinness that is often presented by the fashion industry can be a key factor in exacerbating the illness. Fashion retailers should recognise and respect the ersity in peoples natural body shapes and sizes. Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses with multiple causes, so pressure to fit certain size clothes would never be the sole and direct reason for someone developing one. This isnt the first time that Topshop has come under fire for its adverts or mannequins.  In , the London-based firm had to remove all of its skinny mannequins after there was an outcry online about the famine victim dummies. Parents were concerned about the mannequins promoting unattainable figures for young girls. Online retailers have began using bigger models for their campaigns and have even created Curve ranges for their brand.

But for some owners of timeshares at them theyre a seemingly inescapable hellish circle of never ending annual fees for resorts they no longer use. Ive heard from a string of owners who are desperate to sell their weeks, paying International Timeshare Refund Action Limitedto help them find a way out. One customer is Christine Carmichael, who wants shot of a MGM Muthu Club Infiniti timeshare in Albufiera, Portugal. Bought in , its annual charges are now around pound. Christine decided to sell when her husband George died in , paying ITRA pound,. Since shes not on the internet, her daughter Laura is helping. “So far ITRA have done very little, getting me to do most of their work,” Laura says. “The last I heard was that my mother had signed some legal documents and nothing more since, that was well over a year ago. “My mother has since had demand letters for the payment of her annual fees. “She simply cannot afford to pay these fees and she no longer can travel abroad. I am tired of emailing ITRA and getting no response.”  Colin and Gail Mackay wanted to sell their Diamond International timeshare in Lanzarote in the Canary Islands when the yearly management fee reached around pound, and they couldnt get their preferred holiday dates. “ITRA said that we would not get out of the agreement by ourselves,” says Colin, from Newcastle. “The agent stated that our children would still be liable for payment of fees after our deaths because the agreement was for  years. They also said they would get compensation for potential mis-selling of agreement.” The couple paid ITRA pound, in May  but say: “ITRAs only input was a standard letter that we modied.”  Julia and Michael King are trying to get rid of a Club La Costa timeshare in Tenere. “We paid ITRA over pound,, this was over two years ago,” says Julie, from Loddiswell, Devon.  “When I contact them they seem to palm us off saying that they have submitted papers to court are waiting for a court case, which supposedly was heard on  December last year. “We have contacted ITRA to cancel as we were no nearer getting a result than when we signed up with them.”  Another unhappy couple is Anthony and Maggie Holloway from Broom, Warwickshire. They own two timeshares, one in Scotland, the other in Kissimmee, Florida, and paid ITRA just under pound, in  to dispose of them. “After four years I am now informed that I still own the week in Scotland and am therefore liable for maintenance arrears of pound,” said Anthony. “It has threatened court action via their solicitor for recovery of the arrears.  “I had been assured by ITRA that they would be taking charge of all demands being made by the management companies.” Theyre in the dark about the Florida timeshare, despite sending notarised documents by registered post to an address in the USA in September , as requested. When I phoned ITRA for a progress report approximately  Months later we were informed by them that the address had no record of the receipt for the documents, Anthony said. Further enquiries by myself by using the postal tracking service showed the documents were delivered to and signed for at the address.  I informed ITRA of this and gave them the details. ITRA said they would follow this up and get back to me. They never did, that was the last we heard from them. ITRA, which claims to have helped thousands of timeshare owners, gives a PO box in Gibraltar as its head office. Heres what it said about the cases Ive cited: *Christine Carmichael - This case was handed over to our collaborating UK Law firm Messrs Pinder Reaux. The lawyer that is looking into this case has been travelling and we have not been informed about the status of this case at this present time. *Colin and Gail MacKay - This case was handed over to our collaborating UK Law firm Messrs Pinder Reaux. The lawyer that is looking into this case has been travelling and we have not been informed about the status of this case at this present time. *Julia and Michael King- they requested our Spanish lawyers stop pursuing their case. *Anthony and Maggie Holloway - We engaged M Legal to write to the Scottish resort but M Legal have not informed usthey have received a response to the letters sent at this present time. As far as the couples Florida resort is concerned We are currently investigating this matter with the agents that were involved with this case. The statement also explained that its business is being wound down because “ITRAs principal Mr Peter Utal fell very ill two and a half years ago”.

Exacta Weather forecaster James Madden told the Daily Star : Temperatures will drop and the risk of snow will rise considerably towards the end of this month and into the start of November. There is a chance we could see blizzards developing over higher ground particularly in northern parts of the country. Even parts of central and southern England may be at risk of some wintry weather during the final part of this month although here it is not expected to be as signicant. Scotland will get the heaviest snowfall this month, WeatherAction forecaster Piers Corbyn claimed. And its time to layer up as temperatures will plunge below zero as early as next week. Some forecasters say November will likely be colder than usual and snow or snow showers arent out of the question in many places. Britons woke up to frost and fog in many places today as temperatures dropped to -C, with the morning mist particularly heavy in parts of East Anglia. Katesbridge in Co Down, Northern Ireland, was one of the coldest spots at -C. It was one of the coldest temperatures of the season so far, and its a sign of things to come next week and next month. High pressure is set to bring in colder air from the north, making snow a possibility over especially in the north east. WeatherAction says Britain could be gripped by freezing temperatures for four months due to a polar vortex and could get so low they could break records in October.However, the Met Office believes there is unlikely to be snow in England in October, though there may be overnight frosts.A Met Office spokesperson told Bristol Live : There is, as always at this time of year, a chance there may be some snow over high ground in Scotland and to lower levels in the far north of Scotland.Snow is regularly seen over higher ground in Scotland from September onwards. However, as far as the chance of snow in [the south of England] in October is concerned for the rest of the month the weather looks fairly typical for the time of year. It is likely to stay generally dry and bright in the south interspersed with spells of more wet and windy weather. Temperatures ying around average, but becoming colder as we go through the month with an increasing risk of overnight frosts and fog. On the whole temperatures are likely to be rather cold, but some brief milder spells are also possible.

Much-loved naturalist Sir David Attenborough came third thanks to his encyclopaedic knowledge of nature. Tennis legends, Roger Federer and Serena Williams came fourth and fth respectively.  Overall the poll produced a top  of living beings who possess attributes most of us can only dream of having. The study was carried out to mark theof The Gted which continues on Sundays at pm on FOX. To coincide with the poll, FOX teamed up with Professor of Physiology and former Olympian Greg Whyte OBE, to create an anatomical blueprint made from the qualities possessed by real-le superhumans. Whyte OBE, analysed the anatomy and neurological make up of over  real le superhumans. He then worked with digital illustrator Chris Hart and used the results of his analysis to build a biological structure that takes into account everything from brain processing time, to physical attributes and motor s.  Whyte concluded the ultimate superhuman is likely to have legs like Usain Bolt, with fast-twitch muscle fibres that provide the ability to accelerate faster than . per cent of the population. They would have the vision of Veronica Seider who has the strongest eyesight in the world. Seider is able to distinguish detail from up to a mile away and her sight is  times better than the average person. The ultimate superhuman also has the lungs of former rower, Sir Steve Redgrave CBE, the abs of boxer Anthony Joshua OBE and the arms of record-breaking swimmer Michael Phelps. Whyte who is a currently a professor in Applied Sport  Exercise Science at Liverpool John Moores University and a UK authority on Exercise Physiology, said: ‘’Many people possess superhuman powers without even knowing it. ‘’And we’ve seen this reflected in some of the characters of The Gted, who have to discover and accept their powers. ‘’Getting to superhuman status is undeniably a combination of nature and nurture it’s not only genetic makeup, but psychology, drive, determination and external environment that come together to create a superhuman.  ‘’It’s the perfect combination of all of these iables that’s led to the incredible examples included within the ultimate superhuman.” The study also found  per cent grew up wishing they had incredible powers, and half of us still wish we possessed extraordinary abilities.

The -year-old university student wrote on Facebook that she had just  hours to find a couple prepared to get married at the wedding venue. She was inundated with messages from hundreds of husbands and brides-to-be desperate to win her big day.  After whittling down the applicants to a shortlist of , Kolbie, from Lindale in Texas, US, plucked lucky winner Halie Hipsher, , out of a hat. Insurance worker Halies story stood out because her grandfather Edwin Truett Hipsher, , is suffering from pancreatic cancer and doesnt have long to live. Halie said: As he is nearing the closing of his chapter this donation will put us a year ahead of schedule and he will be able to attend. The mother of seven-month-old Riley will wed Matthew Jones, , an oil field worker, at the Belle Vue wedding venue in Tyler, Texas, this Saturday. And touchingly, Kolbie will be guest of honour.

The venue told me that I could still get married there at some point in the future and keep my booking but by that point I thought, Id like another couple to enjoy it. Skylar and I are still really good friends and he was on board with me donating the venue. She took to social media to find a betrothed couple to take the booking on October .  The elementary education major wrote on Facebook on Sunday: With my engagement ending, Ive come to find tremendous peace knowing that I did the right thing for both of us. With that being said, now I want to do the right thing by others and let some good come out of this decision.

I have partnered with the venue and we are both excited to seewe can help a couple in need of making their wedding that much more beautul with a free venue.  This is for couples who cant afford a fancy venue or who are spending too much money on their kids to be able to afford a nice wedding. This is for couples who love each other and will continue to choose each other for the rest of their lives. Kolbie asked husbands and brides-to-be to send her details of their relationship and was followed with heartfelt messages from couples eager to tie the knot. Her generosity was soon matched by a local photographer, caterer, florist, hair stylist and makeup artist who offered their services to the winning couple. She said: I couldnt even count the messages, I got hundreds and hundreds. I stayed up until am reading them all.  I didnt think Id have to choose from so many people. It was dficult to compare their stories. I knew Id never be able to decide so I picked the ones that stood out and wrote them down. I reached out to them all to make sure they were  per cent sure that they could get married in a week. She compiled a shortlist of  couples and placed their names in a bowl before plucking Halies name out of the bowl on Monday. Halie said: Thank you. I cant say that enough.

The -year-old has been charged with first-degree murder and is in custody. The horric death happened in Boli County, Mississippi.  Police say it not clear whether the toddler was already dead before she was placed in the oven. Local Sherf Kevin Williams told US news site WREG: “While the official cause of death is still under investigation, authorities have reason to believe the child was stabbed and burnt. “Dark days such as these can only be brightened when justice has been served. He added: “I’ve been in law enforcement a long time,  years almost. “This is one of the most horrible things I’ve ever seen.” Royalty’s mother, Veronica Jones, has started a GoFundMe page asking for help with funeral and burial experiences for her little girl. She wrote: My daughter would have been  months old on October , .  Royalty was so beautul  I loved her more than anything in the world. Im starting this gofundme to take care of the funeral arrangements of Royalty Marie Floyd. Anything that is giving will deeply appreciated. Neighbours have also expressed their disbelief at the horric news. “It just shocked everybody,“ said neighbour Earlean Carter. “I thought the house was empty. I didn’t know no one lived there.” Another neighbour, Wesley Nichols, added: “How can you do a child like that  They’re innocent.” It’s understood that the little girl lived in the house with her grandmother. Police haven’t established a motive for the alleged murder. “We are trying to figure that out ourselves. We have no idea at this point,” Sherf Williams said.

Turkish authorities who are looking for the dissident and US resident are facing the possibility that his body may never be found. Mr Khashoggi was last seen inside Saudi Arabias consulate in Istanbul more than two weeks ago. It is claimed he was butchered alive and decapitated by a -member hit squad that included an autopsy expert who once studied in Glasgow.  A source told Sky News that one line of inquiry is that a very fast-acting chemical acid was used to dissolve the journalists body parts after he was murdered. The theory emerged as Mr Khashoggis chilling final column was published by the Washington Post. His column warned that Middle Eastern governments have free rein to silence the media, and it came after a gruesome account in Turkeys Yeni Safak newspaper claimed that Saudi officials cut off his fingers and then decapitated him inside the consulate while his fiancee waited outside.  The Washington Post said it received Mr Khashoggis column from his assistant a day after he was reported missing. Titled Jamal Khashoggi: What the Arab world needs most is free expression, the column condemns the crackdown on journalists by Arab governments and the failure of the international community to respond. Mr Khashoggi cited his friend and fellow Saudi writer, Saleh al-Shehi, who was jailed for five years after criticising the Saudi establishment, and the Egyptian governments seizure of the entire print run of the al-Masry al Youm newspaper.  Mr Khashoggi, last seen on October , wrote: These actions no longer carry the consequence of a backlash from the international community. Instead, these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence. As a result, Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate. The column included a note from Karen Attiah, the Posts global opinions editor, who said she received the column from Khashoggi’s translator and assistant the day after he was reported missing in Istanbul. She wrote: The Post held off publishing it because we hoped Jamal would come back to us so that he and I could edit it together.  Now I have to accept: That is not going to happen. This is the last piece of his I will edit for The Post. Ms Attiah praised Mr Khashoggi for his commitment and passion for freedom in the Arab world, adding: A freedom he apparently gave his le for. The Saudi government, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has denied any involvement in Mr Khashoggis disappearance. Turkish sources have told Reuters that investigators have an audio recording indicating Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate. On Thursday, Turkish crime scene investigators left the consulate after searching the premises and consular vehicles, a witness told Reuters. Authorities have also searched the Saudi consuls residence, where it is alleged the journalists remains were taken to. US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he did not want to abandon ally Saudi Arabia over Mr Khashoggis disappearance. He has asked for audio recordings Turkish sources say indicate the journalist was killed by Saudi agents, and he plans to meet on Thursday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who visited Saudi Arabia and Turkey earlier this week.

I thought it was a good performance, especially in the first half.“It didn’t feel like a - defeat, so it was a bit disappointing coming off with that scoreline but it was good to get the goal at the end.”The former Partick Thistle and Wigan centre-half has been pleased with his own progress in the blue of Scotland lately after picking up his third cap.He hopes that, alongside defensive partner McKenna, there are many more to come in the months and years ahead as Alex McLeish’s side look to get their Nations League campaign back on track as they travel to Albania and Israel come to Hampden next month.“In my first two caps I think I played very well and again last night, apart from near the end where I gave the ball away and it led to a goal, I thought I had a solid performance.“I’m taking everything in my stride, trying to keep learning and, hopefully, building on it. Scott’s a talented player and it’s good to see that kind of talent coming through the Scotland ranks. We work well as a partnership and we work well with each other so, hopefully, that can grow.“With the facilities, the coaching staff and the players around you at Celtic and with Scotland you’re always going to kick on as long as you put the work in, which I’m doing.

But, to provide an uninterrupted supply of great tasting, high quality water is no mean feat.Water from our reservoirs is piped to one of  water treatment works dotted around the country before being sent along Scottish Water’s massive network of pipes – that stretch more than , miles across theand breadth of Scotland – to business premises and homes just like yours. This is a process that happens every minute of the day, every day of the year.Our drinking water is quality tested every two minutes on average, making it “the most tested water in the world”, according to Scottish Water’s chief scientist Elise Cartmell. And it is the highest quality it has ever been, with .% of tests taken at customers’ taps complying with strict regulatory standards.As one of Scotland’s biggest businesses, Scottish Water has a team of employees all playing a part in providing water to its five million customers.One important member of the team behind our taps is Kes Juskowiak from Fe. As a water operations manager at Scottish Water, he is accountable for all the water that travels from source to the taps of more than one million people in Scotland and has  water treatment works under his supervision.Fer Kes covers a large geographical area north of the Forth and east of the A, working across Fe, Tayside, Angus and Aberdeenshire, and as far north as Orkney and Shetland. And he, like the -strong team behind him, is passionate about helping to deliver . billion litres of world-class water to customers across Scotland every day.The former laboratory scientist, who used to test the water we drink before it arrived in our taps, said: “The team’s primary responsibility is to ensure the water quality is good and remains good, that’s why we go to work every day.“At the risk of sounding cheesy, I have a great team and they all care about the water quality. We also make sure our customers get their water at all times, sothere’s an interruption, I need to make sure that the impact to customers in minimised. We get calls throughout the night – so you can’t do this jobyou don’t care.”The water supply for Tayside comes from Backwater, the fourth largest reservoir in Scotland, which has a peak capacity of nearly  million cubic metres, and has the sole purpose of providing drinking water.Once it leaves Backwater, it is treated at Clatto or Whitehillocks water treatment works before travelling along a network of underground pipes and reaching our taps.Of course, providing high-quality drinking water doesn’t happen by magic. Behind the scenes a huge round-the-clock monitoring, testing and sampling operation is going on in both Scottish Water’s laboratories – in Edinburgh and Inverness.Each day hundreds of samples from reservoirs, treatment works and customers’ taps go through rigorous tests, to ensure the water we receive is the freshest, clearest and best-tasting as it can be. Nothing is left to chance as a team of tasters check for any abnormal odours or flavours on their noses and tongues.After the taste tests, samples go to a lab for further analysis in a bid to detect any unwanted bacteria.In addition to the testing carried out by trained staff, technology is also used to continuously monitor the water flowing through the miles of pipes beneath us.Across Courier country, Mr Juskowiak is part of this process and he explained how monitors throughout the network are also making sure the quality of our drinking water remains high.He said: “We live in a modern world where we rely on instrumentation  days a year,  hours a day. Our ICCmonitors Scotland’s water constantly.“We have instruments everywhere – in water treatment works, distribution systems, in pipes and storage tanks – which indicatethere is aluminium, turbidity, colour or changes in chlorine levels. The instruments act as early warnings.“And we set the limits very low so that we can get to the problem as early as possible and recty it. My team would respond to any issues that are detected and flagged up by the ICC, and I would respondthere is a major incident.”In a bid to highlight the vital role water plays in our lives, and the high quality, great tasting water available from the tap in Scotland, Scottish Water has launched a campaign called Your Water Your Le. The campaign, which was launched in June , is encouraging more Scots to “top up from the tap”, something Kes and his colleagues across the business already do.He added: “I am a Scottish Water customer, as well as an employee, and I know where my water comes from and the efforts the guys and girls put in to making sure it is high quality and tastes good.“Not only does it taste great, the water that comes from our taps is good for you, hydrates you and it also good for the environment as well as your pocket.“Tap water also has a low carbon impact, so drinking it means you are also looking after the environment as we don’t have lorries shipping bottles of water all over the country. Topping up from the tap with a reusable container also means there is no plastic pollution.“We’re all proud to do the job we do, despite its challenges. During the Beast from the East, one of my team members spent six hours digging through the snow to come in to work – that’s the level of dedication from staff.”Business owners in Dundee are throwing their weight behind the Your Water Your Le campaign encouraging customers to top up from the tap for the sake of the environment.Business woman Heather Sharp pictured above, who co-owns Coffee  Co with husband Kevin Judge, already offers tap water to customers who visit their Reform Street independent coffee shop.She said: “We offer free water with ice and lemon it’s on display for the customers to come in and help themselves – it’s literally ‘on tap’. It’s a benefit to us that the customers are happy, it’s a simple as that.”Husband Kevin – who was in the RAF at Leuchars – is a big fan of Scotland’s tap water.He said: “Scottish water is high quality – we all know that – and we will do anything we can to encourage drinking it. Besides tasting good, it is also free, but more importantly, drinking tap water means you are not buying plastic bottles and instead recycling refillable bottles to top up with.“We are here for the benefit of our customers. Some of them do come in with their bottles and ask for tap water, they could be tourists or locals. Other customers might not ask because they think it is bit cheeky, but we are more than happy to do it.”He laughed: “Of course, we do still stock bottled water as there is a customer demand for it, but we also offer the same thing – for free!”Keen to encourage other local cafes, restaurants and bars to do the same, Heather added: “I think from a conservation point of view, and from a business point of view, more cafes should be doing this because anything that benefits the customer will benefit the business.”From keeping cash in our pockets to helping protect the environment, there are many great reasons to top up with tap water at home, at work and when we’re out and about. Here, we round up just a few of them... SAVE MONEYLittle changes can lead to big savings. On average a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap could save £. a day – that’s nearly £ a year.

I’m really thankful to him for giving me it and, hopefully, I took it and did well.“Now we want to follow it up with another good performance against Inverness this week.”McMullan’s sparkling display saw him at the centre of much of United’s attacking display. He also grabbed an assist for the winning goal when Jags keeper Cammy Bell couldn’t hold his shot, allowing Pavol Safranko to net the rebound, making a mockery of last month’s revelation that United were willing to let him go in the summer.At the time he stated his plan was to get his head down and work hard to get back in the side before re-assessing his position during the January transfer window, when he’d be into the last six months of his contract.On that score, nothing has changed but, having been given his chance by the new boss, his hope is regular involvement from now on will see the matter resolved by a new deal at United.And he knows the best way to earn that is via regular performances like his last.“I’ve always had the belief in my ability and what I have to do is keep trying to play well.“On Saturday the manager gave me a more central role and it was good fun. You get a wee bit more of the ball and, when you do get on it, you can go both ways and I enjoyed that.”Even after just a few days working with Neilson, the -year-old is firm in his belief, what’s about to unfold at Tannadice is something every player there will want to be part of.“I think Saturday was a sign of things to come and we’re only going to get better from now on.“All the boys are champing at the bit to be involved and that’s definitely what you want because we’ve got a lot of good players here.“Right from the start on Saturday I thought we looked really good, we were creating chances. One thing where we were maybe lacking was converting them and it’s something we can work on.“But we did create a few, maybe should have had another couple of goals and we had one that was just offside as well and it’s good we’re making them.“We had to battle for the last  minutes or so and you do get a bit nervy when they pull a goal back and because it’s late on you go a bit more defensive.“Probably the fact we’d been so much on top makes you more anxious because you don’t want to throw away two points but we stuck together and saw the game out.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sunderland target glen kamara could be bound for euros after scoring first finland goal","story":"Dundee midfielder Glen Kamara could be on his way to the next Euros after helping Finland to another impressive victory.Kamara’s last-minute goal on Monday night – his first for his country – clinched a - victory over Greece in the Ratina Stadium in Tampere.It leaves the Finns with a perfect record after four games and just needing a single point from their final two matches to confirm they’ll top their four-team group.The -year-old – linked with Sunderland at the weekend – came on as a second half sub in a - win over Estonia on Friday night before getting the full  minutes against the Greeks.As well as more than playing his part in helping his nation to their latest successes, that game time should be of benefit to Dundee.Kamara, last season’s star man at Dens Park, has been struggling with an ankle problem since July.He has been back for the Dark Blues’ last three league outings and will have benefited from the extra action while most of his clubmates were having the weekend off.Kamara will be back in time to complete preparations for Saturday’s trip to face in-form Livingston, as should Benjamin Kallman.The striker has also been back in Finland, with their U  squad.They are due in European Championship action against Lithuania tonight.The -year-old wasn’t involved when the Finns, who have no chance of qualying, went down in a home clash with Georgia at the end of last week."},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie dundee united fans right to be smiling at clubs new beginning","story":"If there’s a group of fans in the country who don’t need warned about  dawns, it has to be those at Dundee United.Since their team was relegated the best part of two-and-a-half years ago, Arabs have seen things look good for a time under Ray McKinnon and the same thing repeated under Csaba Laszlo.In the months that followed, however, optimism turned to frustration as the Tangerines went reasonably close to promotion back to the Premiership, but ultimately failed to secure it.Particularly in the case of McKinnon, that was not all his fault, and with hindsight he should probably have been given more time to get United back up to the top ision.That’s a story for another day as now the focus among fans is very much on how Robbie Neilson, their club’s fth manager in three years, is going to do.Past early promise that led to heartache, however, is why, despite an excellent opening victory against Partick Thistle at Firhill on Saturday, many will remain cautious and not yet be getting carried away about what the new gaffer is going to achieve.That’s understandable and right, because never mind once, this is a case of twice bitten, third time shy.Fans have the right to wait for events of the coming months to unfold before decidingNeilson, while without question the obvious choice as manager, is indeed the man to lead United back to the Premiership.What they can be is encouraged by the start he made at Thistle. For the first time in a while, there was a spark and energy about the team that suggests they have the quality to mount a strong and successful promotion challenge.Having suggested that, through no fault of Neilson or his players, this was maybe not the best game on which to judge them.While United’s play for most of the proceedings was excellent, there is no doubt in Thistle they were facing a beleaguered outfit that looks to still be coming to terms with a relegation.Two games against the Tangerines this season have seen them well-beaten and fortunate the margin of their defeats were not considerably greater. They are in the process of finding a new manager to replace Alan Archibald and it’s clear the man who comes in has a very big job on his hands.As the old adage goes, however, Neilson and his players could only beat what was put in front of them and in his first game in charge victory was achieved in some style.And aspects of the performance mean Arabs do have good reason to feel optimistic about their team’s prospects.After just a few days working with the new boss, Saturday saw a United team that looked reinvigorated and one that, apparently, had a clear idea of what the game plan was. Too often that was not the case under his predecessor Laszlo.That produced a top performance and fine inidual displays, not least from man-of-the-match Paul McMullan.Less than two months ago it appeared his time at Tannadice could be up. On the evidence of his display at Thistle, the former Scotland U  could now be ready to show why McKinnon battled so hard to get him.Andthe work he, and others, did on the ball gave plenty of reason to look forward to the games that lie ahead, so too did the ferocious way the entire team battled to get it back when Partick had possession.Particularly under Laszlo, opposing teams were given too much time in possession, but now United look like a side that will get the ball back quickly.It’s why, while not getting ahead of themselves, United fans can again feel hopeful about their team."},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie this is why dundees neil mccann experiment went horribly wrong","story":"That Neil McCann’s turbulent time as Dundee manager has ended can’t come as a surprise after what’s been a disastrous start to the season.And it’s fair to say his reign will go down as an experiment, however bold and well-thought out, that went horribly wrong.When the former Dens favourite was appointed manager on a temporary basis following Paul Hartley’s sacking in April last year, a few eyebrows were raised.Although McCann had the coaching qualications required, the fact was, apart from a brief spell as first-team coach at Dunfermline when more often than not he couldn’t attend games, he had no managerial experience.He was, of course, still very much in the football public’s eye via his work as Sky TV’s top Scottish football pundit.And a very good job he did, talking eloquently and providing expert analysis of the satellite broadcaster’s coverage of the game north of the border.As most managers will tell you, in football, theory and practice are two very dferent things. So it’s proved with the former Scotland star at Dens Park.That he had very definite ideas on how the game should be played was clear, as was the fact he was unlikely to change them.He demanded his team focused on a passing game all over the pitch, making it clear he’d accept responsibilityit meant risks taken in playing the ball out from the back at times led to goals being conceded. Inevitably it did.In fairness to McCann, his arrival did bring about a speedy and necessary improvement and wins over Motherwell and Kilmarnock followed by a draw with Ross County were enough to save the team from relegation in the   season.Two defeats would follow before the end of the campaign and while they were largely irrelevant to a relieved support, they did perhaps suggest to the caretaker boss that, long-term, the changes he wanted to make were going to be too big an ask.That led to a confusing summer that initially saw him announce he did not want the job, moves be made for then-St Mirren boss Jack Ross, before McCann had a change of mind and was appointed on a permanent basis.Crucially, that saw time wasted in undertaking what was a clearly necessary rebuilding of the squad. That left him playing catch-up when it came to new signings.It meant despite talk of better to come, with the exception of a brief spell around February, hopes of a top-six challenge gave way to another battle for survival.It was achieved via three wins from the first four post-split fixtures but, even so, it was clear better was expected this season.Another summer of signings this year gave some hope that would be the case but, although progression from the Betfred Cup group stage was secured, a home defeat at the hands of Championship Dunfermline and a lack of goals were worrying.Performances in opening league games against St Mirren and Aberdeen were decent but both ended in defeat.Then an inept and ill-disciplined display against Ayr in the last  of the Betfred Cup that saw three goals conceded and two red cards had the alarm bells ringing.After that the defeats continued coming. There was brief respite via a solitary success at Hamilton last month but he departs having lost eight of his last nine fixtures.If that was not bad enough, his time in charge saw stories of discord in the dressing-room and bust-ups with ious players during his time in charge didn’t help.Most notably was the argument that led to star goalie Scott Bain’s time at Dens coming to an abrupt end. Now McCann and assistant Graham Gartland have paid the price."},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"Swindonrsquos own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the thAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"five-takeaways-in-and-around-glasgow-set-to-compete-for-best-in-scotland","story":"FIVE takeaways in and around Glasgow are set to head to London to battle-it-out for the best in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"riverford-gardens-first-release-of-homes-in-glasgow-private-housing-development-launches","story":"THE first release of properties in one of the cityrsquos largest private housing developments has been launched."},{"url":null,"title":"universal-credit-help-to-get-online-to-make-a-claim","story":"WITH smart phones, tablets and personal computers becoming a dominant feature in everyday le, you could be forgiven for thinking everyone is using the latest technology."},{"url":null,"title":"free-tickets-for-sporting-event-up-for-grabs","story":"A CHARITY is giving away free tickets to the Scottish Open Badminton Championships at Glasgowrsquos Emirates Arena."},{"url":null,"title":"lucky-fans-could-meet-st-mirren-legend-tony-fitzpatrick","story":"ST MIRREN legend Tony Fitzpatrick is offering a unique triple bonus to people who pre-order his soon-to-be published autobiography."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-cinema-to-celebrate-movie-release-with-queen-inspired-evening","story":"QUEEN fans will be treated to a live performance at a Glasgow cinema to celebrate the launch of the new biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody."},{"url":null,"title":"this-is-why-sirens-could-be-heard-in-glasgow-city-centre-tonight","story":"PEOPLE in the city centre might have heard the blare of sirens tonight - but not for the usual reason."},{"url":null,"title":"peaky-blinders-star-hails-celtics-kiernan-tierney","story":"A PEAKY Blinders star has praised Celtics Kieran Tierney in a viral video."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-peoples-palace-and-winter-gardens-to-close-indefinitely","story":"GLASGOWrsquoS tourism industry is expected to take a major hit as two popular attractions are set to close indefinitely."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-caledonian-university-praised-for-tourism-work-as-moffat-scholarships-announced","story":"THE man tasked with driving forward one of the worldrsquos most famous coastal touring routes paid tribute to Glasgow Caledonian Universityfor helping to make it a success."},{"url":null,"title":"gary-lewis-to-honour-conscientious-objector-ahead-of-armistice-anniversary","story":"A GLASGOW university will be sharing a letter from its achieve highlighting the struggle of Scotlandrsquos Conscientious Objectors who refused the call to arms in the First World War."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-raffling-off-3m-mansion-for-just-25-a-ticket","story":"AN English couple have decided to raffle off their pound million house via an online contest."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117936.jpg","title":"Book festival organisers blown away by participant numbers","story":"THOUSANDS of children took part in a mass reading event to set a new record for an Inverness book festival.A total of  primary pupils across the region read ndash or were read to ndash at the same time to launch NessBookFest which featured a broad programme of almost  free events over four days.Festival committee member and organiser Barbara Henderson was delighted with the numbers taking part in the read-in.\"We were blown away by the response,\" she said. \"Our previous record was only in the high hundreds.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::.

There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

Cara Taven, from Coylton, set up a Facebook page called ‘Girls Against Spiking’to bring to light the effects of spiking on nights out and to, hopefully, eradicate it. The Facebook page, which has gained a following of over  people in one week, hopes to attract the attention of nightclubs and bars and is aiming for lids to be put on all drinks served at their bars as part of a drive to stop people having their drinks spiked.  Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners. And there will be legendary amounts of Kummel quaffed in the clubhousethey win this one!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentPrestwickAirAsiaAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"chief inspector makes return south","story":"NewsChief inspector makes ato South AyrshireChief Inspector Derek Frew takes over the reigns from Gary I’Anson.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsChief Inspector Derek Frew \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new chief inspector in South Ayrshire has vowed to put the community at the heart of policing.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"new eaterie chip 25 new","story":"NewsNew eaterie will chip in with  new jobs in PerthInvestment for the cityShareByDouglas Dickie:,  OCT NewsAlessandra Vareseat the Blue Lagoon in Ayr - this will soon be a familiar sight in Perth\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe opening of an iconic fish and chip restaurant in Perth city centre could create around  jobs for the city, the PA can reveal.

Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13420214.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_asr_ayp_031018gin1.jpg","title":"world wonder through looking glass","story":"NewsWorld of wonder through the looking glass at Hendricks GinIt’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsWhere the magic happens Hendricks Gin Palace \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“A gin made oddly”– put simply by the gin gods themselves – Hendrick’s. It’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan. And it’s at the newly developed multi-million pound Hendrick’s Gin Palace where the magic and wonder begins. The most signicant development since launch in , Hendrick’s Gin has been impressively expanded to meet the global demand for the ever popular drink. William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

the months leading up to this, their first full production.ldquoWe thought a programme cover competition would help get other children involved and of course, help spread the word about this fabulous show and make it a huge success to reward all the childrenrsquos efforts.Both primary and secondary aged children across Tweeddale and Peeblesshire are being invited to design a cover with whatever they feel best represents the show.The showrsquos title does not need to be included as this will already be produced on the cover, however artwork must be within an area of cm x cm.While the winning

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere.

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

As well as offering a home for nature, bogs play a key role in water quality and flow and in a healthy state, peat is an essential weapon in the fight against climate change, acting as a massive sink for greenhouse gases.But when damaged they can release huge quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.Now a further , hectares of damaged peatlands are starting on the road to recovery after the pound million in extra funding from the Scottish Government for the national Peatland Action scheme.It will be spent on conservation measures including landscaping to reduce exposed peat and the installation of peat dams to restore water levels in blanket bogs, which are vital to carbon capture and provide habitats for many important Scottish species.Work will involve blocking gullies to prevent the earth from drying out and releasing carbon into the atmosphere.Eroded areas of bare peat will also be re-planted to stabilise the surface.These measures will improve mountain vegetation, which will in turn benefit native wildle and birds such as the snipe, skylark and greenshank.Andrew McBride, Project Manager of the Peatland ACTION project said: ldquoPeat covers over % of Scotlandrsquos land area and it is estimated that over % of this is in a degraded condition.\"The SNH Peatland ACTION team works with land managers across Scotland and in partnership with other organisations to restore degraded peatlands ndash to date we have started the process of restoration on nearly ,ha of peatlands.\"Most of our work involves advising on ditch blocking, stabilising eroded areas, and re-establishing vegetation ndash most notably by the bog building plant sphagnum moss.ldquoNot only are peatlands part of our landscape and cultural heritage, providing a unique habitat for species such as large heath butterflies and sundew plants, they are important for our environment. Peat stores carbon, reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.\"Peatbogs retain and filter water, reducing the impact of drought or flooding and keeping our burns clean for fishing and drinking.Across the world, large-scale degradation is causing serious environmental and social impact, with annual emissions estimated at around two gigatonnes of carbon dioxide -  per cent of all global emissions.Rewetting damaged peatlands can bring them back to good condition.Scots are being urged to avoid using peat-based compost in their gardens to help preserve resources.Conservationists say the current reliance on the ancient material for growing certain plants is \"totally unacceptable and unsustainable\", and people should turn to alternatives that are just as effective and readily available.Nearly a quarter of Scotlands entire land area - around two million hectares - is made up of peat bogs, which are estimated to contain around , million tonnes of carbon.The habitat also plays a crucial role in helping guard against flooding, purying water and supporting rare native wildle such as adders, golden plovers, dragonflies and carnivorous sundew plants.Extraction of peat destroys peatlands, which take thousands of years to form - laying down just mm per year.

These include the design of stealth drones advocated by defence companies such as BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin.The discovery, which confirms the common plant among the natural worldrsquos best fliers, shows movement of air around and within its ldquoparachute-shaped bundle of bristles often enables seeds to travel half a mile or more, kept afloat entirely by windpower.Gardeners generally dislike dandelions as they are viewed as weeds which have huge taproots that break easily when being removed.It can also regenerate from the tiniest piece to four times the size of what gardeners were trying to remove in the first place.The featherweight seeds carry on the lightest breeze and lodge themselves into every crack in the ground and every millimetre of bare soil.:Drone ban for children proposedDandelion pollen is not particularly nutritious, compared with that of clover and vetches, but it is available when little  is about.From March to November it offers a reliable source of food for all species of bees, beetles, butterflies and hoverflies.Now researchers from Edinburgh University have carried out experiments to understand why dandelion seeds fly so well, despite their parachute structure being largely made up of empty space.The findings show the seeds could be used in helping design under-the-radar technology such as drones for spy missions by the security services.The study revealed that a ring-shaped air bubble forms as air moves through the bristles.This enhances the drag that slows each seedrsquos descent to the ground.The newly found form of air bubble, which scientists have named the separated vortex ring, is physically detached from the bristles and stabilised by air flowing through it.Researchers found that the amount of air is critical for keeping the bubble stable and directly above the seed in flight, and is precisely controlled by the spacing of the bristles.The flight mechanism of the bristly parachute underpins the seedsrsquo steady flight and is four times more efficient than a conventional parachute.Scientists say the dandelionrsquos porous parachute may inspire the development of small-scale drones that require little or no power.Such drones could also be useful for remote sensing or air pollution monitoring.:New dandelion find on St Kilda#They hope their findings can be used to help engineering and sustainable technology fields.Dr Cathal Cummins, of the universityrsquos Schools of Biological Sciences and Engineering, who led the study, said: ldquoTaking a closer look at the ingenious structures in nature, like the dandelionrsquos parachute, can reveal novel insights.BAE Systems recently unveiled an aircraft design that is viewed as a major advance in stealth technology.The Magma drone does away with aircraft control surfaces, which has resulted in an aircraft whose shape remains constant throughout its flight.The small demonstration aircraft, which has completed a successful first flight, uses blown air to change direction instead of complex mechanical controls.Most aeroplanes look unmoving in flight, like a wing hanging off a giant tube flying through the sky.But conventional aircraft use a system of elevators, rudders and ailerons to control their direction in the pitch and roll directions.:Drone photography poses risk to wildle - expertsThese mechanical devices are usually in the shape of control surfaces attached to the rear of the wing, horizontal and vertical stabilisers and are controlled by the pilot ndash or sometimes an onboard flight computer.Control surfaces have been an instrumental part of aircraft since the early th century. These mechanisms can and do fail, limiting an aeroplanersquos manoeuvrability.But among a new generation of stealth warplanes, control surfaces can also affect an airplanersquos carefully shaped stealth profile, as the fin-like device moves upward or downward, momentarily making the aircraft slightly more visible to radar.Now the Edinburgh University researchers are hopeful that the dandelion seeds can help advance the technology further.The study, published in science journal Nature, was funded by the Leverhulme Trust and the Royal Society."},{"url":null,"title":"dublin-offers-to-extend-the-transition-period-may-has-not-ruled-it-out","story":"The countrys deputy prime minister Simon Coveney reacted positively to reports that EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier was open to pushing the implementation period back a year to end in December .UK Government sources insisted Downing Street was not calling for an extension to transition arrangements which is not an outright rejection.The offer will enrage Brexiteers who will argue it would keep the UK effectively in the single market and customs union for at least another year with British taxpayers continue to pay over billions of pounds to EU coffers.Plus, it would enrage UK fishermen as it would mean the country would not take back control of its waters until December  at the earliest more than five years after the  EU vote.Theresa May is preparing for what is likely to be a fractious Prime Ministers Questions in the Commons before she travels to Brussels for talks with Donald Tusk, the European Council President, and before she addressed EU leaders ahead of an EU dinner.There are growing concerns the two sides will be unable to bridge the gap over the key issue of agreeing a \"backstop\" deal to ensure there will not be ato a hard border in Ireland when the UK quits the EU.Mr Coveney told BBC Radio s Today programme: \"What Michel Barnier is now suggesting is, look, lets ensure that the backstop is never likely to be used by creating the space and time for the UK and the EU to be able to negotiate UK-wide customs arrangements that can ensure that there wont ever be the need for customs checks between Britain and Northern Ireland.\"We have always said that we are happy to show flexibility in terms of how we get to a destination where-by there is a backstop, or an insurance mechanism, in place to reassure people on the island of Ireland that they are not going to see the re-emergence of physical border infrastructure.\"And what Michel Barnier has indicated very clearly is that the EU side, certainly, is willing to allow more time in the transition period to agree an alternative solution to a backstop.\"The EU meeting is the occasion when the leaders of the remaining  member states were supposed to give the green light for a special summit in November to finalise the terms of Britains withdrawal.But Mr Coveney made it clear that summit would not go ahead unless signicant progress is made on the border issue.He said: \"Whats more likely is that dates will be suggested, but that there wont be a commitment to a new summit unless there is a signal from the negotiating teams that there is something to sign off on.\"Both sides want to get a deal done here, and I think we need... to allow the negotiating teams to set the pace with a view to making recommendations, hopefully by mid-November, that a new summit is necessary to sign off on a final deal.\"Mr Tusk has warned that without new \"concrete proposals\" from the British to break the logjam over the Irish border backstop, further progress on a deal may be impossible.However, with her party split, and some Tory MPs openly calling for her to go, Mrs May has little room to manoeuvreshe is to secure a deal which stands any chance of getting through Parliament.Ahead of her visit to Brussels, Mrs May was able to secure the backing of her Cabinet, at least for now, amid reports that some Brexiteer ministers were prepared to quitshe gave too much ground to Brussels.However, there was anger among Tory Brexiteers after The Dailyreported that Chancellor Philip Hammond warned the meeting that the UK could still have to pay the EU up to pound billion of the pound billion \"orce bill\" to settle its outstanding liabilities, in the event of a no-deal break.The PM is also due to have bilateral meetings with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker,and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar."},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-goring-a-smacking-ban-would-truly-make-us-a-civilised-nation","story":"So why would it be any dferent for a child  When parents chastise their children with a smack or a slap, it is far worse than hitting an adult. Grown-ups can defend themselves, or walk away. A partnership or marriage can end, but childhood lasts forever. Unless parental force is so extreme that the authorities have to step in, young children cannot escape their punishers. They simply have to grow wary, and hope it doesnrsquot happen again.Proposals to outlaw smacking, to be brought before Holyrood in a memberrsquos bill by Green MSP John Finnie, might become law within the year. It will be a historic day, a signal that we are among the most civilised of nations, committed to caring for those who canrsquot protect themselves.When you look at the levels of anger and violence in our own society, let alone the world, this change of culture canrsquot come soon enough. Yet the prospect of the ban has caused protests. Less than a thirdof respondents to a survey support it, and more than halfbelieve smacking should still be allowed.Their main worry, it seems, is not the welfare of children but the potential for so-called respectable adults to be criminalised for raising their offspring as they see fit. For some, as for their own parents and countless generations before them, teaching right from wrong involves tough love. How  can a toddler be prevented from running into the road  Surely a short, sharp lesson will make the point and potentially save their lives Well, perhaps. But to judge by the number of times Irsquove watched little ones yanked by the arm, thumped on the bottom or the back of the legs and even on one occasion slapped hard on the face ndash all without modying their behaviour ndash it would seem the message isnrsquot getting through. Pain and humiliation do not result in obedience and docility. When used too often, or fiercely, smacking causes resentment, rebellion and fear. A woman thwacking her spaniel to bring it to heel would be universally viewed with horror. Some might even dare to remonstrate. But when itrsquos a child, we are schooled to walk on, since itrsquos none of our business.In previous ages, when people were less educated, families large and money tight, physical punishment was deemed perfectly acceptable. Now, however, it looks uncomfortably like brutality. Since time immemorial the British attitude to children has been punitive, telling them to keep quiet, and allowing them to become the butt of unfeeling or sadistic schoolteachers as well as parents. Yet a teacher today who clipped a pupil over the ear or brought a ruler down on the back of their hands would be queuing up at the JobCentre before nightfall. Such acts were outlawed decades ago. By introducing a smacking ban, government will thus be calling time on the harsh treatment inflicted on children at home, where privacy no longer hides them from the reach of the law.Most parents will admit that smacking is not a sign that they are in charge, but that they have lost control. The signal it sends to youngsters is that aggression is a normal response to a situation. To the old argument that ldquoit never did me any harm, take a look at the levels of depression, addiction and anxiety around us. Coming under physical attack from the people who love you most is deeply and sometimes permanently scarring. It can lead to self-harming, to abusive relationships in adulthood and, since they have experienced it from infancy, to lashing out when under duress.Itrsquos half a century since Bob Dylan wrote his prophetic song in which he tells mothers and fathers: ldquoYour sons and your daughters Are beyond your command Your old road is Rapidly aginrsquo. Please get out of the new one If you canrsquot lend your hand  For the times they are a-changinrsquo.They are indeed changing, and for the better. Rethinking how to educate and control children requires time, effort, and bottomless reserves of patience and self-restraint. It involves talking to youngsters, and reasoning with them, once they are old enough to understand, and drawing lines beyond which there will be consequences ndash but none of them violent.I know several young mums with demanding families, one with four boys below eight.

Not by the cheeky Pink promo idea, but by the fact someone had imagined me wearing a Scotland shirt. And that set the mind into a quandary. I still have pics of me as a seven year-old wearing a Scotland shirt, imagining myself to be a young Baxteror a dark-haired Jinky. I wore this soft cotton classic to bed. I wore it until it demanded it be boil washed in Lux. I wore this shirt until my skinny little frame produced enough content to stretch its seams to breaking point.My Scotland shirt connection didnrsquot end there. In my late teens and early twenties I wore one to Wembley. To Hampden. On holiday. But right now I feel Irsquod rather wear lederhosen and a sparkly boob tube. The idea of pulling on a Scotland jersey simply seems wrong.Why this disconnect  It doesnrsquot apply to all cultural forms. I still think Lulu to be the greatest white soul singer everand love Gerry Rafferty, and Scots comedy and Still Game. Could it be that the football of latehasnrsquot been great  Perhaps. But being destroyed by Israel wasnrsquot a surprise what would have been a surprise was the score line being reversed.Has this rejection of the jersey something to to with the growth of Nationalism  A friend whorsquos not a Nationalist is now talking of voting for independence when Ref  is called, on the basis of feeling aggrieved that Scotland is being Brexited. As it happens, Irsquom with this sentiment. But where we part company is this sense of injustice is not the loudest voice in my head. The voice screaming out is one of worry for the future, for the children who have to grow up in this little indie world which exists without a thought-out economic plan.Could my not pulling on the jersey be down to the fact the SNP wonrsquot reveal a strategy for containing multinational tax dodging, supporting the ailing NHS or determining who will build schools  If I slip on the Scotland jersey am I shedding the warm vest that has been the Barnett Formula Whatrsquos inarguable is we are now a ided, self-centred little nation. In movie imagery terms on the one side are the Brigadooners, , and The Debt Collectors, who believe there is ultimately a price to pay for living on little more than a dream.Meantime, we live in a Scotland in which we are constantly being dabbed with the calamine lotion of liberal policy. Last week, Scotland ldquodeclared war on hate crimes, a statement so nebulous yoursquod need an astro telescope to work out any form of fine line detail. So much of our governmentrsquos policy is displacement activity. And much of it, as my colleague Iain MacWhirter pointed out this week, not well thought out, such as the anti-sectarian bill.The fear of the shirt may also be the fear of the economic cliques the country has encouraged and will continue to grow.Itrsquos a worry, for example, over Creative Scotland, reflected in the hapless judgements of last year, or Scottish Enterprise and a claimed poundm lost in failed businesses in the past decade.But perhaps the fear of the new Adidas jumper reflects a changing national identity.Wersquove kept our dark, cheeky aggression, but lost our sense of community, our support systems, our ldquotake your turn of the stairs mentality.There are deeper thoughts emerging about being part of Team Scotland. Therersquos the worry London mayor Sadiq Khan may be right when he connects nationalism with racism. Therersquos a concern that when hermetic Nationalists valorise Scotland and demand separation from England it implies that England is somehow less. If we care about social justice and egalitarianism why does it need to stop at Carlisle This somehow sits at odds with the times of those early Scotland strips being worn when the essence of being Scottish was summed up by someone such as Jimmy Reid. Perhaps the Scotland jersey was headed for the recycle bank bin when Tommy Sheridan ended up on Big Brother and Alex Salmond on Russia Today.Perhaps the Brigadoon mist cleared with new understandings of what Scotland is about. Itrsquos a knowing of the part we played in the slave trade, that Robert Louis Stevenson created the world view of shortbread tin Scotland, and that in fact he wrote of darker duality of his home nation in the likes of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Kidnapped, that Scotland has long been at war with itself, reflected in aspiration and sometimes sheer greed.Perhaps thatrsquos why I canrsquot see me pulling on that Scotland jersey anytime soon.

The new strategy will shape the country’s transport priorities for the next  years.Age Scotland and Transport Scotland have said they have been working closely with older people in communities across island, rural and urban Scotland since spring to understand how transport affects older peoples’ daily lives.Gillian Skuse, Charity Director of Age Scotland Orkney, stressed how important it is that local older people get involved in these discussions.“We’ve heard from older people around the islands that transport can impact their mobility, running their errands, enjoying activities and being part of their local communities. This consultation is a great opportunity for older Orcadians’ comments and experiences to help shape future planning for more inclusive, affordable and accessible transport on our islands.”Speaking about the workshop, Age Scotland’s Policy Engagement  Campaigns Officer Simon Ritchie said: “We know that a lack of transport options can be a huge barrier for many older people in the Highlands and Islands living the le they want to live. Around , older people in Scotland don’t see anyone  for at least half a week so easy access to good transport options is vital to older people allowing them to run errands, meet friends and family, make medical appointments and improve their quality of le.#This is a brilliant opportunity for older people in Orkney to share their views on transport and shape the new National Transport Strategy.  Age Scotland and Transport Scotland want to hear how transport works for older Orcadians so that decision-makers can ensure older Orcadians can access the services they need in order to enjoy later le.#“We invite any and all older people in Orkney to come along and share their views with us.”The transport workshop will take place in Finstown on Thursday October  at the Orkney Men#s Shed. Tea and coffee will be available on arrival from . am with the day starting at . am.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much.

And they, he added, are “simply unwilling to have more turbines foisted upon them”.So they will doubtless be dismayed by the news that Scottish Power has sold off its gas and hydro plants to concentrate on wind and renewables, with plans to more than double the capacity of windfarms currently generating electricity or under construction. However, for others, it is a sign of things to come, a move that heralds a new age as the world moves towards a zero-carbon future that will enable us to avoid dangerous climate change and bring a literal breath of fresh air to blow away potentially deadly pollution.These two groups may seem implacably opposed to one another, but in reality they both make valid points. Scotland is famous all over the world for the romantic beauty of its landscape, a fact that helps encourage millions of tourists to come here. Allowing the industrialisation of the Highlands would be a scandal. But, fortunately, that does not need to happen. Scotland has vast amounts of wind energy and it is possible to site onshore windfarms in places where they do not desecrate the countryside. : Scottish Power becomes first big UK energy firm to switch to % wind powerAnd the most consistent supply of wind is found out to sea, particularly on the west coast, as anyone who has visited the Outer Hebrides can attest. The UK Government has been criticised for failing to encourage onshore windfarms – not least because they are a source of increasingly cheap electricity. However, part of Westminster’s strategy has been to encourage offshore wind in the hope that the UK – and particularly Scotland – can create a globally signicant industry. As UK Energy Minister Claire Perry pointed out in The Scotsman yesterday, the transition to renewable energy is a challenge but also “one of the greatest industrial opportunities of our time”. So Scotland can help the world fight climate change and make money in the process.And it is the latter reason that is perhaps the most important driving force, as Scottish Power’s chief executive Keith Anderson suggested when he said: “We are leaving carbon generation behind for a renewable future powered by cheaper green energy.” The firm has become the first of the ‘Big Six’ to ditch fossil fuels but simple economics means it is unlikely to be the last,: UK Energy Minister: Scotland has a chance of a letime on green energy©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4816633.1539867950!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may ready to delay brexit by matter of months","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresa May has confirmed she is ready to consider a delay of #a matter of months# in Britain#s final departure from the EU in order to avoid a hard border in Ireland.But the Prime Minister said she does not expect any extension of the so-called “transition” to Brexit to be needed, because she still hopes to conclude a deal on the UK’s future trade and security relationship with the EU by its scheduled end-date of December .: Row erupts over Commons ‘meaningful vote’ on Brexit Withdrawal BillMrs May faced a backlash from Brexiteers after she indicated at a Brussels summit on Wednesday that she was not ruling out the UK remaining in the single market and customs union and subject to EU rules as late as the end of .Such a move would delay the final departure almost three years after the official date of Brexit on March  , and more than five years after the  referendum vote to Leave, potentially costing the UK as much as £ billion in additional contributions to the EU budgets.Arriving for the second day of the European Council summit, Mrs May made clear she would accept an extension only as a means to ensure there was no hard border in Irelandit proved impossible to implement the future partnership by the end of .“A further idea that has emerged - and it is an idea at this stage - is to create an option to extend the implementation period for a matter of months, and it would only be for a matter of months,” she said.“But the point is that this is not expected to be used, because we are working to ensure that we have that future relationship in place by the end of December .“I’m clear that it is possible to do that and that is what we are working for. In those circumstances, there would be no need for any proposal of this sort and I’m clear that I expect the implementation period to end at the end of December .”Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage said any extension to the transition period could delay full withdrawal almost until the general election scheduled for May , and “may mean we never leave at all”.Tory MP Nadine Dorries repeated her call for former Brexit secretary David Davis to replace Mrs May as leader.“We cannot find the money to fund our front-line police properly, we cannot find the £ billion for the vulnerable on Universal Credit, but we can mysteriously find billions to bung to the EU for the unnecessary extra year Clegg and Blair asked Barnier for to waylay Brexit,” said Ms Dorries.Conservative former minister Nick Boles - who is pushing for a “soft Brexit” move to temporary membership of the European Free Trade Association- warned Mrs May is losing the confidence of the Tory party.He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme the EU is demanding “humiliating concessions” because the PM’s Brexit plans fail to fix the problem of the Irish border.“I’m afraid she is losing the confidence now of colleagues of all shades of opinion,” he said.“They are close to despair at the state of this negotiation because there is a fear that both the Government and the European Union are trying to run out the clock, that they are trying to leave this so late that they can credibly say there is no alternative but a no-deal Brexit, and most people agree that would be chaos.“That is not an acceptable way for a leader of a government to behave.”Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: “Extending the transition  More like kicking the can further down the road and delaying, by a bit, driving off the clf.“No deal the PM can secure will be as good as staying in the EU.”Meanwhile, leading Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg joined Mr Davis and three other former ministers in signing an open letter warning the Prime Minister not to “bind the UK into the purgatory of perpetual membership of the EU’s customs union”.The group called on Mrs May to “reset” the negotiations and ditch her Chequers Brexit blueprint in favour of a Canada-style free trade agreement.“We are close to the moment of truth. Brexit offers the prize of a better future, global free trade deals and political independence,” said the letter.“Butthese potential gains are sacriced because of EU bullying and the Government’s desperation to secure a deal, the British people will not forgive us.”Mrs May initially suggested an “implementation period” of around two years after Brexit, to give the UK’s authorities and companies time to prepare for new arrangements, but later accepted a -month transition ending on the last day of .It emerged on Wednesday that EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is ready to discuss a further year’s extension to allow time to find a solution to keep the Irish border open.UK officials stressed the Prime Minister is not proposing any extension to the period already agreed.Leaders of the  remaining EU states ditched proposals for a special Brexit summit in November, after Mr Barnier told them he needed “much more time” to find a way to avoid a hard border.This week’s summit had been billed as “the moment of truth” when agreement is needed to allow time for ratication in the Westminster and European parliaments.But Mrs May has not come forward with the new “concrete proposals” demanded by European Council president Donald Tusk, instead telling fellow leaders that “courage, trust and leadership” are needed on both sides to find a solution.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4816723.1539861701!/image/image.jpg","title":"tory politician unable to understand snp mp due to glaswegian accent","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A breakdown in communication left a Scottish MP unable to get answers in Parliament.The SNP’s David Linden, MP for Glasgow East, asked about improvements to disability access during House of Commons Commission questions.window.twttr Representing the commission, former minister Sir Paul Beresford twice asked Mr Linden to repeat himself because he could not understand what he had said.Conservative Sir Paul, who holds dual New Zealand and British citizenship, said: “I’m sorry, it must be something to do with my antipodean background.“Could you please repeat the question because I didn’t follow it ”There was laughter and a comment of “oh wow” from the SNP benches as Mr Linden despondently said “oh well, I’m very popular today” and repeated the question at a slower pace.Sir Paul still struggled and asked again for Mr Linden to repeat it “more slowly and in antipodean English”.Deputy Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who has a robust Lancashire accent, intervened at the impasse, saying: “I think the answer might be helpedhe can reply in writing.”Mr Linden then resorted to sign language across the Chamber to confirm he would write to his colleague.He is not the first SNP MP to have dficulties making himself understood.Last year, SNP MP Alan Brown revealed ministers have so much trouble understanding his thick Ayrshire accent that he rarely receives direct answers to his questions when he speaks in the Commons chamber.Reporters at Hansard, the official verbatim report of Parliament, struggle with the same problem and pass notes to the SNP backbencher asking him to write out what he said whenever he rises to speak.Mr Browntold the Press Association the issue has become “a running joke” with colleagues and that, whenever he gets up to speak, he notices the minster sink back into their green leather bench and put their ear right up against the speaker embedded in it.The parliamentary sketch writers are also known to scratch their heads when he is speaking.Mr Brown said: “Sometimes Hansard ask what other people say but I make the joke that they must have an Ayrshire translator in now but the Ayrshire translator doesn’t understand my colleagues.” ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism.

I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues.

I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical.Ian,I assume you mean “s of tonnes of concrete” per turbine base  Given that a single, typical .MW turbine needs over a thousand tonnes of steel-reinforced concrete , then VE turbines, whose blades will sweep  times the area , at . times the height, must surely need bases several times bigger than that # perhaps, - tonnes, each The accompanying destruction of the land these machines are sited on is also alarming # here is a quote from the link, again, for the small, .MW machine: Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof. Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed. Just look how fearlessly he locked horns with the powerful vested interests south who were forever conspiring to keep Shetland in its box.

Islands proofing – ensuring the islands are recognised in any law or government regulation – must work.#There are too many cases right now where that is not happening, such as the government imposing car parking charges on leline airports where there is no public transport alternative.#For the Islands Act to be worth the parchment it’s written on, these things must change.#Islands Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: #The Scottish Islands have contributed and continue to contribute hugely to our culture and heritage and, with this Act now starting to take force, will now have the opportunity to contribute even further to their own and our collective futures.#They have very distinctive needs so the Act introduces a number of measures to ensure there is a sustained focus across government and the wider public sector to meet the needs of island communities now and in the future.“On a more visual front, it ensures Shetland will no longer be ‘boxed off’ on maps which has been a cause of irritation to those living in Shetland.#When producing a map of Scotland, the Shetland Islands must therefore be displayed in a way that accurately and proportionately represents their geographical location in relation to the rest of Scotland.“It introduces a new duty on Scottish ministers and the wider public sector to have regard to island communities when exercising their s and preparing policy, strategies, services and legislation – known as “island-proofing”.“And the National Islands Plan will also be produced which, amongst other things, gives us a strategic direction to improve outcomes for our islands by creating the right environment for investment, empowerment and increasing sustainable economic growth.” raquoI#m glad to hear that Shetlandcan#t be put into a box on maps.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"11 greenwell gott ","story":"Offers over £,This exclusive development comprises thirteen houses grouped around a large communal park which provides a great play area for children being on a no-through road.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral.

It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8671926.1539771380!/image/image.jpg","title":"chinese delegation on trade visit to borough","story":"A Chinese delegation visited Mid and East Antrim this week for a key meeting focused on strengthening business links and increasing trade between both areas.Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor Lindsay Millar, hosted visitors including Mr Xinsheng Zhao, Jacques, Director of the China Jiangsu Provincial Economic and Trade Office in the UK Mr Gao Meeng, Mayor, Chief of the people’s government of Donghai County and Mr Li Feng, Secretary of the Party Working Committee of Donghai Economic Development Zone.Jiangsu is one of the leading provinces in China in terms of finance, education, technology and tourism while Donghai County is among the top  economic counties in China and one of the most attractive potential investment areas in China.Mayor Lindsay Millar said: “I was delighted to welcome the delegation to Mid and East Antrim and the meeting proved extremely beneficial for both parties, ending with the signing of a friendship agreement between both areas.“Our key strategic priority is growing the economy – with China identied as a vital partner to those investment plans, and closer ties offering huge potential for mutually beneficial business links through jobs and prosperity both here and in China.”Councillor Audrey Wales MBE said: “We in Mid and East Antrim are committed to doing all that we can to build relationships with China and harness a relationship aimed at boosting practical and mutual benefits.“We are capitalising on all opportunities to develop relationships with global businesses leaders and raise our profile as an attractive investment location.”She added: “Crucial to those plans is Amply, our economic strategy for Mid and East Antrim, which we launched earlier this year and is aimed at promoting the development of our borough right through until .“Greater collaboration with our Chinese partners is crucial to delivering on our vision.”Chief Executive Anne Donaghy said: “We are blessed with an abundance of talent in Mid and East Antrim, and it is vital we work together to harness those skills and potential to successfully grow the local economy.“We are keen to build and develop a relationship with China to foster partnership with regions and organisation in order to identy opportunities to increase trade and economic activity promote Foreign Direct Investment increase tourism encourage strategic investment in infrastructure promote and generate investment in Mid and East Antrim and establish cultural links.“We have a number of local companies with existing links to China.

Angela and John with some of the trophies Angela Jeffers, , a technology and design technician at Hazelwood Integrated College, and her husband John, , operations trainer at Belfast International Airport, started as casual dancers but in the past few years have stepped up to competition level.This summer they were the sole representatives from NI to take part in the Dance Promoters Association’s showpiece in Bournemouth where they were crowned Closed UK Champions in the Over  Beginners category. They also picked up third place in the Over s Novice bracket.Angela, who is originally from Ashton-under-Lyne near Manchester, said: “We’re both kept very busy with our jobs but we’ve our weekends free to devote to dancing. We fly over to Liverpool on a Friday night for a lesson for two hours, have a competition on the Sunday and then fly home on Monday morning and go straight back into work.”Along with her husband John who comes from Crumlin, they have picked up an impressive haul of trophies with the prizes they received at the Bournemouth Summer Festival taking pride of place.   Angela and John Jeffers in action “We were up against so many good dancers,” said Angela. “We were astounded to finish with a first and a third place.”She added: “We started dancing lessons just after we got married, so that’s about  years ago, but the competitions we’ve been doing for less than three years.“It never even occurred to us to take lessons before we got married for the first dance. We got married in a very small castle hotel near Edinburgh. We didn’t have a disco anyway, we had a magician instead.”Askedthe dance competitions the pair took part in looked in any way like Strictly Come Dancing, Angela said: “I always worry that all people see of dancing is Strictly. That’s more like show dancing.    Angela and John Jeffers “Competition dancing is not like Strictly whatsover. Our routines are based on trying to get the footwork correct, the timing, the posture.“People think they’re going to see us throwing each other around over our heads. What we do is proper dancing.“For example, to go through the steps of the foxtrot is not dficult, it’s making it look like a foxtrot that is the skill. If someone is dancing and you’re watching them through a window, would you know what dance they are doing  Most times it just looks like they’re walking around the room.”Police investigating link between Ballymena break-ins Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"She added: “In Strictly when you see the smoke on the floor, they’re hiding their feet. The amount of time they spend out of hold, floating about wasting time, that wouldn’t happen in a proper competition.   John and Angela dressed for their appearance in Lost City of Z “I think people who watch Strictly will end up having an unrealistic expectation about dancing. They think you can learn to dance in a week. If we all had a professional training us for  hours a day maybe we could.“It takes a lot longer when you’re only doing one lesson a week which is closer to the norm because of time and money. We go three times a week, maybe spend about five or six hours practising, but that’s because we’re in competitions.”Detailing how they began dancing, Angela said: “It was something that I always wanted to do. We saw this advertisement in a shop in Randalstown for Bob Lindsay’s social dancing class.“My husband started as a reluctant dancer, he really only did it for me. Although he does enjoy it a lot more now.”The pair moved on to Clarke’s Dance Studios in Belfast before getting tuition from Paul Taylor, a professional dancer from Liverpool.Angela said: “I remember being a bag of nerves before our first competition in England. But as we stepped up our lessons our technique, footwork and timing improved. As we did more competitions we started getting a few firsts.“Sadly there aren’t really any competitions in Northern Ireland so mostly we go to England or down to Ireland.“You don’t really do it for the prizes, it’s for personal achievement. We’re all in it together. You get quite friendly with the people you’re dancing against. It can be emotionally draining.”More than being just a hobby that fills their weekends, the couple’s dancing has proved important for John’s health.Angela said: “John had le saving heart surgery seven years ago. He had an aortic aneurism and calcied aortic valve.“He had both replaced in a seven hour operation, at the Royal and was back dancing – gently – after four weeks. “He used the dancing to help rebuild his strength and fitness.” On October , Angela and John will be reunited with their first dance teacher Bob Lindsay for a demonstration in Ballyclare Town Hall.Through their dancing the couple ended up in the feature film ‘Lost City of Z’ in a ballroom scene.John has also appeared on television in an episode of Countryfile looking at the hare population at Belfast International Airport where he works.try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1093314.jpg--.jpg?1539853794000\n","title":"is kilrea road sliding away","story":"Concerns have been raised about a section of the Kilrea Road where subsidence has caused the footpath to crack.

However, there is also some natural subsidence that also needs to be addressed.Councillor Gaston wishes to give some reassurance to the public about the current safety of the footpath and boundary wall.He said: “The Department have said the wall is in no immediate danger of collapsing, but obviously there is a danger of this in the future, so I am eagerly and actively pushing that a solution be reached, before the problem gets any worse.” Many residents have expressed a fear thatthe situation persists, the road may have to be closed indefinitely, which is something Councillor Gaston is also keen to avoid. “There is a fear that part of the road might actually come away, so I am urging officials to act quickly to get a plan in place and be proactive about a solution so as work can be carried out in a controlled way, and the road will only have to be closed for necessary work, not indefinitely.”No plan for the road has been made to date, however officials are currently assessing the wall, footpath and road, and work on devising a plan is underway.

Frank’s story is one of a number which has been put together for the release of a tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends of Thomas and Gerard which is to be launched this weekend in Sailortown.Frank, who is now -years-old worked for Casey’s for over twenty years, recalls that day when fate determined who was in the yard that morning when the gunmen arrived.“My main job in Casey’s was to drive the old Bedford TK lorry, making deliveries to pubs, clubs and off licences. I always had one of the young lads on board as a helper,” explained Frank.“Every Wednesday for thirteen years I delivered to Casey’s off licences in Derry and Coleraine. They would ring in their orders on Monday. We would load up the old reliable Bedford on Tuesday and drive up to them on Wednesday morning.“On the day of the shooting that routine was changed which was fortunate for me and whoever was to go with me in the lorry that day. “The off licence in Derry, was due to be sold that Wednesday. If the sale went through, it meant that we would not be delivering to Derry, only Coleraine.It wasn’t until mid-afternoon that word came through that the sale went ahead. Frances Donnelly asked meI wanted to go on up to Coleraine that afternoon. As it was getting a bit late, I knew that we would not get back to the yard until after seven, so I told her that Thursday would be better. Frances gave me a choice that day and the choice that I made, saved my le.“On the Thursday morning we done a bit of tidying up around the yard and got ready to leave with the drink order.I didn’t know who was coming with me, it could have been any of the three lads, Thomas, another lad called Paul McDonald, and of course Gerard .“The owner, Sam Casey needed some pallets fixed, so that meant that Thomas was not going to go with me, because he was the best man for repairing pallets. That left two of lads to pick from, Paul and Gerard.“For some reason none of them wanted to go out that day and to settle matters Paul tossed a coin to see who had first choice, Gerard won the toss and he chose to stay in the yard. “It wasn’t really a big deal for Paul, he went into the store, got his jacket and that was us, we got into the lorry and left the yard, heading for Coleraine.”Frank and Paul headed off for Coleraine but little did they know what was to happen back in Belfast.“We found out later that we had only left the yard shortly before the gunmen arrived. For me, it was just another normal day. We were oblivious to the fact that while we were happily cruising along the motorway that gunmen had slaughtered our work colleagues and friends, back in Casey’s.“About an hour and a half after leaving Belfast I went into the off licence to speak to the manager. I took a phone call – ‘Frank, they are all dead’. I didn’t catch on what he meant, but it soon became clear and he asked who was with me. I told him that Paul was with me. “That confirmed to Vincent  that it was Thomas and Gerard who had been shot. Vincent was married to Marie, one of Sam Casey’s daughters, who worked in the upstairs office along with her sister Frances. Vincent happened to go in to the yard, unaware of what had happened, he saw one of his workers lying dead and when he went upstairs to the office he was met with an absolute blood bath. His we and her sister had been brutally murdered. “I drove back to Belfast in the lorry along with Paul, but I have absolutely no memory of the journey or the conversation between us, but I do remember going to the yard and getting the gates opened so I could drive the lorry in. “When I got into the yard there was blood everywhere, even on the fork lt. There was no one about, but I had no sooner got the lorry parked up, when newspaper reporters started to arrive outside, looking for interviews.“Thomas was seriously wounded and after treatment in hospital, was released after about two weeks. I know that Sam Casey was elated at the fact that Thomas had survived and was on the mend. Sam’s elation soon turned to deep sadness, Thomas died from his wounds exactly three weeks after he was shot.“The gunmen who went into the yard that day and shot my friends down like dogs have to bear the absolute responsibility, but fate played a role, as to who was in the yard when the murderers arrived.“The destiny of at least nine people was decided that day. The survival of the workers who would normally have been in the yard every single Thursday and the slaughter of those who happened to be there, was a matter of “s and buts” and for Gerard it was the outcome of a simple toss of a coin. “Yes, the outcome of the toss of a coin sealed Gerard’s fate, but saved the le of another worker. For Thomas, it was his skills at repairing wooden pallets that meant that he was working in the yard that morning.“I also think of the salesman who had been in the yard on business that morning and left just as we were driving out the gate. “Sam Casey, whose two daughters were murdered, would also have been in the yard that morning had he not have been in the Mater Hospital where he was recovering from a minor operation.”The tribute book will be launched this Sundayin the Mission to Seafarers Centre in Sailortown, soon after a plaque unveiling at pm at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"two hundred jobs created at springfield factory in two years","story":"THE Innovation Factory in West Belfast is celebrating the creation of more than  jobs on its second anniversary.The business hub on the Springfield Road opened in October  with the aim of encouraging entrepren-eurship, innovation, and helping new high-tech businesses to grow.The  businesses located at Innovation Factory are some of the most ground-breaking, innovative companies in the north dealing in areas such as G technology, software development, film production and digital applications.Majella Barkley, Innovation Director, said: “The key to the success of Innovation Factory has been flexibility and support modern businesses need to be able to change and adapt their environment rapidly.

Government departments carried out a fth of the procedures, % were done by non-profit organisations, and commercial organisations carried out  procedures.The harm the tests cause to animals is also broken down into categories.The highest level is severe, accounting for % of tests.These usually involve long-term disease testing and can cause \"a major departure from the animals usual state of health and well-being\" including \"animals found dead unless an informed decision can be made that the animal did not suffer severely prior to death\".Moderate tests, accounting for nearly two-thirds of experiments, cause \"a signicant and easily detectable disturbance to an animals state, but is not le threatening\".Non-recoveryis when the entire procedure is carried out under general anaesthesia without recovery.Sub-thresholdand mild procedurescause only minor and transitory discomfort.The dogs and cats involved were only subjected to mild procedures, while over , mice underwent moderate or severe procedures.Mr Agnew said more needed to be done to find alternatives to testing live animals.\"According to these stats, on average every day last year  animals were subject to often painful and damaging experiments,\" he said.\"These animals were subjected to procedures that are often painful, distressing and which cause long-term harm.\"Specically, , procedures were described as moderate or severe which inflict pain, suffering and sometimes death upon the animal.\"He added: \"Im disturbed at this rise. I want to know why we are using more animals in experiments rather than seeking alternative methods.\"Ill be writing to the permanent secretary for the Department of Health to ask how we can phase out the use of animals in these often painful and deadly experiments.\"The report states The AnimalsAct  established \"a rigorous system of controls\" for scientic work on living animals.This includes a requirement that projects and researchers are licensed as well as \"stringent safeguards on animal pain and suffering\" are in place and general requirements to ensure the care and welfare of animals.This month personal care company Unilever, which owns skincare brand Dove, called for an international ban on animal testing on cosmetics.The controversial practice has been banned in the European Union since , but research from the group Cruelty Free International suggests  million animals are still being used around the world to test beauty products every year.Humane Society International has said it hoped Unilevers stance would inspire other beauty brands to abandon animal testing completely.In September the State of Calornia announced it would ban all brands tested on animals by .The Department of Health, Queens and Ulster University had not replied to requests for a response at the time of going to press."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic updates delays and diversions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

The newly-formed Ballynahinch United played in a local summer league which involved teams such as Montalto, Drumaness Mills, Plessey, Saintfield, Magheradroll and another called the Bachelors, who apparently had an Italian playing for them.The club made their competitive debut in Division  of the Newcastle and District League in September  when they travelled to Ballykinlar Army Camp to take on the Light Infantry.This fixture would prove to be quite an ordeal in many ways with the team being beaten - as player and car owner Ted McKibbin had to make double journeys to ferry players to and from Ballykinlar.Not a single league victory was recorded that season, although they won a number of friendly games.Although the   season started more optimistically with a - draw away to Down Olympic, it was a further seven games until they defeated the RAF at Bishopscourt -. During the summer of  the team won all eight games to win the Kilmore and District Summer League.Things improved signicantly in the   season as they were promoted as runners-up in Division  and also won the Enterprise Cup, which was played on a league basis, beating Saintfield AYC ndash in the replay after a - draw in the first match.The Swts were formed for the   season and they played in the Willowfield League recording their first win against Saintfield United on October , .Having been promoted to Division  of the Newcastle  District League, they won it at the first attempt and with the Swts moving to the Newcastle League for the   season, both teams performed a unique double by winning Divisions  and  while United reached and lost the Harry Clarke Cup final.United went to the Northern Amateur Football League for the   season and were promoted from Division B and they also reached the Irish Junior Cup only to lose to Moyola Park. They won the Division A title in  In the   season they lost the Irish Junior Cup final to st Bangor Old Boys while the Swts were probably the first reserve team to reach the Harry Clarke Cup Final which they lost after a replay to Downshire Hospital.Consecutive Cochrane Corry Cup finals were lost in   and  , as well as a second County Antrim Junior Shield final in .Manager Billy Hamilton, who had guided the team through the s so successfully, stood down at the end of the   season and then went on to become secretary of the County Antrim Football Association for a number of years. The playing strength within the club led to the formation of the Albion, in .In the mid s Ballynahinch Recreation folded. United took over the Millbridge playing fields and undertook signicant development work which led to it being admitted to Division C of the Northern Amateur Football League.Under the management of Bobbie Reid, they played their first games at intermediate level in the   season while the Swts switched to the NAFL reserve section, However the Albion remained in the Newcastle League.Success came quickly when Brian McKibbenrsquos team won the Border Regiment Cup in the   season after extra-time and penalties. Brian stood down as manager in  and through the efforts of Gerry McCormick and Cyril Lennon mid-table league positions were achieved.Under the leadership of club chairman Campbell Allen, great strides were being made with improvements to the drainage of the pitch, erection of tubular steel fencing around the pitch, construction of new dugouts and the erection of floodlighting to the training pitch with the clubhouse being substantially refurbished.For the   season Noel Dean was recruited as manager and he steered the team to their first and only promotion at intermediate level when they moved from Division B to A as runners-up to Dromara Village.The following season a mid-table position was achieved together with a memorable midweek Irish Cup replay defeat of Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge.Dean stepped down during the season and he was replaced by Michael Savage, who led the team to the final of the Clarence Cup which they were awarded as a result of Knockbreda Parish fielding an ineligible player.That same season the Swts, under manager Geoffrey Smith, lost the Purdy Cup final while Davy Teggartyrsquos Albion won the Bignian Cup and were also promoted to Division  as runners-up. Sadly, this team broke up and there followed a decade of struggle during which managers Eamon Wilson, Norman McCullough, Davy Teggarty and Alan Brown worked tirelessly to halt the downward trend.The occasional bit of encouragement came along with the Albion reaching two successive Shimna Cup finals in   and   only to lose out in penalty shoot-outs while in   the Albion won the Donard Dairy Shield defeating Castlewellan IIIs ndash.Campbell Allen stepped down due to business commitments and the current chairman Gilbert Cromie took over.In May  the club were awarded the honour of hosting the Britton Rosebowl International between the NAFL and the Scottish Amateur League at Millbridge.Nigel Neale managed the team for the   season, but resigned with ten matches remaining. Experienced first teamer Alan Stevens took over, assisted by John Jones, and they led the team to one of their highest finishes in years.Former manager Cyril Lennon came in for the   season and United enjoyed their highest league position for years. Stuart Buchanan came in as manager of the Swts and led them to the Newcastle  District League Division A title.The following season United again narrowly missed out on promotion, as well as reaching the quarter-finals of the Intermediate Cup when they were defeated by Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge. The Swts re-entered the Northern Amateur League and were promoted as runners-up in Division E to Bangor Rangers.Much to everyonersquos disappointment, Cyril Lennon stepped down and Steven Bell took over along with John Jones and they led the team to a very respectable fourth place in Division B. United were awarded the North East Referees Association Merit Award for Fair Play at the AGM of the NAFL.The Swts continued their good form to finish runners-up to Downpatrick IIs in NAFL D, but manager Stuart Buchanan stepped down due to study commitments.In the summer of  the club celebrated its th anniversary which a special former playersrsquo night and a friendly match against Irish Premier League side Lisburn Distillery. The Albion managed by Johnny Reid won Division  of the Newcastle  District League.In   the club was awarded a % grant from the IFA to undertake an upgrading of its facilities to meet new Intermediate regulations.Steven Bell stood down in January . A new management team of Colin Murray and John Jones took over the role and they guided the first team to a fourth place finish on goal dference. Much to the clubrsquos disappointment the Albion had to be withdrawn from the Newcastle League due to a reduction in the clubrsquos player pool.In the   season the club embarked on its usual Irish Cup campaign little knowing that it would reach the fth round for the first time and be drawn against Premier Division side Coleraine. This brought about a wonderful adventure during which the club was able to garner a massive support which necessitated the ordering of two double decker buses for supporters as well as a bus for the team.Everything was done as professionally as possible and despite a heavy defeat, although the score was - at half time, the players and their management gained enormous respect.In more recent times the team has been managed by Keith Hamilton, Scott Brashaw and Ross Hayes as caretaker managers, Alan Davis and Paul Allison. In the current season, former player Glynn Robinson and Dale Davidson have taken on the role and have made a promising start with good results in both league and cup competition.Over the last  years the club has been involved in a number of proposed amalgamation initiatives involving Ballynahinch Recreation, Ballynahinch Olympic and Temple Rangers, but none materialised.One amalgamation that did happen was with Ballynahinch Youth Football Club, which now means that the club includes male and female from age six years forward and a ladiesrsquo senior team. This fits in superbly with the clubrsquos ethos of being inclusive to all within the local community which has been something that is reflected in its history from day one.It also brought to the club an outstanding group of coaches and administrators which has invigorated the club.No club could everwithout committed iniduals being involved in its organisation and the club has had a cadre of them over five decades.The passing of the clubrsquos elder statesman, Billy Hamilton senior, in December  brought to an end outstanding service not only within the club as a player and administrator, but also within the leagues and governing bodies.Billy was no stranger to working hard on the ground, putting up nets and marking the pitch both at Feersquos Field in Dromara and Millbridge, aided and abetted by club president Winston Brown, who works away in the background and has done so for  years.Jimmy Brown has toiled tirelessly and selflessly for well over  years, keeping Millbridge well-manicured as well as using his building, plumbing and plastering skills to maximum effect.In addition to Billy senior, the Hamilton family have made an outstanding contribution with Billy junior managing for over a decade. Graham scored hundreds of goals over those early years while Wilson mdash better known to all as Chico mdash played for all three teams and continues to serve as a committee member to the present day.We can never forget the contribution that Sally Hamilton has made as she continues to attend the home matches and has made the sandwiches served to visiting teams at the Millbridge for decades. In addition to managing the team and being involved administratively with the club, Bobbie Reid has served as the clubrsquos Newcastle League representative for many years. Last, but not least, there is Davy Teggarty, who has fulfilled every role possible.While all of these iniduals and others have helped over the years we are most fortunate to have a new generation who have stepped forward and will see the club move forward for which we are extremely thankful..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Peace lantern walk marking WWI end 100th anniversary  ","story":"A UNIQUE peace lantern walk is to be held in Killyleagh to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.The lantern will be carried in a relay chain from Shrigley to Killyleagh, and through its main streets, before a flame from it is used to light a gas beacon at the front of Killyleagh Castle on Remembrance night.A Killyleagh veteran, who is one of Northern Irelandrsquos last RAF survivors from the Second World War, has been given the honour of carrying the lantern on the final relay before the Beacon of Light is lit.Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, who is aged  and who survived more than  bombing missions as a rear gunner in Halax and Lancaster bombers in the Second World War, will light the beacon to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent in  after four years of the world at war.The Bomber Command veteran who still walks up to six miles a day and is one of Killyleaghrsquos most instantly recognisable residents, will be joined in the final relay of the cross-community walk by local schoolchildren and  unsung heroes from the local community.The Killyleagh Beacon of Light will be among the first of around  bonfires and beacons to be lit across Northern Ireland at pm at the end of Remembrance Sunday, as part of the Battlersquos Over commemorations on Sunday, November .Chris Hagan, the chairman of the Killyleagh Remembers the Great War project, revealed that an original candle and lantern, used on the th anniversary of the start of the war, will be used as part of a chain to light the beacon.ldquoWe extinguished a candle lantern in August  to mark  years from the beginning of the war, he said. ldquoIn remembrance of the end of the war and the millions who were killed or came home dreadfully wounded, the lantern will be lit again.ldquoThere were two bonfires lit in Killyleagh on the night the war ended at the Castle Square and at the Cross.

Armagh were largely at full strength with influential number  Neil Faloon passed fit.Armagh took an early lead with a penalty from promising young out-half Cormac Fox.The game then became entrenched around the halfway line with both sides either unwilling or unable to put any width on the ball due to the conditions.Armagh edged the possession and territory, but with defences well drilled on both sides it looked like only a mistake would provide any try-scoring opportunity on either side.There were a few fumbles from speculative kicks on both sides but defences were able to scramble into place and snuff out any chances relatively comfortably to leave the half-time score at -.The second half brought more of the same. Ballynahinch had to withstand a period of sustained Armagh possession, but did so without any major alarms.However, they were unable to stamp any real authority of their own on proceedings and as the match drted into its later stages it seemed that Armagh had done enough to escape with a famous win.Former Armagh man Richard Reaney had other ideas and he converted a penalty in the final minute to earn the home side a draw.Armagh will be happier with the result, but the Ballynahinch players and coaches will take the two points and move on to the tricky trip to Old Belvedere next week.The final round of the Celtic Cup took place last weekend, freeing up Ulster squad members for club rugby, but it remains to be seen how soon they become available.

A number of parked cars have also been damaged.It is being reported that some shops have closed early to protect staff, while residents who live near the historic Grove area in the shadow of Down Cathedral have revealed they have been verbally abused.Representatives from residentsrsquo groups in Stream Street, Bridge Street, Russell Park and Lynn Doyle Place have been invited to attend the meeting which they hope will result in an action plan being devised to tackle a problem caused by what some have described as ldquoferal youths.Grove Shopping Centre caretaker Peter Smyth, said businesses were frustrated that nothing is being done to address the problems and wanted local police to do more.ldquoBusinesses have had to pull down shutters either temporarily or shut early to protect staff in the St Patrickrsquos Square area, he said.ldquoWhile the trouble is largely centred on area between the Grove, the Saint Patrick Centre and the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway, it radiates out to town centre neighbourhoods and last week a number of young people climbed on to the roof at the nearby bus station.Anthony Trainor, of the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, said local people, including those who work in the town centre, have had their cars deliberately damaged.ldquoResidentsrsquo groups are telling us that there have been assaults on adults and children.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Varadkar debating the future of Europe with MEPs at the European Parliament. Photo: Photo Jean-Francois Badias Dublin is pressing for EU customs checks to treat the island of Ireland has a single unit, whereas unionists would prefer a “frictionless” soft border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland which makes no distintion between the Province and the rest of the UK.But Mr Swann said he “continue[s] to be disappointed by the intransigent language of Leo Varadkar and the Irish Government” over the issue.“If they continue to hold to the position that it’s either a border in the Irish Sea or no deal, it is likely to have dire consequences on both sides of the border in terms of both economies and relationships across these islands,” he said.“When I wrote to the Taoiseach earlier this year challenging the position which his government was taking, he responded to me saying that the Irish Government would ‘uphold and protect the letter and spirit of that Agreement’. Unfortunately, there has been little sign of that so far as he continues to push a backstop proposal which has no regard for the Belfast Agreement and the principle of consent.“I would respectfully ask the Taoiseach, along with his EU colleagues, to use the coming weeks as a window of opportunity to reflect on what they are doing and engage in negotiations which are injected with a dose of realism. Breaking the Belfast Agreement to facilitate the backstop proposal is definitely not a sensible way forward.”Mr Swann affirmed Theresa May’s actions in asking for more time to effect Brexit.“The Prime Minister was absolutely right to hold her ground and not allow the UK Government to be bounced into doing a bad deal which would threaten the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom,” he said.“There is now a window of opportunity for everyone to take stock and for the EU to go back to the drawing board. Theresa May has asked the EU for flexibility and they should give her that. It is in everyone’s interests to get a sensible deal that respects the result of the referendum, that doesn’t undermine the Belfast Agreement and maintains a frictionless border with the Republic of Ireland.”‘Leo Varadkar now reveals true goal for Northern Ireland’Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8672260.1539779519!/image/image.jpg","title":"opinion","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Opinion   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Opinion      Republicans have lost sight of founding values ndash they care only about victoryThe question on everyone#s lips in Northern Ireland is, allegedly: When will devolutionto Stormont  I have doubts as to whether the Unionist population is really as committed to ato devolution as political pundits suggest.

budget of £.m] being fully spent”.But the following day Mr Cooper changed the minutes, removing the reference to £. million and leaving it for Mr Mills to confirm what the actual budget was and asking for further confirmation of the budget figure.Mr Cooper said he was going back to Mr Mills and saying “you need to look at this again”.Keith MacLean said that Mr Cooper was signicantly expanding on what Mr Mills had actually said at the meeting and added: “Are you using the minute as a means of getting something that you want that may not have been discussed and that he may not actually agree with ”Mr Cooper said he now could not be sure what Mr Mills had said in the meeting “but I certainly wanted it to be claried”.As the minutes went through six drafts, at least one other section was added.Dame Una O’Brien said the “ex post facto resolving of action points through versions of the minutes” meant that it was impossible to be clear as to what actually was said at a meeting.RHI Inquiry: Civil servant admits removing line criticising him ‘looks bad’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It consists of three workshops: Creating a Winning Mind Winning in Communication and Winning in Business.It also includes a practical component participants must organise and produce a fundraiser event in their pub for a charity of their choice. To date the  Accelerators have raised more than pound, for UK charities between them.The guests were given a tour of the House of Commons before the main event, hosted by Luton MP Gavin Shuker. Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do. Wersquore delighted to able to recognise the achievements of our incredibly hard-working Accelerators here at the House of Commons. The course is a shining example of how commitment in personal development can change peoplersquos lives, as they fast become the companyrsquos most promising managers and future industry leaders.\"Reaching our th milestone is a really proud moment for Stonegate and the House of Commons is a fitting place to celebrate. As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He was convicted of inviting support for them.She added: ldquoIf and when any terrorist offender is released, well-rehearsed plans are put in place to keep the public safe.ldquoThe police, the prison, the probation service and other agencies have a range of powers available to them.ldquoThey also have signicant experience in dealing with such offenders.ldquoThis includes the setting of strict licence conditions, such as restrictions on movement and internet access and stringent curfews, the breach of which could result in immediate recall to prison.Choudary, , is due for automatic release after reaching the halfway point of a five-and-a-half-year sentence handed down in , when time spent on remand is taken into account.Once a leading figure in the now banned group al-Muhajiroun, the former solicitor had stayed on the right side of the law for years.For the rest of the sentence period he will be subject to a strict supervision regime.Police and MI are expected to be among a host of agencies involved in monitoring him in the community.It is thought he will initially be placed in a probation hostel following his release and will have to comply with more than  licence conditions.There are a number of standard requirements including maintaining good behaviour, receiving visits from and keeping in contact with his supervising probation officer and not travelling outside the UK without prior permission.In addition, Choudary will be subject to a bespoke package of further measures while on licence.These are expected to include electronic tagging a night-time curfew requirements to stay within a set area and only attend pre-approved mosques a ban on contacting iniduals who he knows or believes to have been charged with or convicted of extremist-related offences without prior approval, and restrictions relating to internet use and mobile device ownership.Any breach of licence conditions could result in immediateto custody.Choudary, from Ilford, east London, will be supervised under a system known as multi-agency public protection arrangements .In a separate measure, his name has been added to a UN sanctions list, which means he is subject to an assets freeze and travel ban.The plan for his release is regarded as highly sensitive and no official confirmation of the precise timing or location has been given.A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ldquoWe do not comment on iniduals.Prisons Minister Rory Stewart has previously said Choudary will be watched ldquovery, very carefully.Last week, Security Minister Ben Wallace said: ldquoWe are alert to the threat people like him pose and we will make sure we do what steps we need to mitigate it..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: PM: Authorities have power and experience to supervise Anjem Choudary article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Even aged  he was still working, enjoying meeting customers - people he always had a smile and plenty of time for.Bosco was a tall fit man, a charasmatic character who had a great sense of humour and engaging personality.He was the le and soul of a party and loved the craic.He enjoyed winding people up and could be full of devilment. He never failed to get a laugh.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.
