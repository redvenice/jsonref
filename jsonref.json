This will also apply to cohabiting friends or family.\u0027Currently, people in the UK are being told to self-isolate only if they have a persistent cough, or a high temperature, or both, or if somebody in their family does.This is based on large-scale data from China, where the most common symptoms reported are fever, a dry cough and fatigue.However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said it is investigating the link between loss of smell and taste and Covid-19.       Maria Van Kerkhove, the head of the WHO\u0027s emerging diseases and zoonoses unit, said on Monday: \u0027A loss of smell or a loss of taste is something that we\u0027re looking into.\u0027We are reaching out to a number of countries and looking at the cases that have already been reported to see if this is a common feature.

But these parcels are understood to contain only packaged foods such as soup, pasta and milk rather than fresh produce.It is hoped that some food can be used to supply the network of new temporary hospitals being set up to deal with a surge in coronavirus patients requiring treatment.John Vincent, the founder of the Leon restaurant chain, is understood to be developing an online scheme through which food from restaurants and their suppliers can be sold to members of the public.Some food wholesalers, including Brakes, have already begun selling direct to shoppers via home delivery but most are not set up for trading in this way.“Nobody wants this stuff to be thrown away,” said Andrew Kuyk, director general of the Provision Trade Federation trade body. “But there is no magic bullet.”He said suppliers and wholesalers were looking at a variety of solutions depending on the type of food they worked with and their location.Bielby agreed, saying: “Commercial hospitality demand cannot be replaced by selling to consumers. Their model is built around high volumes.” The FDW is calling for some form of tax relief on stocks it says cannot be sold. “No business wants to throw that food away but there are major issues for the stock,” Bielby said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7c525be5f72d0385c36db8d596c09e921623dcb/0_325_5436_3262/master/5436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02ea4e0c5ab12fed5ff07b8ab167774e","title":"next stops online shopping amid uk coronavirus restrictions","story":"Analysts say retailers shutdown threaten to wipe more than £11.1bn off fashion sales in 2020Next said it had taken the “difficult decision” to close its website as the coronavirus shutdown threatens to wipe more than £11bn off fashion sales this year.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

It is still trading as it seeks a buyer.Watt Brothers: The Scottish department chain had 11 stores and 306 employees when it went into administration in October 2019. All the stores closed and the majority of jobs have gone.Links of London:\u0026nbspWith 35 stores and 350 staff, the jewellery chain went into administration on 8 October 2019 but its sites are still trading.Forever 21: Had three stores and about 290 employees in the UK when it went into administration in September 2019. Stores are staying open in order to clear stock.Albemarle \u0026amp Bond: Suddenly shut all its 116 stores in September 2019 with the loss of about 400 jobs, even though it did not call in administrators. It sold its pledge books to rival H\u0026ampT in the same month.Karen Millen and Coast: Had 32 stores and 177 concessions, employing 1,100 people, when it went into administration in August 2019. All sites were closed and the vast majority of staff made redundant after the brands were bought out by online specialist Boohoo.Jack Wills: Had about 100 stores and 1,700 staff in the UK when went into administration in August 2019. Bought by Sports Direct and 98 stores are still trading in the UK and Ireland.Spudulike: Closed all 37 stores with the loss of about 300 jobs when it went into administration in August.Bathstore: Had 132 stores and 529 staff when it went into administration in June 2019. Homebase bought 44 stores saving 154 jobs and the brand now trades from 28 stores.Select: Had 180 stores and 2,000 employees when the fashion retailer went into administration in May 2019. In June administrators at advisory firm Quantuma carried out a CVA closing 11 stores with the loss of about 200 jobs.Debenhams: Had 166 department stores and more than 25,000 employees when went into administration in April 2019. No store closed immediately and the chain is now owned by its lenders but two closed before Christmas with another 20 due to shut in January when the group completes a rescue restructure expected to result in the loss of 1,200 jobs.Pretty Green: Had 12 stores and about 170 employees when Liam Gallagher’s fashion outlet went into administration in March 2019. All but one store and 33 concessions closed with\u0026nbsp100 jobs lost but 67 saved as the brand was bought by JD Sports in April.Office Outlet: All 94 stores have closed with the loss of 1,170 jobs after the stationery retailer went into administration in March 2019.LK Bennett:\u0026nbspHad 41 stores and 500 employees when it went into administration in March 2019. The brand was bought by its Chinese franchise partner, Rebecca Feng, saving 21 stores, all the group’s concessions and 325 jobs. But more than 100 jobs lost with the closure of 15 stores.Patisserie Valerie: Had 200 cafes employing nearly 3,000 people when an accounting scandal prompted the chain to call in administrators in January 2019. About 70 of the group’s 200 stores closed immediately with the loss of 900 jobs. About 2,000 jobs were saved when about 100 Patisserie Valerie cafes were rescued by Causeway Capital, more than 20 of which have since closed. 21 Philpotts sandwich shops were bought by AF Blakemore \u0026amp Son. and four Baker \u0026amp Spice cafes a were bought by the Department of Coffee \u0026amp Social Affairs.Sarah ButlerOrmrod said: “Amid a UK lockdown and self-isolation, buying new clothes and footwear is far from a top priority for consumers, making springsummer a season to forget for fashion retailers – but one with long-lasting consequences.”Next had already predicted that disruption stemming from the outbreak could wipe £1bn off this year’s sales while Primark has been desperately trying to cancel orders placed with suppliers. With its stores – and now its website - out of action, Next has been trying to delay orders and is considering leasing extra warehousing to hold stock flowing into the business.The forced closure of all non-essential shops by the government is a fresh blow for a high street which was already struggling as weak consumer spending was compounded by the shift to online spending. The scale of high street decline was spelled out by new research from the advisory firm Deloitte which showed that a net total of 9,169 stores closed in the UK last year, which was a fifth more – the equivalent of 1,619 stores – than in 2018. That is the equivalent of 25 stores a day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9cd2ac3d299020500a97a36a19303c9eb2c57af/0_416_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b73a705ff1ca1afa2d982d7d3269268","title":"covid 19 help should only go to financially sound businesses","story":"Debt-laden shopping centre landlord Intu seems to be hoping to get access to government support packageHere’s how the government’s £330bn loan package for British businesses could become very messy: if the state ends up supporting the likes of Intu Properties, the deeply debt-laden shopping centre landlord that failed to fix its balance sheet in happier times.Intu, to state the obvious, was not healthy. The owner of the Lakeside centre in Essex and the Trafford centre near Manchester has £4.5bn of borrowings the stock market values the equity at just £50m and the company last month failed to land a £1.5bn refinancing from its shareholders, thereby creating a “material uncertainty” over its future.Yet here’s a line from Intu’s trading update on Thursday: “We have an ongoing dialogue with the UK government and may look to access their £330bn support package.” But how? The package is not meant for companies that were already teetering on the brink.Come on, though, there is a limit to what the government’s bridging efforts can be expected to support. If the crisis lasts for months and months, then, yes, the short-term cashflow worries of commercial landlords could become a wider issue. But we’re not there yet.British Land and almost every other large commercial landlord is able to absorb a temporary hit to rental income. Intu is less able to do the same because its capital structure was unstable long before coronavirus struck. Piling yet more debt onto the current huge pile would not be useful.Intu’s crisis is one for its current lenders to tackle, as it always was. Thursday’s statement also said the company is seeking waivers on loan covenants from its banks. Good: that is the right approach.The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, should stay well away. There are many more deserving cases than Intu to support.In fact, the urgent problem with the Treasury package is the hole in the middle. Medium-sized companies are too large for the coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, where loans are up to £5m, but many will feel the CCFF is not aimed at them.You can see their point. The CCFF language is all about public credit ratings, an unknown world for, say, a family-owned business with a turnover of £100m. Applicants are allowed to use a current lender’s internal credit rating or get a rating agency to make an assessment, but those are also unfamiliar hurdles.The Treasury may have to show flexibility and imagination. It can lambast banks to lend more, but some of the red tape is of its own making.What you need to be an auditor? Professional scepticism is the basic skill – and one lacking in too many cases in recent years. Now an ability to operate a drone could be handy.To be clear, drone-control is not yet a necessary requirement. It’s just an example of what the Financial Reporting Council means by “alternative procedures” that auditors can use to seek evidence to support an audit opinion. If a conventional stock-take is impossible because premises are locked down under coronavirus restrictions, send in a flying machine with a camera.Regulatory encouragement of such lateral-thinking should be welcomed. When uncertainties lie in every direction, there is a risk that auditors become inclined to take too much on trust. It would be a disaster if the definition of “fair and true” becomes watered down at the moment when companies’ “going concern” statements are about to become the most scrutinised part of the accounts.The authorities’ bigger reform was to give companies six months after their financial year-end, instead of four, to publish audited numbers. That move seems sensible too: better to be accurate than fast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b8da8c3000f9bde0ac7cc99eaf628e2c8133e4f/0_278_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11dfd065cf7cda0bc6cb9eb131f1a5f0","title":"britain covid 19 predictions","story":"Beware confident predictions of our future after the Covid-19 crisis. Our response to seismic change is often to entrench existing views If there is one thing everyone living through the Covid-19 emergency agrees, it is that it is unprecedented. Everyone is surely right about that. But what follows in politics, economics and social behaviour from that recognition? There is no agreement there. There are resemblances with wartime, of course, but Britain never went into almost total lockdown in wartime. There are echoes of past pestilences too, but these afflictions did not bring normal life to such a totalising standstill.And these are only early days in a long process. Politicians are no better than anyone else at adjusting to radical change. As Boris Johnson’s uncertain initial messaging exemplified, adjustment takes time. The worst of the crisis is also yet to come. Covid-19 cases and deaths have not yet peaked. The outbreak may drag on for longer than we have yet grasped, or it may return. Pretending that life could be back to normal by Easter, as Donald Trump does, is delinquent. If the 1918-19 flu pandemic is a guide, the Covid-19 virus may be with us for a year.This length and seriousness mean that none of us yet knows what the final accounting on the Covid-19 crisis will look like. But we can say that we are likely to be living with some of the pandemic’s consequences for years to come. The issues that could endure are many. They start with the shared experience of having the shadow of death hanging over our heads. They include, additionally, the impact of the massive public health emergency itself, the many transformations of everyday living, the state’s mobilisation to defend the economy, and the general anxiety about the future that is laid bare in an Ipsos-Mori survey this week. None of these is likely to be gone by Christmas, never mind by Easter. Faced with an extraordinary event, it is natural to think it will have extraordinary long-term consequences too. Nevertheless, much of the speculation about this is struggling to adjust. Its feet are still firmly planted in the past. It is largely conditioned by earlier political isions such as Brexit. In some cases, the pandemic is merely vindicating whatever the thinker believed in the first place, before the outbreak began. All the pandemic has done is make them believe it more strongly than ever.There are three obvious problems with such an approach. The first is it assumes the pandemic will cause the scales to fall from the eyes of those who do not share it. But this may not happen. The second is that it fails to take account of how the public mood will change once the pandemic ceases. And it will. The third is that it avoids self-questioning.Both left and right are currently guilty of acting as though nothing has really changed. Those on the left who believed before Covid-19 that Britain was collapsing under the weight of social inequality, a lack of Keynesian demand management or the folly of Brexit have looked at the crisis and concluded that, yes, the pandemic proves that they were right all along. Yet those on the right who believed beforehand that the economy was more reliably run in their hands, that borders needed to be rather more tightly controlled, and that nation states must make their own decisions feel equally vindicated.In the same way, when it comes to attitudes towards inidual politicians, Johnson’s admirers now admire him even more than ever, while his detractors denounce him even more indignantly. It seems obvious to his critics that Johnson is the wrong man for the crisis and equally obvious to them that he is mishandling it so badly he may be overthrown. But the opinion polls don’t say that. A lot of people elected Johnson in December and even more think he is doing a good job now. Everyone in these debates could use a bit of humility and a dose of open-mindedness. That’s true on both sides. It’s true for all of us. The right has been forced to relearn the prime importance of the state as guarantor in a period of emergency. It is having to accept the state’s irreducible responsibility to the most vulnerable. It has also, perhaps, learned that what a health service can achieve reflects the investment that has been made in it, although no health service anywhere has been or could have been fully prepared.But the left has lessons to learn too. Many of the takeaways from the Covid-19 crisis may seem obvious. But what is true during a crisis is not necessarily true or desirable when the crisis is over. The NHS needs whatever it takes in a crisis, but at other times health service spending is as long as a piece of string and there has to be a cut-off point, if only to allow spending elsewhere. The borrowing that may or may not save the economy from recession in a crisis will also have to be paid for when the crisis is over. People may trust Johnson with powers they would not want Jeremy Corbyn to possess.We are sailing in the dark towards an unknown future. Britain’s mood after the first world war and the flu pandemic has been described by the historian Richard Overy as “the morbid age”. It was, Overy says, an era of fear and paranoia about a dystopian future. Few put their faith in traditional politics. Britain after the second was very different. “Never again” was its more optimistic motto. No one can say which of these moods, or what other mood, is likely after the Covid-19 pandemic . Instead of insisting that the pandemic confirms everything we thought beforehand, it would be better to start thinking about all the unwelcome changes that the pandemic may bring in the decade to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55420aff1007bbc8ea15f7602e3e0f4b51c165a8/0_76_4484_2690/master/4484.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b2b91ef3c90fd18c4d5627f588f9bbb","title":"coronavirus prince charles covid 19 test old divisions","story":"The virus is throwing familiar inequalities into sharp relief – and may force us to confront some new ones, tooWe are all still in this together. But some of us are now falling so much deeper into it than others.What finally made me cry this week was a picture shared by a Canadian doctor, of four little girls waving through a window. This is the only way she will see her two daughters until it’s over, she wrote. She has sent them to stay with their cousins, to protect them from any infection she could unwittingly bring home from treating the sick and the dying.In Britain too, some medical staff are making the agonising decision to live apart from pregnant partners, while teachers caring for key workers’ children shove work clothes in the wash at the end of the day and try not to think about what could be lingering on them. Yet still key workers can’t get tested – even when they start showing symptoms – to confirm whether they pose a risk, either to those they help or to their own families. For now, precious laboratory time is reserved for those sick enough to come into hospital.No wonder some were furious, then, when it emerged that Prince Charles had been tested despite suffering from what’s said to be only a mild case of coronavirus. Buckingham Palace insists it was done for sound clinical reasons, and even if it wasn’t, one princely test makes no practical difference to the ability of hundreds of thousands of key workers to get one.But this spasm of public anger is a warning sign, nonetheless. It suggests we’re moving into a dangerous new stage of this epidemic, one where heartwarming stories of hope and altruism – small children pogoing manically to Joe Wicks’ free live-streamed PE lessons every morning, almost half a million people volunteering overnight to run errands for the vulnerable – may give way to something darker.Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall – who left London for the Balmoral estate only hours before the government instructed everyone else not to flee to the country, for fear of spreading infection or overloading rural health services – aren’t alone in hightailing it out of town. While the super-rich seek to ride out the epidemic in hastily rented moated mansions, or on deserted tropical islands, the weekending middle classes have quietly decamped to second homes in Devon or Norfolk or Cumbria.Houses that normally sit shuttered and forlorn until Easter started opening up again the minute the schools shut – and so many people have been trying to book hideaway cottages on remote Scottish islands that ferry crossings are being restricted. Tiny communities with no cases of their own are understandably afraid of what wealthy urban refugees may bring with them, and fear curdles all too easily into resentment.But the age-old ide between town and country isn’t the only one at risk of widening. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, today moved a long way to bridging an emerging gap between the conventionally employed (whose salaries will be part-guaranteed by the state if their jobs are frozen) and the anxiously self-employed, who are now promised a similarly generous lifeline. The latter may have to wait until early June for the money, with the universal credit system buckling under the strain of new claims, however, and isn’t for the highest earners meanwhile, Sunak hinted the quid pro quo could be reform of tax perks for the self-employed after we emerge from this crisis.The safety net knitted last week at breakneck speed, meanwhile, is already starting to fray at the edges. Renters worry that their three-month reprieve from eviction might not be as watertight as it looked older people, told they can stay in and simply order food online, are being left with little choice but to venture out when supermarket delivery slots are booked solid for weeks.So far, this virus is mainly exposing isions that we already knew existed. We hardly needed a virus to tell us that the royals are privileged, work is precarious for many, and some families have resources others don’t – whether that’s a cottage by the sea, a back garden to play in, or the skills to teach their own children. Kids whose parents are now raiding the internet for kitchen science experiments will lose less ground academically over this long summer than those whose parents struggle with basic maths themselves – widening attainment gaps that were stubborn enough before.But as time goes on, this virus may create unexpected new ides too. We desperately need mass antibody testing, said to be only weeks away, to establish who has already had the virus and might now be immune, on top of the existing tests showing who has it now. Reliable testing would let key workers go back to the frontline – or in some cases back home – and others return to the kind of non-essential jobs that keep an economy ticking over. But testing could also turn us overnight into a society of had-its and haven’t-yets: the former free to roam the outside world again and the latter still stuck indoors, worrying about their jobs. We can overcome this ide, like any ide, given far-sighted political leadership and inidual generosity, but only if we see it coming.It may seem churlish to dwell on what ides us rather than what we are discovering we have in common. But the lesson of an epidemic that has seen doctors raiding DIY stores for protective masks, and children separated from their mothers by cold hard glass, is that it pays to be one step ahead, not running to catch up that where we are now is not necessarily where we will be tomorrow. A crisis that has so far brought us together may soon, if we’re not careful, begin to push us apart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e9fc1e11c327c5bc57ea8c09821dab24e9452fc/0_175_7043_4226/master/7043.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff51b8c27972fccffdc709f3f64e8386","title":"rishi sunak welfare state chancellor self employed benefits system","story":"The chancellor’s help for the self-employed is timely. But many will be at the mercy of a decimated benefits system“There are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks where decades happen,” as Lenin once said, and never have those words been so apt.Yet for all the talk of unprecedented measures, some things don’t change. Millions remain left out of the government’s economic response to the pandemic, and for the most part they are the same communities who have been neglected again and again over the past decade.The two major schemes announced to date have significant holes. All employees who have lost their job since the outset of social distancing, or who will do so before the end of April, are cast adrift. And those that see their employers cut their hours but not their entire job, will not be picked up by the schemes either.Self-employed workers will have to survive more than two months with little additional protection – beyond entitlement to temporary tax deferral and loans – until the new income protection scheme is operational from the beginning of June. For many, that won’t come soon enough to keep them afloat – and they will instead have to turn to the UK’s threadbare social security system, joining the millions who are already reliant on either universal credit or our legacy benefit system.These are not mere speculative or marginal gripes. In just nine days, almost 500,000 people have had to apply for universal credit. The system, already fraught with error and failings, is now straining under the pressure. Those that are able to get through the digital queues that stretch into the hundreds of thousands will be met with one of the weakest safety nets among advanced economies globally, and in the UK’s own postwar history.It is true that universal credit has been temporarily strengthened in response to the present crisis, with an increase in the main adult payment by around £20 per week. But this £7bn injection of cash amounts to just one fifth of the cuts to welfare seen since 2010. Few people can truly survive off the 90-odd quid a week that awaits those whose finances have been crippled by the present recession – and this was as true for the disabled and unemployed before this month, as it will be true for everyone over the coming weeks.The chancellor will have plenty of plaudits for today’s announcement, and many of them will be justified. But you can’t simply rebuild a safety net in a week after destroying it for a decade. The interventions to date are as unprecedented as they are welcome. But they are also incomplete. The job is not finished.

They were told several people had fallen ill, and it was their job to piece together various fragments of information – about symptoms, timings and locations – to work out what might have happened.We face the same challenge with every outbreak: we never have a single perfect dataset early on. Instead, we have to combine the information we do have to work out what might really be happening.First, let’s look at what the Oxford team actually did. Its analysis focused on deaths in the UK and Italy. If we view the data in isolation, there are several scenarios that could potentially be consistent with the observed pattern of deaths. Perhaps there are lots of infections and a low severity. Or fewer infections and a higher severity.The Oxford researchers suggested there were multiple scenarios that could explain the deaths reported in the UK, including those in which there have been a huge number of infections that haven’t been detected. The media picked up on the most extreme of these scenarios, which implied the majority of the UK had already been infected. But remember, this analysis focused solely on deaths – and that’s not the only data we have for Covid-19.There are now several datasets that suggest many infections come with symptoms, particularly in older groups, and hence it is less likely that there are vast numbers of infections going undetected. Such datasets include testing on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, testing of passengers on evacuation flights, the age pattern of Covid-19 cases, and infections detected among contacts of cases.We still don’t know the exact risk, and we won’t until we have the results from a large-scale analysis of blood samples. But the early pieces of information we do have suggest that this is an infection that can cause a large amount of severe disease, and the majority of the UK population are still susceptible to it.

Forced by the coronavirus pandemic to shut up shop, the Museum Catharijneconvent in Utrecht is offering a taste of its latest exhibition on miracles and their depiction in art through a phone line.Option one for callers is to hear all about a miracle experienced by a staff member, Simone, who survived the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean. Option three is for callers to record their own description of a miraculous experience, potentially to be showcased in the exhibit.But in these troubling times it may be option two – the chance to request one’s very own supernatural event – that will prove the most popular. “Do you want to experience a miracle?” callers are asked.“It was just a bit of a joke before the coronavirus,” said Rosa van der Wielen, a spokeswoman for the museum. “But it would be very nice now if people put their requests on the website, that would be a very good idea.”It is yet to be seen how many people avail themselves of the option in the weeks and months to come. Some technical problems temporarily put the line out of action on Thursday, but the subject matter of the museum’s exhibition may feel prescient to many.The All Wonders exhibition was due to be opened to the public at the end of this month but its launch has been delayed until June at least in light of measures to try to halt the spread of Covid-19.The lack of firm evidence of the existence of miracles obliged the museum to retain a healthy scepticism. Artworks included in the exhibition include depictions of Lazarus in an etching by Rembrandt and in a lifesize painting by the 17th-century painter Carel Fabritius. Visitors can watch a clip from the music video for Lazarus by David Bowie, a track recorded shortly before his death in 2016.But the museum had wanted to explore all avenues, including “miracles” whose authenticity had been questioned. The curators explored whether it was possible to include a 1937 painting, The Holy Virgin of Welberg by Wijnand Geraedts, depicting Janske Gorissen, a young woman from the Dutch village of Welberg.Gorissen claimed to have had visions of Mary and the archangel Gabriel in the 1930s. Her bedroom became a site of pilgrimage to thousands. But due to growing doubts over the story, a Vatican commission in 1951 eventually concluded that no miracle had occurred.“Unfortunately, the bishop of Breda has put the painting and all archive documents of this case under lock and key,” one of the curators, Marije De Nood, told De Volkskrant newspaper. “No one is allowed to see the painting.”A second controversial miracle is thoroughly explored, however. In the early 1930s, five young children from Beauraing, a city in Belgium, claimed to have seen the Virgin Mary. They appeared to go into ecstasy when they prayed.To test whether the children were lying, doctors put a burning match on the hand of Gilberte Degeimbre, who at the age of nine was the youngest girl in the group. Gilberte was said not to have sustained any burns, and the bishop of Namur confirmed the supernatural nature of the experience in 1949. Degeimbre died in 2015 at the age of 92. Clothes she wore as a child will be part of the show."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3deba7810ab84c6557c86e722d28ac38ac576b3f/420_252_4786_2874/master/4786.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=538171e622cabc8cef2243ad1e81b0ab","title":"how to study at home during coronavirus by online students and tutors","story":"Here’s how to study effectively from home, according to those who have been doing it all alongFor Dafydd Evans, 21, who studies media production at De Montfort University, online teaching has got off to a good start. “I didn’t think the new systems would cope, but they have,” he says. “We have contact with academics as normal and I really don’t think there’s much I’m missing out on.”Others, however, say it’s been an uphill struggle. “The sites are crashing and lecturers are struggling to turn face-to-face interactions into online discussions,” says Isabel Thomas (not her real name), who studies international development at the University of Sussex. “We don’t all log on at the same time as some don’t have stable enough internet connection for live chats.

If your study space is now the kitchen table, try to get an agreement that it is yours alone for a set time period.It’s hard to be disciplined to work at home, and even harder if the place is cluttered. “If you have piles of dishes or laundry around you it can be difficult to focus. I like to set a timer for 15 minutes and do a quick blitz of a room. It makes for a calmer environment,” says Kimberley Lowe, who studied Spanish and English at the Open University.Although you may miss campus and socialising in person, reaching out and connecting with staff and other students can maintain a sense of community. Use the online systems to maintain social contact. Stephane Bignoux, senior lecturer in management at Middlesex University, says although it can feel lonely, posting on discussion boards and reading other student’s posts can help. Set up informal discussions via Skype or FaceTime if you can.Not everyone has access to a laptop and reliable wifi. Some students are relying on mobile data to connect to their online lessons and many are missing physical resources such as the library and laboratories. Get in touch with your university if you don’t have access to the right equipment. “We are telling staff to make content easy to view and interact with on smartphones. It needs to be much more inclusive,” says Neil Morris, dean of digital education at the University of Leeds.Recognise that different tasks require different levels of concentration. Watching a video can be easier than reading a complex text and taking notes. Divide your work in to manageable time slots and take proper breaks. The fact that you can put off watching recorded lectures until later can be dangerous. Make sure you devote your full attention to the recording – don’t squeeze it in while eating or listening to music. Set a routine to use time efficiently, says Jack Yarrow, 28, a final year engineering student at the Open University. “If you’re tired or not feeling great don’t just sit there – go tidy up, and when you’re feeling more awake, apply yourself then.”As with other social media platforms, a simple misunderstanding in writing can quickly escalate. “What may have been intended as an ironic comment can be misinterpreted,” warns Weller.On discussion forums you may find that some who don’t speak up in class have more to say – which is a good thing. “My course generally don’t interact that much in lectures, but the interaction with online teaching has been constant,” says Evans. “It seems hiding behind the screen brings out confidence in our generation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82da8591f69f29abfd583c75873ac6e881a74db9/0_322_4827_2896/master/4827.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=319f9745547b64abb4da29e363937d94","title":"pollutionwatch why cycling is better for you in 99 of worlds cities","story":"While pollution and road safety are concerns, the benefits of riding a bike generally outweigh the risksNew York has reported a surge in cycling as people try to avoid public transport during the coronavirus epidemic. In New York City, Mexico City, and Bogotá city authorities are planning “emergency” cycleways.London has made its bike hire scheme free to health workers, and bicycle shops have been listed as essential businesses to remain open while other shops are closed. But many people are reluctant to take to their bikes because they think it is more dangerous than other ways of travelling. Setting aside Covid-19, studies done during more normal times show that the health benefits from cycling outweigh the downsides – namely breathing polluted air (cyclists breath faster than those in cars or walking) and accidents, but this varies from place to place. None of these are in Europe or the Americas. Future investment in cycle infrastructure could decrease accidents and improve the benefits ratio even further."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78544985e31e62c4f749e1f5dd59d3d45371a827/0_0_2480_3684/master/2480.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e691eaeaa7e30eeb1e1ec22367a1686a 1400w","title":"tom hanks 25 best performances ranked","story":"The actor was one of the first celebrities to contract coronavirus. To celebrate his recovery, we round up his finest performances Yikes. This was one of the Hankster’s two directorial credits and it is a dull and lifeless autumn-years romcom, with Hanks playing opposite Julia Roberts, who is every bit as uneasy as the man himself.Hanks has a cameo as a dead Elvis Presley impersonator here ironic, as he got Covid-19 while on location in Australia filming Baz Luhmann’s Elvis biopic, in which he was due to play Presley’s manager, Colonel Tom Parker.Hanks is the dashing Harvard symbologist Dr Robert Langdon, who deciphers occult signs in Renaissance artworks about Jesus in these clunky adaptations of the bestsellers by Dan Brown (whose books had specified that the hero resembled Harrison Ford).A nosy suburbanite obsessed with his neighbours’ supposed dirty dealings? That’s the role here with which Hanks does his best. Maybe it would have worked better if he was the straightahead good guy whose innocent pastimes were misinterpreted.A darker role for Hanks notable, although it doesn’t really play to his strengths. He plays a mob hitman in 1930s Chicago who, with his small son in tow, is going to track down the guys who killed most of his family. A high-minded oddity on his CV.Clint Eastwood directed Hanks in this true-life hagiopic about the heroic airline pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger III who, with staggering coolness under pressure, landed his damaged US Airways Flight 1549 on New York’s Hudson river and got all 155 passengers and crew off unscathed, only later to suffer an investigation from the contemptible pen-pushers and corporate bean-counters. Not a bad role for Hanks, but it doesn’t quite come to life.Hanks is the cool counterweight to a young Leonardo DiCaprio here he plays the stolid, even-tempered FBI man on the trail of DiCaprio’s notorious teenage conman in this stranger-than-fiction true story. While DiCaprio fakes being a lawyer or an airline pilot, Hanks is the authentic authority figure, who seems to have a sneaking admiration for DiCaprio’s ingenious illegal hi-jinks.Playing opposite a big adorable dog is something only an adorable actor can do. Hanks plays a cop called Turner, who has to take care of a big, sloppy lovable dog called Hooch who is the only witness to his owner’s murder. There is joint relatability and some inter-species chemistry, it has to be admitted, and this film played an important part in establishing Hanks’s brand identity.Again, it is weird here to see Hanks play someone who is not the good guy. He is playing something of a cynical slimeball in this true-life political drama from the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and the director Mike Nichols. Hanks is the 80s Reagan-era congressman Wilson who masterminded the covert war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. He brings natural charisma and presence, but the part-sentimental-part-cynical vibe feels wrong.Hanks is not like Meryl Streep: accents are not his thing. But here he is giving us an outrageous Ryussh-yun ick-syent as a wacky innocent from a fictional ex-Soviet state who has to live hobo-ishly in New York’s JFK airport terminal building when a coup back home renders him stateless. Stanley Tucci plays the flustered immigration officer who has to deal with him. As so often in Hanks’s CV, his mojo would work better as the kindly authority figure.Robert Zemeckis’s film, with Hanks as the FedEx employee who is marooned on a desert island, is taken very seriously by Hanks fans the initial “crash” scene is certainly a corker, and Hanks is also a likable castaway with his tattered trousers and straggly beard, capering with self-congratulatory delight when he makes fire for the first time. But there is something a bit silly about this with anyone less seductive than Hanks, it would have sunk.In his senior years, Hanks has a new mastery of playing iconic real-life figures who are part of the US’s pop-cultural landscape. Here he is playing Walt Disney really, no other casting was possible. He is the kindly, persistent movie impresario persuading Emma Thompson’s cantankerous author PL Travers into letting him do a film version of her creation Mary Poppins. As ever, Hanks is a genius at embodying pure likability and his Disney has to be a nice guy (there is no question of mentioning the darker sides to Disney’s personality). In fact, most people will assume that Disney was naturally like Tom Hanks.Maybe it is wrong to bracket these together, at least partly because Sleepless in Seattle is appreciably better: lighter of touch, lighter in heart. In SiS, Hanks is still in his big-haired younger-man mode, but by YGM, he is older with smaller hair. But, of course, it is still very much Hanks in each case conducting a poignantlyhilariously long-range relationship with Meg Ryan and jointly becoming the nation’s sweethearts. They work well together, without a doubt. Hanks is an actor born to work with Steven Spielberg in many ways, he is the actorly embodiment of what Spielberg is as a director, and he gives a richly entertaining and watchable performance as the renowned Washington Post editor and liberal lion Ben Bradlee, sparring amiably with his boss Kay Graham (Streep) as they chase the Pentagon Papers scoop in 1971, which paved the way for the paper’s Watergate investigation. In this role, Hanks delivers pure Jimmy Stewart decency straight into your veins.A great early role for the boyish and unthreateningly cherubic Hanks, who at the time was considered by some pundits insufficiently like a leading man. He is the single guy who falls for the mermaid who saves him from drowning and who comes to Manhattan to get wet and reveal her true nature in his bathtub – although the film adroitly swims around the potential for smut. Darryl Hannah is terrific in this (and there is a Hollywood sexism story to be told in the list of Hanks’s female leads whose careers have faded while his has motored ever onward). Hanks first sneakily gained cinemagoers’ love in this film, as the boy-next-door who is the man-next-door.A key moment in Hanks’s early-90s golden age, winning an Oscar in this courtroom drama for playing a gay man who contracts HIV and sues his employer for wrongful dismissal. In some ways, the film conforms to the “liberal balancing” template by pairing Hanks with Denzel Washington as his personal-injury lawyer who is a soon-to-be-reformed homophobe, and there is a new debate now about straight actors playing gay. But nothing could have signalled empathy and respect more clearly than casting Hanks. It is a Hollywood “issue” movie, yes, with the self-consciousness that this implies but Hanks brings intelligence and sensitivity.You do not expect to see Tom Hanks in an action movie, but that is what’s happening in this gripping hijack thriller from the director Paul Greengrass, based on a true story. Hanks plays the merchant navy captain in charge of a colossal container ship as it sails round the Horn of Africa, a great big slow-moving easy target for Somali pirates with semi-automatic rifles, motivated by poverty. Hanks gives a great performance as the authority figure under stress the good guy who, like everyone else, is at the mercy of the vast globalised forces of capital.This fantasy comedy, directed by Penny Marshall and written by Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg (sister of Steven), features Hanks in his über-Hanks role, the breakout part that really did put him on the map. It is a role that speaks to everyone who feels in their heart that they are impostors, deeply implausible as adults and basically bewildered (or excited) little kids. Hanks plays Josh Baskin, the boy who resents the rules laid down for kids, wishes to be big and then … well … be careful what you wish for. Like no one else, Hanks could persuasively embody an adult with adult presence who is nonetheless someone with a child’s innocence and fun. (Try to imagine Tom Cruise doing it, and you realise how quickly it could be a scary movie.) It is never better demonstrated than in the giant toy piano scene, with Hanks joyously dancing on the keys.Another great Spielberg-Hanks pairing, with Hanks rising to the challenge of a big movie on a big subject. He is the everyman hero Captain Miller in the second world war after D-day who leads a platoon whose purpose is to find Private Ryan (Matt Damon) on the field of battle and order him home on compassionate grounds, because all his brothers have been killed. Importantly, Miller is not a professional soldier, but a teacher in civilian life, someone who feels the burden of leadership keenly, but with great modesty and seriousness: a matter of civic values rather than macho heroism. He also has to try concealing that he has a tremor in his hand. The paradox of Hanks is that he is pure Hollywood star quality mixed with self-effacement and it works very well in a drama where the huge impacts of warfare distract you from the acting.One of the very few Hanks movies in his later period in which he goes toe-to-toe with an actor of equal heavyweight stature – and the result is a balanced double act, rather than a Hanks leading turn. Mark Rylance plays the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in early 60s America, whom the US government was about to hand over to the Russians in a spy-swap at the Glienicke bridge linking east and west Berlin, the “bridge of spies”. This hair-raisingly dangerously manoeuvre is planned by Abel’s modest but courageous lawyer James Donovan, played of course by Hanks a man whose amateur enthusiasm and impulsiveness marks him out as a non-diplomat, but someone who nonetheless gets things done. Hanks’s Donovan is superb: homely, wily and sweet, an inspired straight man to the deadpan humour of Rylance’s spy. “Aren’t you worried?” Hanks asks Rylance, who comes back with: “Would it help?”“There’s no crying in baseball!” Hanks delivers a classic axiom in this Penny Marshall gem, about the foundation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League during the second world war. He is the grumpy former baseball star who hit the skids due to booze, and is now given his comeback chance by managing what he derisively thinks is an absurd novelty: a female baseball team, featuring Geena Davis, Rosie O’Donnell and Madonna. It’s when he yells at right-fielder Evelyn Gardner (played by Bitty Schram) for screwing up that she begins to cry, and he lets her have it with that iconic line. Perhaps this is the one and only time that Hanks fully inhabits an unsympathetic role, and that is probably only because we know it’s just temporary, and that he is basically a fatherbrother figure, subordinate to the women and bound to be redeemed by them.If Hanks has a late-period masterpiece, it is his extraordinary work in this film about the real-life US children’s TV presenter Fred Rogers in the late-90s, when he was sliding out of fashion and a little derided by the media establishment. However, he succeeds in profoundly impressing a cynical hardbitten magazine journalist (played by Matthew Rhys) who has come to interview him. This is a genuinely complex, difficult-to-read performance from Hanks, who creates an amazingly detailed, eccentric collection of physical and vocal mannerisms based on the real Rogers, quite different from the aw-shucks routine that people might more readily associate with him. It is especially amazing when he asks Rhys to remain absolutely silent with him over lunch in a restaurant for a solid minute so that they can reflect on the people important to them.Look upon the colossal importance of Forrest Gump in Hanks’s career and in 90s Hollywood generally, ye mighty arbiters of taste, and despair! If not despair, exactly, then sadly concede the massive showbusiness firepower that Hanks brought to this folksy parable of … what exactly? Robert Zemeckis (second only to Marshall and Spielberg as a Hanks director) shot this Zelig-ish, or John Irving-ish story of a young man growing up in the 50s with learning difficulties (as no one then phrased it) and a low IQ, whose essential innocence, niceness and luck cause him to rise to greatness, with a college football career, distinguished service in Vietnam, mastery of table-tennis, a thriving shrimp-fishing business and then brilliance in stock-market investment – and he becomes a national celebrity for running across the whole country. It is the walk and halting voice that nail it (he was to modify it a little bit, arguably, for his performance in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood). Forrest Gump was made in Bill Clinton’s 90s, but Gump is pure Reagan: the simple patriot who wins through.The pure essence of Hanks is distilled for his inspired vocal role as Woody in Pixar’s glorious animated Toy Story movies. He voices the pull-string cowboy figure who is the favourite toy of Andy, but in danger of being supplanted in his affections by astronaut Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen), just as westerns were supplanted by space-race-inspired sci-fi in America’s heart generally. Hanks’s vocal work in these movies is a total joy, and it is one of the most heartwarming, heartrending pieces of casting in Hanks’s career. It also puts him under pressure as an actor in a way few of his other films have, especially in TS2, when his old toy comrades tell him to forget about being the favourite of fickle kids and instead embrace being the pampered possession of adult collectors, because children will only break your heart. There is greatness in this.Something very, very wrong has happened and the whole world holds its breath. The Nasa moon missions, which the US and every other country had come to take for granted as an untarnished, ongoing success, look like becoming a terrible catastrophe. In 1970, the Apollo 13 spacecraft suffers an onboard explosion on its way to the moon, depriving it of most of its electric power and oxygen. There is every chance its astronauts will die, in real time, on national television. Who can save them and all of us? Who can pluck a pyrrhic victory from this defeat?The answer of course is the solid, dependably heroic Hanks, playing Apollo 13’s modest commander Jim Lovell, on whose memoir this movie is based. It is directed with a sure hand by Ron Howard, creating a wonderfully well-made, suspenseful, exciting, poignant Hollywood classic. Hanks is an actor who has something Nasa-ish in his own professionalism, a guy who has refined and fortified his technique over a long period of time and just gets on with it. Cleverly, it is the calm and unshowy Hanks who negotiates the loss of innocence involved in all this: the Apollo 13 near-miss was the event that showed that the US was not all-powerful and also caused the country to begin losing interest in moon landings.Importantly, Hanks leads the operation that brings Apollo 13 and its pilots back, unharmed, and brings our idealism back to Earth as battered but also unharmed. This was a heroic adventure, given an added piquancy by the fact that they didn’t get what they wanted. And Hanks embodies all of this: tough, resourceful, a leader, a pragmatist and a modest hero."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1451275b23dc4c2cbf199ed2306f2455a6a4b501/0_192_2284_1371/master/2284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88d435d4e79086cb68de0b10c30f9ffb","title":"tom hooper cats commentary deepens the mystery","story":"The man behind the much-maligned musical film has shared some of its secrets – prepare to be baffledTom Hooper, the Oscar-winning director of The King’s Speech, has revealed some of the logic behind the creative choices guiding his most recent film, Cats.A starry version of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s hit stage musical, Cats primarily met with ridicule, nausea and confusion when it premiered just before Christmas last year. Critics queried the special effects and eroticism, audiences largely stayed away and some of the stars disowned the film.Hooper’s director’s commentary, recorded for the film’s home entertainment release, sheds light on some of the decisions behind what is regarded as one of the most calamitous missteps in movie history.Though Hooper does not directly address the film’s reception on the audio track, some of his insights defend - or defer – widely reviled choices, including the moment where Rebel Wilson’s tabby cat unzips her own fur – to reveal a further layer of further beneath.“This gag,” says Hooper, “is kind of my own tongue-in-cheek way of referencing that I’m using digital fur as clothing because Rebel actually unzips her digital fur to reveal it as clothing. But then the joke is that underneath she has more real fur, which of course is not real fur.”Other baffling elements are also discussed by Hooper, who credited Wilson with the idea of having the mice her character enslaves and terrorises played by children. He then adds: “Women playing cockroaches – whose only unusual trait is that they have an extra pair of arms, in homage to the cockroach number of limbs.”Wilson appeared on stage at this year’s Oscars alongside her Cats co-star James Corden to present the award for best visual effects. In their introduction, the pair referenced the poor reviews the film – and its effects in particular – had attracted.The following day, the pair and the telecast’s producers were criticised by the VFX Society, saying “the best visual effects in the world will not compensate for a story told badly.”In his commentary, Hooper praises the “great acting” of the duo, in particular Corden’s apparent break of the fourth wall in an alley-set scene. “I love the idea that James is sort of stepping out of the film for a moment to acknowledge the kind of natural tension between their claim that they were cats and the kind of hybrid design.”Hooper credits other actors with grace notes in the movie, including one unscripted look exchanged by Judi Dench’s Old Deuteronomy and Ian McKellen’s Gus the theatre cat, which indicates the pair were once lovers. Dench and McKellen, said Hooper, “decided their cats had some sort of romantic backstory”.Hooper, 47, has not yet announced his next project, but his commentary does give some insight into his current activities. “I must admit I’ve actually tried bowing down to a cat and saying ‘Oh cat’ just in the slight hope that it might unleash the cat to talk to me,” he says. “It hasn’t yet worked, but I will continue trying.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/163ef9661785d5a1034b2a10d2da63b4640f2720/0_602_8023_4815/master/8023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=215a2a1993890bad2d22fffc8e3686f7","title":"rachel roddy italian recipes for lockdown certainty in uncertain times","story":"Tins, packets and short ingredient lists are good friends right now – as is ever-resourceful Italian cooking.

With news of what was happening in the north of Italy ringing in our ears, we were told to stay at home, leave the house as little as possible and to do so only for essential shopping.That night, I looked in my cupboards and freezer and made a list of recipes. While words like “resourceful” and “ingenious” spun through my head, the recipes that formed from the packets of pasta, bags of peas and lentils, tins of tomatoes and oily peppers, chickpeas and chickpea flour, the lonely carrot, and the frozen chicken, were some of the things I like to cook and eat most, the recipes I have so enjoyed writing about here.The other day, standing by the wall outside a local shop, I realised it was my neighbour behind the pale blue mask two metres in front of me. We talked about lunch and it turned out we were both making minestrone, then chicken for supper: certain recipes for uncertain times, she said. I can’t put it better than that. Not only a great recipe that we make every week, but a great principle: almost all vegetables, if cooked in this way – until soft and saucy – form a pasta sauce.Four jars, a tin and a packet. Again, an idea as much as a recipe, one that can be shaped according to the ingredients you have in your fridge and cupboard – and how much you like each of them.A Roman classic, and not just for midnight after an evening out.I make a variation of this dish at least once a week, trying to make enough so the next day there are leftovers that can be mixed with short pasta.I have come to feel about bags of chickpea flour the way I once did about packets of cigarettes: one on the go, one spare at all times. There are endless ways you could top these pancakes.The chicken is browned and then simmered until tender with white wine and a great handful of finely chopped rosemary, chilli and garlic, and the dish finished with a spoonful of vinegar and some olives.Another great favourite and principle – making a thick soup and cooking pasta in it – that can be applied to almost all pulses.The magic of pasta-cooking water is revealed in this favourite recipe. I am not calling it carbonara or even carbonara-like – but the idea is the same, the egg and parmesan mixture meeting the sautéed courgette and pasta, along with the starchy water, to make a sauce.How to bring out the best in cabbage: slice it, cook it gently in plenty of fat with salt for a long time to serve with sausages."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2197aaf2ae6aa59a8ce444cf7c7f31181b703514/0_43_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96901adbe084cea51a050c4667717334","title":"premier league players wage deferrals coronavirus","story":"Premier League footballers are likely to accept wage deferrals as clubs look to ward off financial problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic.With all football in England suspended until 30 April at the earliest Premier League clubs are worried about their income drying up and are set to hold talks on Friday with the Professional Footballers’ Association about pay.

After the Los Angelenos met on a film set in 1999, they became fast friends, performing the stand-by-me act for one another through years of mutual failed attempts at finding lasting love.As dyed-in-the-wool Gen Xers, Clymer, 48, and Pablos, 47, share an obsession with classic 80s cinema. So naturally the say-anything bosom buddies finally up-shifted to full romcom hyperdrive after they pulled into a drive-in showing of The Goonies in 2015.“Don’t forget the ketchup for the waffle fries,” Clymer admonished Pablos from the car as he fetched the snacks.The way he looked back at her, she recalls, “It was like the Princess Bride moment.”As you wish, he replied – with his puppy-dog gaze.To paraphrase Meg Ryan: and then they fell in love.In April 2019, they got engaged, setting their LA wedding for 20 June 2020.And then the coronavirus pandemic hit.As a fast-increasing number of cities and states, Los Angeles and California among them, have imposed progressively stringent restrictions on gatherings in an attempt to flatten the curve of new Covid-19 cases, Clymer and Pablos have joined the legions of couples with spring and early-summer wedding dates who in recent weeks have seen their big day’s plans upended by the swift and devastating onset of the coronavirus pandemic.The couple has nevertheless maintained a Goonies-never-say-die outlook. They emailed their 250 invited guests on Friday to say they had postponed their wedding indefinitely, but weren’t heartbroken, “because this party does not mark the beginning of our commitment to each other, it celebrates the commitment that we have already made”.The best man’s father called to thank Clymer and Pablos for not compelling him to choose between possibly jeopardizing his health by attending the wedding and not supporting the couple.Pablos was brought to tears.According to the wedding planning and registry resource The Knot, the United States has 450,000 weddings slated for March through May alone.The Knot has launched a coronavirus hotline with its partner brand WeddingWire, and reports that many engaged couples calling in for guidance have said they’re downsizing to a small gathering at their parents’ house, or getting legally married in the short-term and planning a vow renewal ceremony on their first wedding anniversary.For the $78bn US wedding industry as a whole, the coronavirus-driven death knell came on 15 March when the CDC advised against gatherings of 50 people or more for the subsequent eight weeks.The chaotic fallout has included a mad scramble to postpone upcoming wedding dates, which in turn has fostered intense competition to secure the fast-dwindling slots available for late summer and fall bookings in particular.Such relatively near-term rescheduling is predicated on what may prove to have been magical thinking, given the current uncertainty of the US epidemic: that society will ultimately return to a significant shade of normal within the next three or four months.Pablos and Clymer, for their part, are already accustomed to virus-induced delays. Early last year, a flu she suffered stymied his cinematic vision for popping the question during a scheduled trip to Colorado that would have afforded a jaunt to a gorgeous snow-filled valley. So the film-maker scouted a new exterior location in New Mexico, near his parents’ home in El Paso – the site of their next trip. This provided his ultimate, successful proposal with a sandy backdrop, plus snow-dusted mountains in the distance.The cinephiles remain determined to marry at their original venue, the Motion Picture \u0026amp Television Fund retirement community for showbiz vets in Woodland Hills, California. Clymer works there and wants all the retirees she’s bonded with to attend her reception in their own backyard. (The actress Connie Sawyer, who appeared in the relationship-recap vignette that opens When Harry Met Sally and who died at 105 in 2018, was a dear friend.) For now, such a gathering is impossible given the need to protect seniors in particular from coronavirus.The near-instant loss or postponement of an entire busy season of weddings is proving disastrous for the 1.2 million people and the nearly 400,000 business that owe at least part of their incomes to the industry of matrimony. Everyone from wedding planners and caterers to florists and furniture rental companies have been blindsided.“The pandemic could change the industry,” says Olivier Cheng, president of Olivier Cheng Catering \u0026amp Events in New York City, a metropolitan area that has emerged this week as an epicenter of the global pandemic, with 17,853 testing positive for coronavirus and 199 people dying of Covid-19 as of Wednesday morning. “Our business model may need to evolve to survive.”With the overall events industry also crushed by the sweeping loss of corporate and non-profit jobs, the economic damage has only reverberated outward into other sectors.“We as an industry employ more Broadway actors than Broadway,” says Carla Ruben, president of the New York City and Miami–based catering company Creative Edge Parties. The company has already rescheduled 20 weddings through July – the lion’s share of their annual take.Cheng reports that during peak-season times, he will sign a two-week payroll amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars – money that he knows goes to support the artistic ambitions and families of hundreds of workers.“One of the reasons that I’m so proud of my business is I give people a livelihood,” Cheng says. As his payroll has plummeted to below $10,000 for the foreseeable future, he reports suffering a father’s heartbreak from not being able to provide for his sprawling family of workers.“On the bright side,” Ruben says, “There are still people getting engaged right now because they’re all stuck in their homes together and they’re realizing they’re with the people they want to be with.”Matt Kunkel, 24, and Emma Gassett, 25, know the feeling well. The two New York City theater industry professionals have delayed their Long Island wedding, originally slated for the end of the month, to July. In the meantime, they’re cooped up in their snug Manhattan one-bedroom.“The biggest test of a marriage is surviving quarantine together,” Kunkel says. “But there’s no one better to go through all this with than your best friend and the love of your life.”Interviews with dozens of engaged couples and industry pros suggest that by and large, flexibility is the new name of the game for wedding venues and vendors when it comes to rescheduling dates. As best as they can manage financially, they’re inclined to observe a sense of goodwill in the face of a universal crisis and overlook contract clauses – known as force majeures – that would normally impose a financial penalty on couples for postponements.Small businesses that depend on referrals would also like to avoid possibly besmirching their reputation by charging already distressed clients for altering their wedding plans given the extraordinary circumstances.Newlyweds Amber Matlock, 30, and Teyanna Noren, 26, of Tacoma, Washington, benefited from such generosity after the original venue for their planned 100-person wedding was forced to cancel on them with just eight days’ notice due to the state’s new restrictions on crowd sizes.“I started bawling my eyes out,” Matlock says.Fortunately, the couple was swiftly able to find a new, gorgeously bucolic spot for their scaled-down vows: an indoor-outdoor venue called The Five2Five in the rural town of Buckley, which is nestled at the foothills of Mount Rainier about 30 miles south-east of Seattle.“I started tearing up several times when we were at the venue,” Noren recalls, “because it was like, ‘We have hope again.’”The original reception site, Lake Wilderness Lodge, refunded the couple in full. And despite the fact that their reservation at The Five2Five came at a higher price point, the new company allowed them to pay no more than they had originally.Matlock and Noren’s wedding planner, Bianca Mattingly, helped secure agreements from the venue, caterer, DJ and photographer to work a short elopement ceremony plus a first dance last weekend, with a promise to return for a full-fledged wedding celebration at the same site in a year’s time. None have charged extra.In keeping with her industry’s guiding ethos, Mattingly is a fierce advocate for keeping romance alive – now more than ever.“People are scared, they need some hope,” she says.Further bolstering Matlock and Noren’s spirits, the typically curmudgeonly Pacific north-west weather gods blessed them with an atypically warm and cloud-free day last Friday, allowing the joyous brides to wed within a mid-afternoon glow.The 25 guests – just close friends and family – were each spaced six feet apart. There was lots of hand sanitizer and plenty of tissues to go around.As for Clymer and Pablos, after 21 years of friendship, waiting one more year to marry is no sweat for them. Because when they realized they wanted to spend the rest of their lives with one another, they realized that the rest of their lives had already begun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51e9871f92321546e0364325ade19312b1aecc64/1_0_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37b9171cc7218075b6a6e712581ef9e9","title":"zip it kim kardashian taylor swift britney spears","story":"It’s true the singer isn’t everyone’s favourite, but the online pasting she’s been subjected to leaves a very nasty taste in the mouthIn a way I’m glad that Kim Kardashian has reignited a four-year-old feud with Taylor Swift based on an 11-year-old feud with Taylor Swift that was all started by Kanye West, a man who has hardly been involved in it since about 2017. In a way, that’s good.On the other hand, come on. To help you catch up, this all truly started at the VMAs in 2009, when Swift was 20 and Kardashian was three years away from even dating Kanye, in fact was still at the “Carl’s Jr advert and a guest appearance at WrestleMania” level of fame. In 2016, Kanye released the song Famous, featuring the eternally controversial lyric: “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex  Why? I made that bitch famous.” Swift rightly took exception to having her career as one of the most successful singer-songwriters in global history getting reduced down to “that bitch”.At which point Kardashian – now an ascendent, royalty-level celebrity, married in a palace – released a Snapchat video of Kanye on the phone to Swift before the song was even recorded, openly discussing the lyrical content. The intimation was: Swift knew about the lyric, she fully had the heads up, she can’t be mad at being called “that bitch” in one of the biggest songs of 2016, and by being in any way upset at being called “that bitch” she is somehow Playing The Game. This is the natural starting point of our feud.I have gone through some changing feelings about Swift over the years, because I don’t really like her music – which is a fine and normal opinion to have. But something about the hugeness of Swift, and her ubiquity, makes “not really liking the sounds she makes” become something close to political. Here’s a rough Marmite analogy for you. Swift is the semi-popular yeast spread Marmite, in that if you love her, you love her with an intensity that blocks out the sun if you don’t, she leaves you utterly cold. But because her songs constantly loop on the A-list of society, you cannot escape Marmite, and now you’re starting to really get rubbed up the wrong way by Marmite.Every Friday afternoon, all the people in the office take control of the shared kitchen and make you eat a slice of bread and Marmite. At every wedding you are at, there is a tangible point in the evening when everyone, fuzzy drunk and joyful, kicks their shoes off and loudly heaps an entire spoon of Marmite into your mouth. Every time you tell someone you don’t like Marmite, they bore on at you for ages about how much umami her new album adds to stews and bologneses. At this point, you cannot avoid Marmite, because every advert is for Marmite and every time Marmite releases a new jar, every headline is about Marmite, and how Marmite “did that”. Despite not even liking Marmite, you somehow know about Marmite’s thing with Tom Hiddleston where he wore that vest.And now your feelings about Marmite aren’t about Marmite any more. They are fixed towards the celebratory Marmite culture that has been built around it, one you are constantly on the outside of, looking in. Anyway, this week the full and explicit 25-minute video of Kanye’s call to Taylor in 2016 got leaked. It went a fair way to vindicating Swift and making it clear she was unprepared to be called “that bitch” in the song. And Swift reacted to the leak by posting on Instagram: “Instead of answering those who are asking how I feel about the video footage that leaked, proving that I was telling the truth the whole time about *that call* (you know, the one that was illegally recorded, that somebody edited and manipulated in order to frame me and put me, my family, and fans through hell for 4 years) … SWIPE up to see what really matters.” And she added a link to various charity organisations supporting those on low income in the whole global pandemic thing. Kardashian responded by going on a Twitter rant.It’s actually quite fascinating how badly Kardashian has played this one, because normally the dynasty is so good at upselling bad news in a way that just makes them richer and more adored. In the past few years they have managed to turn secret pregnancies, cheating scandals, Kanye’s personal debt and the Kendall Jenner Pepsi advert into major PR wins. Each time, Kardashian somehow comes out of each one more regal and elegant and more on the cover of Vogue. But her feud with Swift has been a bum note from the off. What is it that Swift has been doing wrong, again? Being slightly too earnest in a hard-edged industry that clomps her around like a pair of shoes in a tumble dryer? Being gracefully tight-lipped in the face of years of provocation? Linking to a charity organisation on Instagram? Not liking being called a bitch? At this point, whatever your feelings about Marmite, it’s really hard not to take its side in the face of relentless attempts by Nutella to reignite a feud with it.A word on Comrade Britney, now, to whose revolution I offer humbly my hands and heart. While Kim Kardashian has been holed up in a Calabasas mansion going on about arguments that happened an entire World Cup cycle ago, Britney Spears has been a sunbeam of support to her fans throughout this pandemic, offering aid to those who are struggling and reaching out to her via DM. And, in really quite an unexpected zig, she has amplified an artist’s call for a general strike and a redistribution of wealth in the US. All right, Britney, let’s … all right man. Let’s do this. Drag them out by their hair.Personally, I’m a little unsure how much of that Britney actually meant. Over the course of her long career, she has only touched on politics once or twice, endorsing the Iraq war, being registered in Louisiana as a Republican (in 2001) and, in 2017, encouraging her followers to support the Dream Act, which would have offered legal status to undocumented immigrants who went to school in the US. So, “a mixed bag”. But then, in a nice font and on an orange background, and talking so charmingly about reaching out to friends and family … it does sort of look like a generically wholesome Instagram quote, if you squint and look at it.Like … you really have to read down to see the bit about taking the wealth and striking hard. I still back her pivot to communism to the hilt. And who among us hasn’t accidentally called for a revolution by sharing a meme they liked on Instagram? If she comes out of this with a Vegas show that calls for us to bring society crumbling down and rebuild it again from the rubble up, cool. And if she doesn’t? That is also OK. Stay safe, Britney Spears. Stay golden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51f42b656f9d4e85f529e5b4076c147f9429a0ca/0_0_4007_2405/master/4007.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7bbccf02a82e1406d79493d3956fa28","title":"meghan to narrate disney documentary in first role since royal split","story":"Elephant will launch on Disney+ days after Sussexes step back from being senior royalsThe Duchess of Sussex is to narrate a Disney film which documents the journey of a family of elephants across the Kalahari desert in southern Africa, which will launch three days after she and Prince Harry “step back” from being senior royals.Meghan will voice the Disneynature documentary Elephant, which will be available on Disney+ from 3 April, and is her first major acting role since becoming a royal.A trailer explains that the film will follow “one family’s extraordinary 1,000-mile journey across Africa on an adventure that will change their lives”.At the London premiere of Disney’s remake of The Lion King in summer 2019, Prince Harry was overheard speaking with the former Disney CEO Bob Iger about the idea of his wife doing voiceovers.

The first is a processing one – they are not all set up for staff to work from home. The big processing centres are closed and they are operating with a skeleton staff.“There is also the issue with valuations. A lot of the big lenders will accept desktop valuations but only to a certain loan-to-value. As they can’t get a valuer out to inspect the property, it is very difficult to process a mortgage application for a higher LTV.”Mortgage brokers said Halifax’s decision to halt much of its lending is the most serious since the credit crunch.Other lenders are likely to follow Halifax. HSBC said: “There are no current plans to change our mortgage lending approach at this stage, though clearly we will have to monitor service levels in these unprecedented times.”A spokesperson for Nationwide said: “We continue to support the market within the constraints of the current environment. We do not plan to pull our mortgage products at this time, but certain applications may take longer to progress.”Part of the reason for Halifax’s decision is that its staff are dealing with an unprecedented flood of requests for mortgage holidays.Harris added: “Lenders are throwing all their resources into dealing with payment holiday requests. In the same way that people are buying food they don’t need, people are asking for payment holidays when they don’t need them. That is blocking the line for those who do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06884a87c0ec9b418953ee2c2d9bccf5759efdda/52_30_1820_1093/master/1820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=356d8b891d2ab69df9d9a2825ee0531d","title":"la passione review grisey barbara hannigan","story":"Barbara HanniganLudwig Orchestra(Alpha)Hannigan conducts and sings Gérard Grisey’s final prescient work with style, conceiving it as a triptych with works by Handel and Luigi NonoFinding contemporary works to programme alongside Gérard Grisey’s Quatre Chants pour Franchir le Seuil (Four Songs for Crossing the Threshold) is an almost impossible task. This song cycle for soprano and ensemble, Grisey’s final work, first performed in 1999 just a few months after his sudden death at the age of 52, stands as one of the finest achievements of the last half-century. It’s an awfully prescient meditation on death and the process of dying, which might have signalled the beginning of a new, more openly lyrical phase in Grisey’s development, had he lived to explore it. Its mingling of loss and consolation is still very hard to separate from the memories of its premiere.On Barbara Hannigan’s recording with the Ludwig Orchestra, she pairs Quatre Chants with a Haydn symphony, No 49 in F minor, which gives its nickname, La Passione, to the entire disc. Hannigan’s performance of the Grisey (which she conducts as well as sings) is cooler, perhaps less immediate than the other version available on disc, with Catherine Dubosc and Klangforum Wien, but it evokes the work’s haunting, unclassifiably expressive world more vividly than ever.How the disc all fits together, though, is more problematic. Describing the programme as a triptych, Hannigan prefaces Haydn’s opening Adagio with Djamila Boupacha, the soaring central movement for unaccompanied soprano of Luigi Nono’s Canti di Vita e d’Amore, and then in the symphony encourages the continuo player to “stumble and fumble in the darkness, on a different path from the strings”. But in what is otherwise a conventional modern instrument Haydn performance, the effect of the anarchic harpsichord is distracting in the end it’s the account of Grisey’s masterpiece that provides the enduring experience here.There are no obvious connections between the three pieces on the latest release from NMC, all taken from concerts at the Wigmore Hall, and few stylistic links between their composers either. Anna Meredith’s Tripotage Miniatures, played by the Aurora Orchestra, are attractive essays in Meredith’s own peppy brand of minimalism, while Alexander Goehr’s tenuously tonal After “The Waking” reworks a setting for two baritones of a Theodore Roethke poem as a sequence of movements for a quintet of wind and strings (the Nash Ensemble). Most recent and lingering of all are Colin Matthews’s Three Postludes, dedicated to the memory of Oliver Knussen. The scoring, for oboe quartet and another quartet of strings, obliquely references Knussen’s own Cantata for oboe quartet, but the prevailing mood is less elegiac than angry even the suave beauty of Nicholas Daniel’s oboe playing (with the Britten Sinfonia) can’t disguise that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9dbd2dad138d2efc92deb00f90096898cb32d8f/0_479_4100_2461/master/4100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96da78cf0af6ac9ddd6d50cb9fd46e3c","title":"how far do the governments new emergency powers go podcast","story":"A new government bill that brings sweeping new powers to shut down mass gatherings, potentially detain people with coronavirus symptoms and weaken the social care safety net is being rushed through parliament. ’s Peter Walker explains what is at stakeA government bill being fast-tracked through parliament will bring with it sweeping new powers to restrict public gatherings and even detain people who show symptoms of coronavirus.

The Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith said this would stop any “interference” in the process. A set of boundary plans were voted down by opposition MPs in 2013.There has been criticism in the past that MPs have vested interests in the boundaries of their constituency, as any redrawing of the map can place into their patch new council wards that might typically vote for other parties, making the constituency more or less safe for their own party.In her written statement to the Commons, Smith said: “This change would provide certainty that the recommendations of the independent boundary commissions – developed through a robust and impartial process that is open to extensive consultation – would then be implemented without interference.”The government has now changed the rules so that the new map would be implemented automatically by bringing it to parliament through a mechanism called an order in council.The latest boundary review process, the sixth one to take place since the 1940s, recommended in 2011 that the number of MPs should be reduced from 650 to 600, but the process has been beset with delays. Proposals laid out in 2013 that were backed by the Tories were defeated in parliament.The Boundary Commission released new proposals in 2018 recommending scrapping 32 seats in England, six in Scotland, 11 in Wales and one in Northern Ireland.The boundaries would have scrapped Jeremy Corbyn’s Islington North seat and made Boris Johnson’s Uxbridge less safe by bringing in typically Labour-voting wards in Ealing.A controversial “Devonwall” seat that crossed the counties of Devon and Cornwall was another unpopular proposal in the now-axed 2018 plan.Smith said the decision to abandon plans to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 was sensible in light of changed circumstances.“Since that policy was established in the coalition agreement, the United Kingdom has now left the European Union,” she said. “The UK parliament will have a greater workload now we are taking back control and regaining our political and economic independence. It is therefore sensible for the number of parliamentary constituencies to remain at 650.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e647101750f5eda77ffa3fc89603177ec5a7f961/1_0_2546_1527/master/2546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d944649af5e89756a498a126f22ede3c","title":"gold the ultimate safety asset or a shiny relic of the past","story":"At times of uncertainty, people view gold as a low-risk, reliable store of value. We take a closer look at the well-known investment safe havenGold is the original precious metal. It is rich in symbolism but it’s also rich in function. Over millennia, it has been used for coins, jewellery, ornamentation, medals, electronic components, the basis of monetary systems and the titles of countless James Bond films. But, recently, people have been reminded of its historic use as a comparatively safe store of value.The bank was explaining why it still kept gold reserves. But during these times of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, its words sparked media discussions about investors buying up gold in a flight to financial safety.Unlike cash, the value of gold isn’t eroded by inflation. It is highly fungible and can easily be converted into hard currency wherever you are in the world. In extreme cases, such as in war-torn countries, if you lose everything else, you can carry a couple of small gold bars out with you. It also has a great heritage and global branding given that people have historically relied on it during times of political turmoil. “For thousands of years gold has been a store of value,” says Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, the online consumer investing platform.In recent months, the value of gold has increased amid concerns about the global economy and the spectre of a full-scale trade war between the US and China. The price of gold hit £1,278 an ounce last September as large numbers of investors bought into the precious metal during something of a rush to so-called “safe-haven” assets. These are lower-risk assets that are expected to retain their value or even grow in value when other assets fall – thereby helping investors to limit their exposure to losses. “You want assets that perform when the stock market doesn’t,” says Lowcock.Other safe-haven investments include defensive stocks that are less vulnerable to economic downturns, such as utility companies, supermarkets and other businesses that provide everyday essentials. Likewise, bonds usually offer more predictable returns than shares, and certain currencies such as the Yen and Swiss Franc are also seen as safe-haven investments.But while gold arguably remains the best-known financial safe haven, its safety as an investment largely depends on what you’re looking for.One of gold’s chief disadvantages as an investment is that it doesn’t provide you with an income. It pays no interest or idends, unlike shares or cash on deposit. The only money you make on gold is capital appreciation when the price goes up. However, in an economic environment where interest rates are very low (and bond yields are also very low), a lack of income from gold may not be that much of an issue.A bigger problem perhaps is that gold prices can and do fluctuate – and often considerably. In Davos, in 2010, George Soros famously said: “When interest rates are low we have conditions for asset bubbles to develop, and they are developing at the moment. The ultimate asset bubble is gold.”It’s also worth remembering that all safe-haven investments have potential downsides. Indeed, the only safe haven that can’t lose you money is cash – although it can lose you value in high inflation environments and it generally provides a poor return in low inflation environments such as the one we’re currently in.Of course, economic fundamentals aside, centuries of symbolism mean that gold’s emotional and psychological value is unlikely to fade any time soon. And as our faith in our financial system is continually tested, perhaps it will one day come to symbolise the important value of safety as much as wealth.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

Alexi Duggins explains why playing it safe is a smarter step Has there ever been a more underrated word in the English language than “safe”? For something that is fundamentally a good thing, people can be weirdly dismissive about it. Eyes are rolled at workplace health and safety as though it’s somehow uncool to not lose a hand to poorly maintained machinery. Romcoms lazily wield it as an unflattering cliche: “Oh, I don’t know. My award-winning humanitarian of a partner is perfect in every conceivable way – but they’re just so … safe, you know?”Meanwhile, there’s no bigger cliche than being edgy just for the sake of trend-chasing. Over the past two decades, the fad for extreme sports has reached (and plummeted from) ever-crazier heights. Our fetishisation of high-risk, high-wire living has even spread to dining, with foodies flocking to increasingly ridiculous eateries simply because they look cool on social media. How many times have our friends told us they tried out a Hot New Place that wasn’t actually very good – while we pity their gullibility and coo soothing words such as: “Oh what a shame that insect-based menu wasn’t actually that delicious.”Spurred on by the peer pressure of social media and clickbait articles about patently daft new trends, people all too often act as if they’re playing a gigantic game of chicken. When they aren’t posting smiling holiday selfies from the post-nuclear wreckage of Chernobyl, they’re braving the latest Insta grooming trends that you just have to try – even if they leave you looking like you’ve had your eyebrows rubber stamped on to your face.The 21st century seems so unhinged, it feels as though it’s drastically in need of a friend to confiscate its phone and force-feed it a sensible mug of Horlicks. So as we enter a new decade, it’s time to wake up to the obvious truth that sometimes playing it safe might be the smarter option. Sure, it won’t necessarily make for great social media content or keep trend forecasters in business, but the tried and tested route at least offers proven enjoyment.But there are things out there that are just unfailingly brilliant – melted cheese, beaten-track holidays, every Bill Murray film ever made. These are just some of the reasons that “safe” should be something we embrace. Another is the obvious fact that safety keeps you, well, safe. Just consider all the revolutionary advances in car safety technology.The safe option is one that doesn’t lead to you royally screwing up. It’s a guaranteed good time. It’s not being afraid to use your critical faculties, shun desperate fads and to do something that you genuinely know to be great. It’s suiting yourself, no matter the pressure to do the same stuff that everyone else is talking about.It isn’t always easy. But increasingly, playing it safe is the boldest thing you can do.We’re under so much pressure to be edgy these days that we often overlook safer, more rewarding options. Here are some user-friendly safety tips to help you navigate modern lifeBinge-watching TVWe might be living through an extended golden age of television, but the explosion in edgy programming has also given us an awful lot of duds. So it can be all too easy to make a habit out of wasting 12 hours of your life. Protect yourself from another bad long-term relationship with a TV show by learning when to quit. Studios like to make a big splash on their opening, so if the first episode sucks, it isn’t going to get better from there on in. But what happens when you’re, say, four episodes in? One way to develop the discipline to quickly give up is to think of your time as an economic investment. Just because you’ve invested four hours, it makes no sense to invest more if there’s no likely payoff. Economists call this the “sunk cost fallacy”. Instead, focus on the future time you’ll gain rather than on the time you’ve already sunk.The beaten trackIt’s easy to have that once-in-a-lifetime holiday: go somewhere you’ll never, ever want to visit again. Plenty of people willingly do this in the name of adventure or to prove their alpha credentials. But there is much to be said for the relaxing and restorative joy of the safe, well-trodden path – such as comfortable beds, rainproof roofs and nice food. The trick to taking your first step back to the beaten track is to refrain from judging other people for choosing the tourist trail and package holidays – then hopefully you’ll stop judging yourself.Foodie warningSocial media and TV cookery shows have conspired to make food even more of a feast for our eyes than our taste buds. But trying to assess food’s deliciousness with your eyes is like trying to appreciate music with your mouth. It’s important to take food-based Instagram posts with a pinch of (figurative) salt, as some restaurants try to capitalise on these trends by creating dishes based around how they’ll look on social media. Avoid regrets by engaging in real conversation: if you see friends posting about having eaten somewhere that looks great, get in touch to check they actually rated the taste of the meal. Just because someone shares a pretty photo, it doesn’t make it a food recommendation.Before you startup, stopThe digital revolution has fuelled such a fixation with startups that it almost feels de rigueur to quit your job and start your own venture. Alternatively, you might be tempted to devote yourself full-time to your side hustle. Before you consider whether or not to take the plunge, one question you should ask yourself is whether the thing that you’re really fetishising is the idea of being a risk-taker rather than the venture itself. So be sure to scrutinise your real motivations. For instance, are you following your passion or your ego? And bear in mind that sometimes our egos are actually fuelled by feelings of insecurity.Savvy tech is safe techEach month brings a cacophony of new digital bells and whistles and it can be easy to simply dismiss them. So how do you sift useful tech from pointless tech? One tip is to ask whether or not the new app, gadget or feature will save you time, give you pleasure or make you safer. The latter question often gets overlooked. But when it comes to developments such as smart homes and in-car technology – including driver monitoring and assistance systems – making things safer is actually the main point.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

But now archaeologists have excavated a cave on the coast of Portugal and discovered a huge, structured deposit of remains, including from mussels and limpets, dating to between 106,000 and 86,000 years ago.Researchers say the discovery shows that Neanderthals systematically collected seafood: in some layers the density of shells was as high as 370kg per cubic metre. They say this is exciting because the use of marine resources on such a scale and in such a way had previously been thought to be a trait of anatomically modern humans.Prof João Zilhão, of the University of Barcelona, a co-author of the report, said the discovery added to a growing body of research suggesting modern humans and Neanderthals were very similar.“I feel myself uncomfortable with the comparison between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, because the bottom line is Neanderthals were Homo sapiens too,” he said. “Not only was there extensive interbreeding, and such interbreeding was the norm and not the exception, but also in every single aspect of cognition and behaviour for which we have archaeological evidence, Neanderthals pass the sapiens test with outstanding marks.”The findings chime with recent evidence that Neanderthals had “surfers’ ear” and may have ed to collect shells for use as tools. Previous finds in Spain have shown they decorated seashells and were producing rock art 65,000 years ago.“Forget about this Hollywood-like image of the Neanderthal as this half-naked primitive that roamed the steppe tundra of northern Europe hunting for mammoths and other megafauna with poor and inefficient weapons,” said Zilhão. “The real Neanderthal is the Neanderthal who is in southern Europe.”The discovery appears to throws cold water on the idea that the marine-rich diet of modern humans, high in fatty acids, helped them to outcompete Neanderthals as a result of better cognition.Writing in the journal Science, researchers reveal how the newly excavated site, which was about 2km or less from the coast when occupied by Neanderthals, contained a plethora of stone tools, roasted plant matter and remains from horses and deer, as well as from eels, sharks, seals, crabs and waterfowl, suggesting a erse diet.Zilhão said the find also shed some light on Neanderthal fishing practices, noting that they must have had baskets or bags. “You cannot walk 2,000m with a catch of 10 or 20 kilos of shells in your hands,” he said, adding that the Neanderthal population also probably understood that shellfish collected at the wrong time could be toxic.The team say the dearth of other huge shell deposits in Europe could be down to a lack of preservation: shellfish could not be transported far from the coast, and hence many such deposits in northern Europe would have been destroyed as polar ice caps advanced, while elsewhere they may have been submerged as the sea rose to today’s levels.The stretch of Portuguese coast where the new find was made is perhaps the only location locally where such deposits could have been preserved, they say. South Africa, by contrast, experienced an uplift of the land, meaning many such deposits have been preserved.Dr Matthew Pope, a Neanderthal researcher at the UCL Institute of Archaeology who was not involved in the study, said its findings were significant.“We have increasingly recognised the sophistication of Neanderthal behaviour, but one thing that continued to mark out the behavioural evolution of modern humans in Africa was the appearance of systematic collection of marine resources, and this marked a difference between the two populations,” he said. “Evidence like this is important in showing Neanderthal populations had the capability for systematic exploitation of marine resources.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1ec8cd8746ab9a519cfc82d90d3d4ee0341a71b/0_0_1866_1120/master/1866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7605da8d95f7aeb14532f911c96923bf","title":"fossil of 67m year old raptor dinosaur found in new mexico","story":"Remains of agile meat-eater show raptors were thriving right up to point asteroid struck 66m years agoA meat-eating dinosaur with a feathered body, iron grip and a tail for agile pursuit of prey, has been discovered by fossil hunters, revealing that raptor dinosaurs were thriving right up to the point the asteroid struck, 66m years ago.The remains, comprising about 20 bones, were found in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, in rocks dating to about 67m years ago. They are believed to be from a type of dromaeosaurid – a family of theropod dinosaurs that includes raptors – which appears to have been a close cousin of the velociraptor.Dubbed Dineobellator notohesperus – a nod to the indigenous people of the region, the Navajo, the latin word for warrior and the south-western US location it was found in – the animal would have been about two metres in length, weighed about 18-22kg, and been covered in feathers.The animal’s claws also showed large projections on their bottom side, where muscles and tendons would have attached. “They are especially large, which would have given this animal a really strong grip and ability to grasp things with both its hands and feet,” said Jasinski. And while many dromaeosaurids had stiff, reinforced tails that acted as a counterbalance, helping the animals run fast while low to the ground, the newly discovered beast had an extra feature: mobility.“The one major thing that is different about Dineobellator is that at the base of the tail, the vertebrae are set up differently so it makes the tail highly mobile at the base,” said Jasinski. That, he added, means the dinosaur would have been able to whip its stiff tail around while pursing zig-zagging prey, meaning it was not only a nippy predator, but agile to boot. While the final moments of Dineobellator are lost to time, the team found a gouge in one of the animal’s claws that appears to have been made around the time of its death – suggesting the beast may have met a sticky end. “We speculate an altercation with another Dineobellator or other predatory theropod resulted in these marks,” they write.Jasinksi noted that while dromaeosaurids were present in both Asia and North America about 125m years ago, there are few fossils from the period that followed, with more recent remains discovered primarily in Asia.“It looks like the ancestors of Dineobellator would have basically migrated from Asia and then ersified once they got back to North America at the very end of the Cretaceous, right before they went extinct,” said Jasinski.Jasinski said the findings emphasised there was still considerable ersity before the mass extinction, despite some arguing that dinosaurs were in decline. “It shows dromeosaurids were still basically evolving, they were still trying out new evolutionary pathways, new features, up to the very end,” he said.Dr Stephen Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the research, agreed, adding that Dineobellator is the best fossil raptor dinosaur from southern North America during the very end of the age of dinosaurs, and one of the last surviving raptors.“In fact, it seems like there were many types of raptors in North America at this time, so they were really prospering,” he said.The creature would have been fearsome, he added. “If you saw it alive, Dineobellator would have looked like a weird, long-tailed, toothy bird – but one that could chase you down on foot and gut you with its claws.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03fc03369bc1c6b41b9053c66abdc48b8bfc4861/2_158_1117_670/master/1117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec969cf0a6442b8cf1391992c2447f72","title":"chess candidates stopped after russia suspends air traffic","story":"The world championship Candidates in Ekaterinburg was abruptly stopped on Thursday morning, with seven of 14 rounds played, after the Russian government announced that international air traffic would be suspended from Friday. Fide, the global chess body, planned a charter flight to Amsterdam enabling the Chinese, Dutch, French, and US grandmasters plus their aides and tournament officials to leave before the deadline.Fide’s intention is to complete the tournament later this year, still in Russia and with points already scored counting, so that its winner, the official challenger for Magnus Carlsen’s crown, can play the Norwegian in Dubai in December. Whether coronavirus will permit this schedule remains to be seen.The Candidates had been the only global sports event to continue under the threat of the virus. The eight GMs had daily medical checks, and the games were played behind closed doors. They could still be watched online, and with no competition from other sports chess sites reported a surge in viewers.Seven of the 14 rounds have been completed, and these scores will stand when it becomes possible to resume the postponed tournament. Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (France) and Ian Nepomniachtchi (Russia) led with 4.57, ahead of Fabiano Caruana (US), Anish Giri (Netherlands), Alexander Grischuk (Russia) and Wang Hao (China) all 3.57, Kirill Alekseenko (Russia) and Ding Liren (China) 2.57.Vachier-Lagrave was a late substitute after Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan withdrew, but the Frenchman played well and scored a significant win over Nepomniachtchi in the seventh round,especially as head-to-head is the first criterion in a tie-break situation.The Winawer French 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 Nc3 Bb4 is rare nowadays in top-class tournaments, but Vachier-Lagrave was ready for it as his opponent had already used it earlier in the tournament and might be tempted to use the French Defence against a Frenchman.Seventy years ago the French was the staple weapon for Mikhail Botvinnik in his title matches against Vassily Smyslov,and the patriarch also used it against lesser lights, even against myself at Hastings 1961-62. Most present day grandmasters distrust the French as too passive, and reasons for this emerged in the game. White’s AlphaZero-inspired advance of Harry the h pawn was met by an ugly defensive front of Kf8Rg8, while Black’s central lock c5-c4 was mistimed.White took advantage by opening up the f file and infiltrating via the strong 35 Qa1!Ding and Caruana were the pre-tournament favourites, but China’s No 1 is too far behind to recover. The weeks of lockdown in his home city of Wenzhou followed by two weeks quarantine in Moscow took their psychological toll. Ding lost three games, contrasting with the 2018 Candidates where he was unbeaten and his record, later surpassed by Carlsen, of 100 elite games unbeatenCaruana was also subdued despite appearing with a full repertoire of planned opening surprises. The world No 2 so is still only one point behind the leaders, and has the favourable white pieces against Vachier-Lagrave in round eight.

Yet some people have dealt with the restrictions with impressive creativity.The freestyle skier Andri Ragettli normally spends his time flying over slopes in Switzerland, but this week he has turned his flat into an assault course to work on his technique and balance. Ben Zwiehoff, a cross-country mountain bike racer, has also turned his accommodation into a training centre. Elisha Nochomovitz, a restaurant worker who has to stay at home due to the lockdown in France, popped outside to his balcony to complete a marathon. Nochomovitz was meant to be competing at the Barcelona marathon this month, but had to settle for 3,000 laps of his seven-metre balcony instead.Footballers have been keeping shape at home too. Manchester United player Angel Gomes has been practising his shooting by lobbing balls into his bin. Trent Alexander-Arnold has also been keeping his eye in. Although, instead of picking out Andy Robertson on the opposite flank at Anfield, he has been pinging balls at his garden furniture. Sergio Ramos has been on his running machine (with his top off, naturally). David Silva incorporated his kids into his workout regime. Bruno Alves has been doing keep-ups with his chest. And Alexis Sánchez has been walking his dogs and putting pictures of them on the internet in a time of great upheaval it is comforting to know that some things never change.The footballer responsible for the most creative training regime has not been a professional but a young goalkeeper called Nathan. The youngster, who is isolating in Ireland, has come up with a drill that does not require any other players. He kicks a ball against his garden wall and then rushes across his goalmouth to make a save before the ball can rebound off the wall and into his net. Juan Mata, the Manchester United midfielder, was so impressed by Nathan that he offered to have a training session together once lockdown restrictions are lifted.How are you keeping fit and active during lockdown?

Reports on Thursday suggested that a deadline of 1 May seems likely for a decision on the Tour, because it will be clear by then whether the outbreak has peaked in France, and because that would give a clear two months for cyclists to prepare for the race. A representative of ASO contacted by the  said the company had no comment to make.“There needs to be a Tour de France. After that, it is the state of public health which will determine how viable that is,” said the Groupama-FDJ manager, Marc Madiot. Madiot’s team leader Thibaut Pinot, whose parents are both involved in the fight against the virus, told the website cyclingnews that, “the question is not whether the Tour de France can take place at any cost or not. My concern lies mainly in the fact that if we cancel the Tour de France, it would mean that the pandemic has not stopped.”From Belgium, Patrick Lefevere, the head of the sport’s most successful team, Deceuninck-Quickstep, was dismissive, saying: “I’m an optimist, but I don’t see how they can justify running the Tour de France. What about the fans? Who can enter France and who can’t? Are we really going to stuff the hotels with people? I can’t imagine someone waving a magic wand in early July and the coronavirus crisis suddenly being resolved.”“As long as public health can be guaranteed,” the head of the Sunweb team, Iwan Spekenbrink, told the Le Monde newspaper, “I can see this being the race that restarts the cycling season, even if it will have to be guaranteed that everyone has a minimum amount of time to train for it.”ASO and the French sports ministry worked together to ensure that the first major stage race of the year, Paris-Nice, went ahead in early March in an atmosphere of tension as European nations began to close their borders and impose lockdowns as the crisis deepened. Spectators were not permitted at the race starts and finishes, or on major climbs, and the daily ritual of riders signing on was abandoned.Certain teams decided not to start, and others withdraw during the race amidst concerns for the health of their riders and staff, and on the logistics of getting riders and staff back to their homes. The race ended a day early to avoid a finish in the centre of Nice.Mărăcineau told a French radio station on Wednesday that the Tour might be feasible in a restricted form because it does not rely on ticket sales but on television rights for the bulk of its income. “Everything is imaginable,” she said. “Everyone knows the reasons and the benefits that it can bring to all. So finally it wouldn’t be so bad because you could still watch it on TV.”She added that she was well aware that the Tour was the principal showcase for cycling team sponsors, and that the survival of professional cycling itself might be at stake. “Cancelling the Tour would be a real problem, even if it was for only a year. But for the moment it’s too early to take a decision.”As the biggest ticketless sports event in the world, the Tour draws between 10 and 12 million spectators to its roadsides during the season, prompting obvious questions about the practicality of running the race “behind closed doors”, although many of those spectators come from outside France and might be deterred by closed borders. But at least the 2020 Tour itself does not cross any of those frontiers, as it takes place entirely within France after its start on 27 June in Nice.The Tour calls upon 29,000 members of French security forces during its 22 days, with at least one gendarme on every road junction along the route and access restrictions have at times been imposed on some major climbs to avoid overcrowding. Recently, amidst fears of terrorism, security measures at the event have been massively increased.If the Tour were to go ahead, it would not be the first time that the French state has ensured this. In 1968, immediately after the country had been through a period of public disorder and protest, the Tour organiers were considering cancelling the race but were told by the government that they wanted it to go ahead to underline that normal life was still going on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb65c4f19a0c84bd1cffc23d67e1c8840143d51b/426_49_3880_2328/master/3880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f6b7817ccc581820d44877e95bb5284","title":"frankie johnny and terrence audra mcdonald mcnally","story":"The revered US playwright, who died earlier this week, is remembered as a kind, wickedly funny friend by the actor who starred in three of his playsThere is a musicality to all three of the Terrence McNally shows I did on Broadway: Master Class concerns the great a Maria Callas Ragtime, of course, is about a style of music and in Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune, each of the characters is moved, without really understanding why, by the Debussy piece that changes the temperature of the room.Terrence wrote Frankie and Johnny just after getting sober and as he was turning 50.

Frankie is a wonderful character. She is so closed off and damaged, she has PTSD as a victim of domestic violence, and she protects herself with her sense of humour and by remaining alone.

They kick off on 2 April with a play regarded as one of the most joyously laugh-out-loud shows of the last decade.One Man, Two Guvnors, directed by Nicholas Hytner, is Bean’s 2011 adaptation of Carlo Goldoni’s 1746 comedy and a brilliant vehicle for Corden’s stage comedy skills. ’s Michael Billington, giving it five stars, wrote: “The result, a kind of Carry On Carlo, is one of the funniest productions in the National’s history.”That will be followed by Sally Cookson’s adaptation of Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre, a production  that began at Bristol Old Vic Bryony Lavery’s adaptation of Treasure Island which was the National’s Christmas show in 2014, and the 2017 Twelfth Night, which starred Tamsin Greig as Malvolio. More titles are still to be announced.The shows will also have accompanying contact, which includes Q\u0026ampAs with casts and creatives and post-show talks.The National is just one of many arts organisations quickly endeavouring to get content out to the public during the coronavirus lockdown.The RSC has teamed up with the BBC for six plays to be broadcast from their archives including the 2016 Hamlet starring Paapa Essiedu the 2018 Macbeth that  starred Christopher Eccleston and Niamh Cusack, and the 2015 Othello, which starred Hugh Quarshie and Lucian Msamati.The Royal Opera House has made available productions that  include the Royal Opera’s Così fan tutte and the Royal Ballet’s Peter and the Wolf.Burger said storytelling was needed more than ever. “That combination of entertaining, inspiring, challenging … it makes us think a bit about what other people might be going through. But also it just brings people together around something which is shared. I hope it stimulates a lot of conversations.”As well as National Theatre at Home, the theatre is making its online resource for schools, universities and libraries, the National Theatre Collection, accessible at home while everything is closed.The National Theatre will be one of many arts organisations and iniduals to benefit from Arts Council England’s £160m emergency package to help them survive the coronavirus crisis. The money is also designed to help them come up with creative responses “to buoy the public” during the lockdownBurger said it was a positive move. “Of course it is very much needed because we are all in a very precarious position. It is good that they have got that money and we look forward to understanding how it will be used, how freelancers can be supported and also theatres who don’t receive Arts Council funding.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9418346ad148194debc2feda856c31dc780b5ca/0_0_4969_2982/master/4969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d77ba96e5c542e918d338a9c13777fbd","title":"can i get a cash refund instead of a credit note coronavirus travel questions answered","story":"Among the hundreds of questions we have received, one reader expressed concern over accepting a credit note. Plus we answer questions on future tripsHelen’s other concern was that the credit note may be worthless if the company goes out of business. This week the Association of Travel Agents (Abta) has confirmed that credit notes will have the same protection as holidays. It says: “If you are not able to postpone, your travel provider may offer you a Refund Credit Note instead of an immediate cash refund. This Refund Credit Note can be used to book another holiday at a later date and, in the meantime, it is protected by AbtaAtol – if your original booking had that protection. So, you would be reimbursed if the travel company failed financially.”Abta is also advising anyone with trips booked for later in the year to be patient. As the Foreign Office advice against all but essential travel is currently only in place until mid-April, it warned that customers “may incur cancellation charges or lose a deposit if you make a hasty decision”.• For further information and advice go to Abta’s websitePeter Brady from Aylesbury booked and paid in full for flights with British Airways to Italy from 24 May returning 31 May. He said after filling in the form with British Airways to receive a voucher and rebook for another time, he has received an email from British Airways saying that he is not eligible for a Future Travel Voucher. He wants to know why.Unfortunately, airlines will only offer refunds while the Foreign Office is advising against all but essential travel or while flights are suspended due to closed borders.Kim, 60, from Warrington asks whether she should pay the full amount of her holiday by 20 April for a trip due to depart on 2 July. She says “I am unsure where I stand if I cancel until next year. Would I incur costs?”A similar question was covered in last week’s Q\u0026ampA but as so many readers have asked it’s worth reiterating: tour operators are trying to be as flexible as they can while facing drastic loss of business, so it’s always worth asking your travel provider – if you can get through to them. But, legally, refunds or credit notes only apply to holidays that have been cancelled due to Foreign Office advice or where the tour operator itself has suspended trips (for example Intrepid, above, suspended tours until 31 May). Any holidays after that comes under normal terms and conditions. The best advice is to wait and see whether travel restrictionsbans are extended so that they affect your holiday. If your holiday is cancelled then you will be entitled to a refund.Two readers have asked about children wanting to return to university. Alex, in Wiltshire, said: “My daughter who is at university in Belfast flew home a week ago. She needs to go back to Belfast to move out of her university accommodation and bring her belongings home. Easyjet has cancelled all flights from Bristol. Do you think it would be irresponsible for her and me to drive up to Cairnryan in Dumfries and Galloway and take a ferry to Belfast? The ferries still seem to be running.”While the UK is on strict lockdown people should not travel anywhere other than for food or medicine or for a short walk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80c5719c3cc56634055764561f175d13723e4a9c/98_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25b4f7bcba4ee5e0f485fc3be06b43ac","title":"bbcs doctors 20 weird as ever","story":"The daytime soap that can out-weird David Lynch is the perfect medicine in these worrying timesDaytime television is a erse offering. Any given weekday morning could see you veer from the low-stakes thrills of property-profits show Homes Under the Hammer to a dose of Frasier repeats, then to Holly and Phil on the This Morning sofa and back for some antiquing with Bargain Hunt. Designed to appeal to people working from home as well as stay-at-home parents, sick kids and hungover students, its scattergun approach can make it one of the most strangely enlivening yet comforting sections of the TV schedule – the perfect background scene to your day’s activities.For 18 months, when I was working from home as a freelance, I would eat my breakfast in front of the TV, usually opting for a dose of Homes Under the Hammer or Frasier, then get dressed and get to work. Alternatively, I would stay where I was, melting into the sofa, unable to find the remote as the entirety of This Morning (all 150 minutes of it) gave way to Loose Women and – on particularly unfruitful days – Jeremy Kyle. Those days stretched the definition of “work”.Yet there was one daytime staple that would forever lurk in the periphery, a bizarrely reassuring presence that celebrates its 20th anniversary this week: Doctors. Set in the fictional West Midlands town of Letherbridge, its daily 28-minute episodes unpick the middling dramas of a local GP surgery and its surprisingly wacky cast of characters.While Doctors may sound like a sanitised Holby City or House, it operates in a far more obscure and – dare I say it – avant-garde space. On the surface, each episode contains one medical predicament that is usually neatly resolved, while affairs and longstanding resentments bubble throughout the weeks. The seasoning, though, is sprinkled liberally in the form of a two-pronged attack: truly absurd plot scenarios and acting that is so wooden it almost seems as if the whole show is a running joke at the viewers’ expense.Take a recent genius episode in which a patient, Lizzie, suffered from a condition that made her see every white man she encountered (and some white women with short hair) as Joe Pasquale. That’s right, early 00s variety show comedian Joe Pasquale – who gamely appeared in the episode, as if to prove his enduring existence. You would think such a severe break from mental acuity would prompt some sort of panic. But no, this is Doctors, so Pasquale is used as a running gag and Lizzie is ultimately carted off for “neurological testing”. We never see her again. David Lynch would never be so brave as to attempt a Pasquale in one of his dream sequences.In another episode, a man entered the surgery to have a vasectomy, only to find out – on the suspiciously unsterilised surgical table – that his partner had been cheating on him all along, that the child he thought was his was the product of a Mallorcan one-night stand and that he should retain his vas deferens after all. He found this out because his partner was watching him have the surgery (in the same room!) and stepped in at the last minute to deliver another Doctors mannequin monologue.It may seem surprising that the drama has clung on for so long – having borne no notable acting talent – but its fans are a committed bunch, taking to social media to vent their outrage when it has been placed on summer hiatus in favour of the football and ensuring its steady survival in the ratings. Even now, as production has halted owing to the coronavirus, there have been numerous Facebook messages of support to cast and crew.These fans are on to something in their avid loyalty, since the drama in Doctors is so inconsequential that it makes for perfect background viewing during the coronavirus lockdown. It is a familiar hum of conversation to tune out while you work, just as you would at the office, or a woozy fever dream to accompany your own lethargy.Now that most of the UK population will have the chance to watch the show in real time, tuning in at 1.45pm in a post-lunch haze after their 15th consecutive meal of pasta and toilet paper to absorb whichever new medical drama and C-list celebrity cameo comes to light. Home workers of Britain, unite and take solace in half-ignoring storylines while aimlessly scrolling through your emails! Doctors is the perfect quarantine TV. Long may it continue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb8d4ba2730e614ff27cd79cbc2fd2d4011ad6f7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cfc8a1158b418dea9adff106e27dd75","title":"comfort viewing our favourite shows to rewatch in lockdown","story":"From Tony Soprano’s ever-expanding waistline to Buffy’s student army, 10 writers tell us the TV they are most likely to rewatch – and whyWe all have that one show we turn to when we have scrolled through all of Netflix and found nothing else, when we need a brief window of distraction from life’s stresses, or if we want a nostalgic reminder of another, simpler time.Now, in lockdown and with bags of time on our hands, it seems like the perfect moment to revisit those box sets and indulge in hours of rewatching, away from the ever-present tyranny of choice.We asked 10 writers to take us through their rewatches of choice, from the gripping drama (and culinary delights) of The Sopranos, to the fast-paced political intrigue of The West Wing, the romantic trials of New Girl and Gossip Girl, as well as the niche fascinations of Law and Order: SVU. Or, if you would rather not live in the TV screen of the past, one writer argues to stick with the endless stream of the new.If the past is a foreign country, rewatching The Sopranos is like stepping into another universe entirely. The silken polo shirts and rattling gold bracelets, the flip-phones and leather-seated Sedans, the strippers and – above all – the sandwiches David Chase’s late-90s epic on mobsters reckoning with their consciences is endlessly rewatchable. So much so that I am about to embark on my third viewing of the six-season, 86-episode odyssey of James Gandolfini’s masterful Tony Soprano and the enduring chaos of his New Jersey family of mafiosos. While I might dip in and out of Friends for a comfort-rewatch, or turn to Bob’s Burgers for an easy laugh, it is almost impossible to watch single episodes of The Sopranos it is too granular and endlessly gripping. A tentative look back at a pivotal scene soon finds you four hours in, forgetting what happens next.And there are myriad narratives to follow: the evolution of Anthony Junior from chubby-cheeked tween to emotionally devastated young adult Meadow’s journey from daddy’s girl to fierce independence Uncle Junior’s entire aesthetic Livia’s decrepitude and Carmella’s relationship rollercoaster, from loyalty to defiance to begrudging acceptance. Of course, holding it all together are the fantastic performances by Gandolfini – whose weight gain over the seasons starts to make his heavy breathing its own marker of dramatic foreboding – and Lorraine Bracco who plays his increasingly conflicted therapist Jennifer Melfi. Their therapy sessions are a masterclass in zippy dialogue and unspoken emotion, as close as we can get to riveting conversation in this time of social isolation.The show ultimately manages to strike that ineffable balance between escapism and emotional realism, lending it endless depth and rewatch potential. If nothing else, the food is worthy of a repeat view: pepper-stuffed sandwiches, cannelloni, heart-busting ice-cream sundaes mouth-watering culinary inspiration for your quarantine. Ammar KaliaEvery few months, I like to imagine the decimal point of my bank account has shifted a few spots to the right and hang out with the hyper-privileged teens of New York City’s Upper East Side. The Gossip Girl world is so spectacularly removed from mine – even were I not self-isolating – that watching it gives me the same rush I imagine sci-fi fans get from films about sentient spaceships and alien incubators. The show follows a group of beautiful, obscenely wealthy teenagers living in palatial penthouses and the “poor” family that enters their orbit ah yes, so poor are the Humphreys that they are confined to a loft in Brooklyn. Their lives are so thrillingly interesting that an anonymous blogger, Gossip Girl, follows their every move by posting pap shots and salacious rumours. The plots sit somewhere between tabloid and high art: in one story arc, an 18-year-old billionaire trades his girlfriend for a hotel in another, an incest storyline isn’t even close to the weirdest thing in that series.Although things happen almost constantly, nothing ever really changes, which makes it perfect for unending rewatches. The script is overflowing with mixed metaphors and one character’s entire personality is that they love to cook waffles. It should be terrible. It should be consigned to the forgotten annals of Netflix for ever. And yet, it is amazing. The melodrama of your teens magnified by about one million percent and sprinkled with limitless money? Who wouldn’t want to watch that over and over again? Kate SolomonI have had the phrase: “Gave me cookie, got you cookie” swirling on a loop in my head for three days. Buried among every terrible coronavirus-related pun I have come up with to distract myself from the most bizarre and eerie global situation in my lifetime, is the grouchy voice of New Girl’s Nick Miller delivering this line. Startlingly, it has become a sort of meditative balm. Inhale … gave me cookie exhale … got you cookie.To say New Girl is my favourite show would be an understatement. I mark my life through New Girl rewatches and sometimes I lay in bed and genuinely wonder if Nick, the recalcitrant bartender turned YA author with questionable hygiene habits (I would definitely have got the ’Rona from him) is my ideal man. The seven-season sitcom starring Zooey Deschanel as the titular character has its axis in friendship. Zooey’s sweet, quirky Jess becomes a room-mate to three men with wildly different personalities (douchey Schmidt, grumpy Nick, unexplainable weirdo Winston), and along with her feisty best friend Cece, becomes enmeshed in ridiculous hijinks with them as they meld into a highly dysfunctional and incestuous family.The show is funny without losing its heart and sweet without becoming cloying. It has all the intimate tenderness of a dear friend roasting you before pulling you into a hug. I started watching New Girl while depressed in my final year in university and, eight years later, it remains a show I watch when I need laughter to alleviate the darkness of the world to remind myself of joy and where it lies: within our connections.In season two, episode five, Schmidt buys Nick a cookie. He saw it and thought of him. The emotionally reticent Nick is uncomfortable with the display of tenderness and, throughout the episode, agonises over how to reciprocate. Eventually he settles on returning the favour, verbalising his affection the only way he knows how: like a Neanderthal. “Gave me cookie, got you cookie. You gave me cookie, got you cookie! Gave me cookie, got you cookie, man!” In my language that means: “I love you and I’m here for you” and I think that’s beautiful. New Girl remains a reminder that hope and joy finds a home in love and its expression. Bolu BabalolaFrom the moment that cheesy theme tune kicks in, I feel at home. Perhaps it is because I mainlined the series while suffering from extreme exam-related anxiety at university, but The West Wing will always be my happy place. Its depiction of late-90s Clintonian politics may seem increasingly dated, yet in the creation of a group of well-meaning, if flawed, politicos, Aaron Sorkin solidified for many the way politics should be done.From Rob Lowe’s puppyish Sam Seaborn, to the gruff but ultimately warm-hearted Toby Ziegler (a pitch-perfect role for Richard Schiff), every West Winger has something about them to love (except Mandy nobody liked Mandy she was swiftly disappeared at the end of season one). Watching Alison Janney’s bizarre performance of the Jackal never fails to bring a smile to my face – and there is a simple joy to those first four seasons of Sorkin dialogue at its best. The walk-and-talks are the stuff of legend, and the rapid-fire, flirty banter between Josh Lyman and his secretary Donna (this was of course pre-#MeToo) are reminiscent of the best black-and-white screwball comedies.There is even a quarantine lockdown episode – No Exit, in season five – but perhaps that’s too close to home just now. Instead, I can revel in that opening episode as the word “Potus” rings around my head, or Martin Sheen’s Latin excoriation of God in the season two finale, Two Cathedrals. I might be stuck inside, and Donald Trump might be terrorising the White House out there, but I can always depend on President Bartlet. Toby MosesComfort television suggests something warm and swaddling, but one of my go-to watches when I need a shot-in-the-arm is the extended, penultimate episode of the final series of The Thick of It. It is an episode that mirrored and coincided with the real-life Leveson inquiry and its themes, but also brings to mind Chilcot.Laughing obviously makes one feel better and The Thick of It is hilarious, but it is not just that. Seeing intelligence, creative competence, incredible art – if that does not sound too pretentious – is also immensely cheering. Whether it is the brilliant lines we came to expect – “I’m just a lad from Leeds with a lust for life” “If you make eye contact with Malcolm Tucker, you have spilled his pint” “He was only homeless in the sense that he didn’t have a home” – seeing the regulars at the very top of their game, or the sublimely handled mix of tone, it is an hour of perfect television.Some insist that the early New Labour focus of TTOI was superior, but this episode does not merely induce pleasure in its one liners but in its depth and resolve the quiet, oblivious truth-telling by the much put-upon Robyn, and the exquisite Peter Capaldi with his Rachel Dolezal-esque facial expression when everything comes crashing down. But his final bravura speech is arrow-accurate by the writers. These days it is hard not to shove one’s fist into one’s mouth every time someone on Twitter grabs a clip of modern-day politics and makes the same joke: “Missed this episode of The Thick of It!!!!” But even that cannot stop the boost this hour gives me. Hannah Jane ParkinsonI very, very rarely rewatch drama at least not without a very big gap in between. Comedy, however, I can and do watch and rewatch, virtually on a loop. It might be Silicon Valley, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Cheers, and for most of the 90s it was of course Friends (when it was not Will \u0026amp Grace) but most often these days it is Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Tina Fey’s first post-30 Rock venture and arguably her masterwork.It has everything that normally makes rewatching a comedy worthwhile, turned up to 11. The jokes are not just plentiful but fast and might be pulled from any genre at any moment. Daft puns, slapstick, callbacks, character jokes, topical gags, broadbrush generic or tiny little things that depend on a Spelunker-level knowledge of the nichest of niche pop-culture references. And then there’s all of Tituss.The inidual and ensemble playing is endlessly watchable, awe-inspiring and prompts an urge to dissect it, even as such a project will and should for ever elude you. Had you world enough (and time) could you ever teach anyone else to hit the beats like Jane Krakowski does so perfectly and seemingly effortlessly? And finally there is the sheer oddity of the thing. From the premise – 30-year-old woman emerges into the world after 15 years held in a bunker by her kidnapper the Rev Richard Wayne Gary Wayne – to the collection of eclectic characters. But it does, harnessing a series of idiosyncrasies to a singular, ridiculous vision and going all in on it. Utter mastery. Utter joy. Lucy ManganYou know you have watched a lot of Law \u0026amp Order: Special Victims Unit when you can recite the opening narration (“In the criminal justice system, sexually based offences are considered especially heinous …”) with the same ease as an NYPD cop reading a perp his rights. And there is a lot of SVU to watch. There have been 21 seasons and nearly 500 episodes since 1999, when Law \u0026amp Order franchise supremo Dick Wolf first debuted this particularly moreish combo of police procedural and courtroom drama. The choicest rewatch cuts, however, are found between season two – when Munch (Homicide: Life on the Street transfer, Richard Belzer) was partnered with Tutuola (Ice-T) – and the season 12 departure of the lead detective, Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni).Dogged devotion to TV formula is what Law \u0026amp Order does best, but those “ripped from the headlines” plots also keep things fresh over repeated viewings, while squad room chats on issues such as consent and gender identity provide fascinating snapshots of changing social attitudes. Like the man says, these offences are “especially heinous”, but there is something both cathartic and comforting about watching Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and her team put away all manner of unsavoury iniduals.The abundance of available reruns also makes it enjoyably easy to forget which you have seen and which you have not. Do I instinctively know that the friendly-seeming schoolteacher is lying about his whereabouts because I half-remember how this one ends? Or has Law \u0026amp Order: SVU transformed me into a damn fine detective at last? Ellen E JonesIf you really put your mind to it, you can get through Spaced in a single day, horsing through its two short seasons on DVD or All 4 in under seven hours. (“Skip to the end!” as Simon Pegg’s rudderless skater-boi Tim might put it.) At various times in the two decades since it debuted, that is exactly what I have done, hunkering down with Jaffa Cakes and other indulgent supplies for a concentrated blast of heightened daftness. Each time, it still manages to feel fresh.Has any other sitcom arrived so fully formed from the outset? With their slacker tale of slapdash flat-sharing – a relatable milieu of sloppy hoodies, Rizlas and PlayStation – writers and stars Jessica Hynes (then Stevenson) and Pegg produced writing as deft and dense as The Simpsons. Their cleverly nested verbal gags and unparalleled physical mugging were further enhanced by the director Edgar Wright’s lickety-split aesthetic: a reaction shot unexpectedly framed through a girl power V-sign still triggers a giggling fit.And even after you have parsed the cascade of pop-culture references, catalogued each cameo by future Britcom luminaries and fully internalised the David HolmesColdcutPrefab Sprout soundtrack, what you are left with is the sheer pleasure of hanging out with characters who feel like real people, with all the shared in-jokes and tolerated failings that signal true friendship. It used to be a nostalgic portal back to my time-wasting 20s. Now Spaced’s chaotic tale of found-family solidarity offers genuine solace. Graeme VirtueFor someone who watches a lot of television (back off, it’s my job), I find it hard to rewatch many shows. There is so much that is new and worthy of our attention that going back to old, familiar ground often feels like a waste of time. There are a couple of exceptions, however, the greatest of which is Buffy, which has taken on a therapeutic role in my life.Many, many years ago, after a breakup, I measured the duration of my sadness by how long it took me to rewatch all seven seasons in their entirety. By the time Buffy was over, so was the heartbreak. Now, I dip in and out of my favourite episodes, but some – Hush, The Wish, The Body, Once More With Feeling, Who Are You? and Restless, to be precise – are frequently revisited. The sound of the theme music alone is the equivalent of a hot bath in mood lighting.There is something particularly soothing about its ultimate moral simplicity. People are flawed (and flayed), they make mistakes, and they learn how to be better. Buffy is the Chosen One, and she has to face her toughest challenges alone, but the biggest, most world-threatening villains require collective action. They need a whole graduation class’s worth of students to destroy a big snakey mayor, the support of one’s friends to combat a secret military base filled with monsters, a whole army of new slayers to battle the First. Now, more than ever, that feels like a message to take comfort from, from the comfort of indoors. Rebecca NicholsonRewatching TV shows, especially at a time of massive global crisis, sounds like a genuinely lovely idea that will doubtless bring a warm feeling of comfort and joy to many people’s lives. Except, I won’t be one of them. The thought of a repeat viewing with shows I love and which have serious rewatch potential – Arrested Development or The Office – fills me with dread. That is even true of rewatching a casual, noncommittal episode (something I only ever allow myself to do “for work”).But outside of that: absolutely not. Never. Ever. The feeling of shame, of drowning in 10,000 other, newer shows begins to set in within milliseconds. “Why haven’t you finished Cheer yet?” my brain says. What about Schitt’s Creek? Sure, you don’t know anyone who actually watches it and you have no idea what it’s about, but people are always talking about it on Twitter aren’t they? What about the new series of This Country, or Shrill, or literally anything else that you’ve not already seen? And that’s before you even get to the classics. What about Breaking Bad, that show you watched one series of and never thought about ever again? Maybe now’s the time to get really, really into that like everyone else did 10 years ago. Or Game of Thrones: that was a bit of a big deal, maybe you ought to finish that one?The whole thing is just another source of anxiety, to be honest, which is a shame because I would love to watch The Office Christmas specials guilt-free. Just once, ideally this summer, while all my other plans are off.

Walk down the road right now – well, not right now – and they know Motivator.”Motivator, real name Derrick Evans, praised Wicks’ success in reaching millions of viewers every day with his livestreamed YouTube workouts for schoolchildren. “It’s his time now, he’s great, he’s very different to me. I’m still doing what I do and I’m 67. Joe is coming from the children to the family I’m going from the older people to the family. I use music all the time Joe doesn’t use music. So we’re very different.”In recent years Motivator has increasingly focused on mental health issues and a more holistic approach to wellness, rather than the exaggerated personality known to viewers in the past. “I’m not prepared to just come on and jump around, that was just part of what I’m about. Television was interested in the entertainment side of me, not what was deep inside of me ... Physical fitness is only part of the pillars that hold up our wellbeing. Are you in love? Are you out of love? How are you going to cope with everything that life throws at you? It’s a bit deep but that’s where I’ve always been.”Motivator will be appearing to offer his tips on the newly commissioned HealthCheck UK Live, airing on weekdays at 10am on BBC One from Monday. The show is being launched to directly address the concerns of viewers who are in self-isolation, offering tips, especially to older viewers, on how to keep healthy and happy. It will be hosted by Michelle Ackerley and Dr Xand van Tulleken, along with Angela Rippon, who is currently self-isolating.In addition Motivator is launching a short daily livestreamed workout at midday every day, titled the Daily Dozen, on his Twitter and forthcoming YouTube channel.Motivator said his childhood in Jamaica experiencing extreme weather had shaped his approach to the lockdown. “You learn from a hurricane: you need your health, you need food in the fridge, and we need each other. Hurricanes have a really cleansing effect on us in the Caribbean – you wave to the neighbours and see if they’re all right. In this case we’re going to have to learn a different kind of language and some positive short-term things we can do to reduce stress levels. Even if it’s just putting a sign in the garden saying ‘do not disturb’ and going to the garden shed.”Asked for his advice for  readers who are self-isolating, Motivator said: “Every morning when you get up, you should do it with purpose: don’t keep your pyjamas on all day. Get dressed. Put your trainers on. Every hour my alarm clock goes off and reminds me to get up and do something.“Then there’s always music on in my home. Right now every one us should be dancing like there’s no tomorrow. So put that combination together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a62889d8e84ed1f44a195a5e2e2abe350737c70/0_31_2125_1275/master/2125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b308ac851bd916a8c9473d0a0ec7d3f","title":"lockdown tv which show would you like to rewatch with us","story":"As the coronavirus pandemic stops us from enjoying our favourites with our friends and family, come watch a classic from the BBC, ITV or Channel 4 with usLong gone are the days when the idiot box was seen as a solitary activity that rots your brain.

The coronavirus pandemic, including more than 2,600 confirmed Israeli cases, has added urgency to efforts to break a stalemate between the two leaders.“These are unusual times and they call for unusual decisions. That’s why I intend to explore the formation of a national emergency government,” Gantz told the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.While neither side confirmed that an agreement was already in place, suggested scenarios have included Gantz and Netanyahu taking turns as prime minister in a rotation system.Whatever the outcome, Gantz took a risk by nominating himself for speaker, and he was accused of blindsiding allies and supporters in the process.Throughout three elections, the former head of the army has run campaigns squarely focused on promises to oust Netanyahu, who faces criminal charges for alleged corruption.Before the vote, Gantz’s public plans were to elect a speaker from his party and push through legislation to end Netanyahu’s historic political career through term limits and bans on prime ministers serving while under indictment.That plan appears to have been abandoned by the opposition leader in favour of the complete opposite – he may now, as speaker, protect Netanyahu from such legislation to keep the possibility of a unity government alive.However, in doing so, Gantz’s Blue and White party looks on the brink of disintegration, with factions within it refusing to back his candidacy for speaker, and several moving to break away.Both the Yesh Atid and Telem parties, which hold more than half of Blue and White’s seats, filed to leave the alliance.Yair Lapid, Gantz’s running mate and the head of Yesh Atid, accused the leader of surrendering “without a fight”.“Benny Gantz decided today to break apart Blue and White and crawl into Netanyahu’s government,” he said at a press conference on Thursday evening. “We ran together because Benny Gantz looked me in the eye and said we would never sit in this bad government.”Tamar Zandberg, a member of the leftwing Meretz party allied with Blue and White, accused Gantz of abandoning millions of voters who sought an alternative to Netanyahu.“You’ll end up a rug under the feet of an alleged crook, an inciter and racist,” she said in a speech to the session. “We are overwhelmed by the depth of the deceit and disgrace that has plagued today.”In his speech, Gantz said he would “never compromise on the principles underpinning the votes of over a million Israelis who voted for Blue and White. I will never compromise on democracy. Netanyahu is well aware of that.”While a unity government was not confirmed, a member of Netanyahu’s rightwing bloc, the defence minister Naftali Bennett, publicly congratulated Gantz for what he said was “the brave step of entering into a unity government under Netanyahu”.Israel’s previous speaker, Yuli Edelstein, was a close ally of Netanyahu and a member of Likud. He resigned on Wednesday following fierce criticism of his refusal to open parliament, which he suspended last week citing a ban of large gatherings while the country tackled the coronavirus.The suspension was decried as an anti-democratic attempt to shield his job and to protect Netanyahu from bills that could oust him.For the past year Israel has been in a state of political paralysis as a result of three inconclusive elections, the latest of which was held on 2 March. In that time both Netanyahu and Gantz have been picked to form governments and failed. Throughout the crisis, Netanyahu has remained interim prime minister.Gantz was the latest to be tasked with forming a government after gathering a loose coalition of anti-Netanyahu Knesset members to back his candidacy. However, it was not clear if he had the votes to build a solid, majority coalition by the mid-April deadline.Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin, has been urging the two leaders to form a unity deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance mar 26","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide has passed the half a million mark, according to the latest figures on the Johns Hopkins University global dashboard. Cases stand at 510,108 and deaths at 22,993.The leaders of the powerful G20 countries have been urged to unite to find joint solutions to the coronavirus pandemic and “ignite a new global movement” to ensure it never happens again. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, told leaders: “You have come together to confront the defining health crisis of our time. We are at war with a virus that threatens to tear us apart – if we let it.” He urged them to “fight without excuses, without regrets”.G20 leaders, meeting in a virtual video conference call, have committed to do “whatever it takes” to minimise the social and economic damage of the pandemic. But a largely unspecific and uncontroversial joint communique set no specific commitments, such as deferring debt repayment for the world’s poorest countries, as sought by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The IMF’s request for G20 leaders to back a doubling of its emergency financing capacity was not addressed.Some 232,470 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 and 13,692 people have lost their lives across the European Economic Area and the UK, according to the latest data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.Boris Johnson has called on governments around the world to work together to create a vaccine as quickly as possible and make it available to anyone who needs it. Speaking after the virtual summit of G20 leaders, the British prime minister said the UK would donate £210m of aid funding to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is supporting the development of vaccines. The sum is the largest donation by any country.China has announced it will close its border to foreign nationals from this weekend. Other measures include restricting foreign airlines to a single route, with no more than one weekly flight. Each Chinese airline is permitted one route to any specific country with no more than one flight a week.A record 3.3 million people filed claims for unemployment benefits in the US last week as the Covid-19 pandemic shut down large parts of the country’s economy. According to the Department of Labour, the number of new jobless claims filed by iniduals seeking unemployment benefits rose by more than 3m to 3.28m, from 281,000 the previous week. A domestic power struggle, disputes over how best to tackle coronavirus and a split between US and European foreign policy have all combined to bring down the government in Kosovo, plunging the country into constitutional chaos. The government of the prime minister, Albin Kurti, lost a no-confidence vote brought by one of its own coalition partners late on Wednesday evening, by 82 votes to 32, with one abstention.In the Middle East, 184 new coronavirus cases were reported on Thursday in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Lebanon, Oman and Kuwait. The Saudi health ministry announced 112 new cases, pushing the total to 1,012. A third death was also reported. In Lebanon, health officials said 35 more patients had tested positive. There were 14 new cases in Bahrain, 10 in Oman, and 13 in Kuwait.Postal workers in Ireland have volunteered to check in on elderly and vulnerable people during their rounds, a potentially invaluable safeguard while such groups self-isolate. The employees suggested the idea to the Communications Workers’ Union, which took it to management and the government, who gladly accepted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6b1cd4fcd2e769a4476f5d58d820ff60f818ef/0_92_5625_3376/master/5625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98d8ae2d6ea3cae43996bad11b01c724","title":"coronavirus support package for uk self employed how does it work","story":"Britain’s 5 million self-employed workers earning less than £50,000 a year will be eligibleThe chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has unveiled an emergency support package to protect Britain’s 5 million self-employed workers. But how will it work in practice?The last three years’ tax returns will be the key evidence of your earnings on which an assessment will be made. HMRC will take an average of your last three years’ profits as a self-employed person. If you have been self-employed for just one or two years, then HMRC will rely on those tax returns only.It will not be an immediate payment – Sunak said the grant may not be awarded until June. But it will then be backdated to March, which suggests the maximum grant could be as high as £7,500. He added it was possible the scheme could be up and running before June, but did not want to promise anything earlier.The scheme is designed to last three months, but will be reviewed and could be extended.It is unlikely you are going to receive anything. The Treasury said anyone with trading profits above £50,000 would not be eligible. Your trading profit is broadly the same as your “taxable profit” that you entered in your tax return. Explaining the cut-off, the chancellor said the average income of those excluded from the scheme was about £200,000 a year.HMRC said to qualify for the scheme, at least one of these things must be true:Sunak said the government had made universal credit more generous and that a family could pick up as much as £1,800 a month in support. He added that the Department for Work and Pensions could make advance payments of the benefit, “certainly within days” of an application. Councils also had money to help families with council tax bills, he said.You don’t apply right now. HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs will administer the scheme and contact you with a form you will have to fill in and send back.The chancellor said the grant was taxable. So when it comes to your next tax return, the likelihood is that if you have returned to earning a decent sum, then some of the grant will be clawed back through the tax system.You will only receive the grant if you have previously put in a tax return to HMRC.You can, but move fast now. The chancellor said he will accept “late” tax returns for the next four weeks only.No. The chancellor said that it is only available to those people who make the majority of their earnings from self-employment.The Treasury said: “Those who pay themselves a salary and idends through their own company are not covered by the scheme but will be covered for their salary by the coronavirus job retention scheme if they are operating PAYE schemes.”The chancellor said he did not want a scheme where the perfect would be the enemy of the good. He said the existence of a prior tax return was a good way of making sure the person was genuinely self-employed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6d28c02e8de261960986f6c18350b58cfb7f854/0_0_4812_2886/master/4812.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=879fd6238a536d8fa289ebab728ada00","title":"coronavirus symptoms what are should i call a doctor uk","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the Covid-19 virus, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.As of 26 March, more than 500,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 23,000 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. Italy has been hardest hit, though, with over 8,200 fatalities. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 120,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

The UK left the EU on 31 January and has until the end of the year to negotiate a new economic and security relationship or face trading on WTO terms with large tariffs on goods.Despite Downing Street’s public insistence that a similarly comprehensive text would be tabled earlier this month, EU sources said the UK had tabled only four documents covering trade, transport, aviation and nuclear cooperation. London has not tabled legal text on significant issues including security cooperation or fisheries, and nor has it made its texts public.EU sources also said the UK’s positions in the texts were in a “different galaxy” to those of Brussels.“The first big difference is that we have a fully fledged proposal in line with the political declaration while the Brits have only tabled a few things, much less than we expected”, one senior EU diplomat said. “The scope is much narrower than we had thought it would have been and that makes it difficult to work with. That’s the basic problem.”Officials on both sides are also struggling to find a way to get negotiations going, with plans for talks in London and Brussels now abandoned given the Covid-19 crisis.UK officials said the legal text covering the outstanding areas would be produced at a time of the British government’s choosing, and attempts to find a new method of “continuous dialogue” were being made.EU sources said the position was desperate. “We can’t even move out of Brussels to our capitals to talk it through,” said one source. “Everything is in the deep freeze.”The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is in quarantine having been infected with the coronavirus. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, has been in isolation after showing symptoms.The two sides need to agree on whether or not to extend the transition period by “up to one or two years” before 1 July. Johnson has insisted the UK will leave the EU’s single market and customs union by the end of the year come what may.The former Brexit secretary David Davis has suggested in recent days that the coronavirus pandemic would limit the damage of failing to secure a deal because trade would already have been reduced to a minimum.The main sticking points between the UK and the EU remain on so-called level playing field commitments to ensure that both sides retain high standards in the fields of environmental, social and labour regulations. Brussels is seeking non-regression from EU standards and for the UK to “harmonise” with Brussels on state aid rules that limit subsidies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6a13864be4b89c1257560f3c5f4fc51730e7b2d/0_119_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d38d4126c70508cd63ac30cce22ab39","title":"covid 19 self test could allow return to work says public health england","story":"NHS England medical director tells MPs tests may be available within a couple of weeksSelf-testing at home to find out whether somebody has had Covid-19 is an efficient way to find out if they are safe to return to work, a senior health official has said.Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director of NHS England, told the health select committee that finger-prick home tests would be available very soon. “We expect that to come within a couple of weeks, but I wouldn’t want to promise on that,” she said.It was “critical to understand what is going on and allow people to return to work” she said. Self-testing was not new and was well understood by the public, with routine tests available such as the pregnancy test. “The intention is to allow people to do as much of this as they validly can. It is by far the most efficient way, if the technology will support it,” she said.On Wednesday Prof Sharon Peacock, from Public Health England, told MPs on the science and technology committee that a home test to detect antibodies indicating somebody has had Covid-19 was being evaluated this week in Oxford to make sure it worked as well as is claimed and would be available next week. Government advisers later cautioned that the test might not be ready so quickly.But the health ecretary, Matt Hancock, has said the government has bought 3.5m antibody tests and will buy more.Governments around the world are all seeking better and faster tests to show whether people have the disease or have had had it and recovered. Singapore developed an antibody test as early as February. The US Covid-19 co-ordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, has said the US government is interested in it, and private US companies are also developing antibody tests. They include California-based Biomerica, which is selling to Europe and the Middle East, and New York-based Chembio Diagnostics, which is selling to Brazil.“Some are developed now. We are looking at the ones in Singapore,” Birx said on Monday at a White House press briefing. “We are very quality-oriented. We don’t want false positives.”UK firms and academics have also developed self-test kits for Covid-19 that are expected to be available to buy in the coming weeks or months.One cheap test is made by Mologic, a diagnostic test firm based in Bedford. Another kit has been developed by researchers at three UK universities led by Brunel University.Mologic has produced the first prototypes of an antibody test for Covid-19, building on its experience of developing a rapid test kit for Ebola. Assessment and validation of the test began this week at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and St George’s, University of London.The company said it would take three to four months before the test is available in the UK and other countries. It will cost £1 in the UK and will be as simple to use as a home pregnancy test but will use saliva or blood rather than urine, with results ready in 10 minutes. Mologic, which received £1m from the UK government to develop the test, will be able to make 8m kits a year at facilities in the UK and Senegal. In Senegal it will be sold for less than $1.“These tests could be a game-changer for diagnosis and follow-up of patients both in hospital and in the community, allowing us to detect cases early and isolate patients and their families rapidly,” said Dr Emily Adams, a senior lecturer in diagnostics for infectious disease at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.The test kit developed by researchers at Brunel University London, Lancaster University and the University of Surrey is based on science evaluated in the Philippines to check chickens for viral infections. The battery-operated handheld device processes nasal or throat swabs that are inserted into it, and delivers the results within 30 to 45 minutes via a smartphone app. The team has approached UK, US and European regulators for approval and is in talks with 60 manufacturers. It could be available to the public within a few weeks.The device will be priced at £100 and can test six people at once. The test can detect the virus in iniduals who show no symptoms because it recognises the DNA structure of the virus in the samples."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46480048d99a2813227b446f31029ec9c24972ec/0_28_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=be9a7667b9001163b1e0fc55c607f827","title":"universal credit claims almost impossible as more than 500000 apply","story":"Only a fraction of applicants have been able to start claim online or get through to DWP on phoneWorkers attempting to apply for universal credit after being laid off during the coronavirus crisis have described how it is almost impossible to complete a claim.More than 500,000 people have applied for the vital payments in the last nine days, the Department for Work and Pensions revealed on Wednesday.However, benefits experts have warned that only a fraction of them will have succeeded because the service is swamped and it is currently almost impossible to talk to anyone at the DWP.First-time claimants have described calling the service between 80 and 100 times to no avail.  has been trying over the last two days, and has been unable to get through.

Many are also coming up against the problem that those with savings of more than £16,000 are not entitled to universal credit.Anna Stevenson, a welfare and benefits expert at the financial charity Turn2Us, said claimants had been contacting the charity to report the problem, fearful that this will hold up the payments they are due.She said the lack of call handlers is particularly affecting those applying for employment and support allowance, those with a disability or health condition, which rely on a phone call.“Universal credit claimants have to make this appointment within 30 days of them completing their applications, and for the claim to be approved, the interview must happen. People have been contacting is to us to ask what is going on as they are finding it impossible to get through,” she said.The DWP said on Thursday claimants could ask for an appointment by going back online and adding a note in their journal.On Wednesday the DWP’s top civil servant, Peter Schofield, told MPs that processing universal credit claims had become the department’s main focus.He said the department had so far redeployed 1,500 members of staff to help with universal credit claims, and the aim was to increase this to 3,900 by the end of the week.The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is due to give more details of support for the country’s 5 million self-employed people later today, which may halt the rise in claims.The work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, said: “The system is standing up to the challenge, but with a tenfold increase in claims it is inevitable that there are pressures on our services. We are taking urgent action to boost capacity, including moving 10,000 existing staff to work on new claims with 1,000 already in place, and will recruit a further 1,500 staff to aid the effort. I’m hugely grateful to all our staff who are working extremely hard in difficult circumstances to process claims at pace.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9e7e9e6cda00b566484b11c62b6b88f14f176d5/0_39_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b441ed9c1ffa3aa2871895f17e119d2e","title":"how ventilators work and why they are so important in saving people with coronavirus","story":"A shortage of ventilators will put lives at risk, so health authorities around the world are doing everything they can to get more Health authorities around the world are trying to find ways to fill their hospitals with more ventilators to cope with increasing numbers of coronavirus patients.Car manufacturers are offering to help build more of the machines. In New York, city mayor Bill de Blasio says he needs 15,000.Australian authorities say they are confident they can avoid any shortage of ventilators.Experts have told  Australia that these efforts will be crucial, because a shortage of ventilators would put lives at risk.“The reason this is a crisis is because without the ventilators, patients will die,” says Prof David Story, deputy director of the University of Melbourne’s Centre for Integrated Critical Care, and a staff anaesthetist at Austin Hospital.Prof Sarath Ranganathan, a board member of Lung Foundation Australia and director of respiratory and sleep medicine at Melbourne’s The Royal Children’s Hospital, said: “The experience in Italy and Spain, and the modelling used by mathematicians around the world, indicates the number of people who will become critically ill with Covid-19 will greatly exceed the capacity to care for them using respiratory support.“Without access to ventilators many patients who might survive the infection will die.”A mechanical ventilator is a machine that’s used to support patients with severe respiratory conditions that impact the lungs, including pneumonia.Before a patient is placed on a ventilator, Day says medical staff – often anaesthetists – will perform a procedure called intubation.After a patient is sedated and given a muscle relaxant, a tube is placed through the mouth and into the windpipe.Day says the procedure is routine but, with Covid-19 patients, medical staff need to take extreme precautions to make sure they do not become infected with the virus.“We have people almost in full hazmat suits,” he says.The breathing tube is then attached to the ventilator and medical staff can adjust the rate that it pushes the air and oxygen into the lungs, and adjust the oxygen mix.Before deciding to put a patient onto a ventilator, Story says doctors are looking for signs of “respiratory failure”.“The breathing rate will increase, they’ll look distressed, the CO2 in the blood goes up and they can become sedated and confused,” he says.He says while a normal breathing rate is about 15 breaths a minute, if the rate gets to about 28 times a minute, then this is a signal that ventilation may be needed.Before going on a mechanical ventilator, Prof John Wilson, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician, says there may be other attempts to increase a patient’s oxygen levels.These “non-invasive” methods of ventilation can include masks and oxygen tanks.Story says that with Covid-19, medical staff were looking to avoid non-invasive methods because patients would still cough and splutter, increasing the risk of the virus being transferred to medical staff.Ranganathan says once a doctor sees that a patient needs a ventilator, “it is required quickly”.He says: “The patient can be sustained for short periods of time using manual forms of ventilation such as using a bag and mask system with oxygen, but usually being attached to a ventilator needs to happen within 30 minutes if critical.”Story says that in severe Covid-19 patients, a life-threatening condition can develop called acute respiratory distress syndrome (Ards) that requires ventilators to deliver smaller volumes of oxygen and air, but at higher rates.This could mean a patient may need to be on a ventilator “for weeks”.To avoid complications from the breathing tube going down the throat, Story says a tracheostomy is carried out so the tube can go straight into the windpipe through the neck.“Patients can be more awake with tracheostomy and the hole just heals itself,” says Story.“If patients develop Ards they will be in an intensive care unit for weeks and they’ll die without ventilators.”One of the most obvious ways to avoid a shortage of ventilators, is to reduce the numbers of people catching the disease in the first place. That means following all the health advice, including social distancing and hygiene rules.In Australia, the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association, the Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society and the industry minister, Karen Andrews, have all expressed confidence that a shortage can be avoided.The Australian government is also investigating whether ventilators used on animals in veterinary clinics could be converted. Sleep apnoea machines and anaesthetic machines are also options.Story says ventilators used in ambulances could be used as back up.All of that work will be crucial in saving lives if the social distancing measures and community lockdowns don’t stem the flow of patients into critical care.Wilson said: “Health care workers responsible for managing severe life-threatening cases like Covid-19 are extremely concerned regarding their ability to use appropriate support for large numbers of patients expected to suffer respiratory failure.“In essence, this means that many will not be able to be treated with mechanical ventilation and difficult decisions will have to be made by staff, families and patients about the limits of support. There are many ethical dilemmas in this, and none can be easily resolved.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4213324.1585256939!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tcd provost says new students may end up starting college slightly later this year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Patrick Prendergast reassured secondary students hoping to study at Trinity that it will welcome new students in the autumn. Photograph: Tom Honan The provost of Trinity College Dublin has said new students may end up starting college “slightly later” this year on foot of disruption to education linked to the coronavirus pandemic.In a video message to students, Dr Patrick Prendergast reassured secondary students hoping to study at Trinity that it will welcome new students in the autumn.“ I can only imagine how difficult this situation is for you. At this time when you should be focusing on preparing for your exams, you find everything is uncertain and up in the air,” he said.“But let me reassure you, that come the autumn, we will be welcoming many of you to our campus. It might be slightly later than in previous years. It might be under slightly adjusted criteria.“But we will be welcoming you. Every autumn, the university renews itself through the influx of new students.“This autumn, more than any previous one, it will be a new beginning indeed. When this crisis is over, I look forward to embarking on that journey with you, together.”DeferredThe  reported this week that Leaving Cert students could end up sitting deferred exams and starting college as late as October or November under contingency plans being discussed by senior education sources.While official plans are to press ahead with the Leaving Cert in June as planned, the Department of Education has been engaging with a range of education stakeholders over alternative plans in the event that the exams do not begin in June as planned.While senior figures have emphasised that discussions are at an early stage, several sources have confirmed that the option of deferring exams until late summer and starting a new third level academic year in the autumn are being “seriously examined”.Some higher education institutions have signalled that they would be in a position to delay the start of a new academic year for first-year students by up to two months if necessary.In his video message, Dr Prendergast also confirmed that Trinity will take a “financial hit” from the coronavirus fallout across all its revenue streams and that extra costs will be incurred.“On the plus side, there are no immediate financial issues. In the last five or six years, we’ve worked tremendously hard to secure the college finances which means we can weather this storm, at least for the moment,” he said.“We have time to plan. We won’t let our mission in education, research and innovation be derailed.“I’m not saying there won’t be challenges, seen and unforeseen. But we are fortunate in our remarkable global community - we know that you will work with us to secure the future of our great university.”OnlineDr Prendergast said teaching at the university was now entirely online and almost all exams will be also completed online.In addition, April’s graduations will be live-streamed and students conferred with their degrees in absentia.He also provided new details over the college’s decision to ask students to leave college accommodation, where possible, after eight cases of coronavirus were confirmed among the Trinity community.The move sparked controversy among some students who criticised the university’s handling of the matter.“ This was on the advice of Trinity GPs who were particularly concerned that the shared living accommodation in rooms and halls makes self-isolation very difficult, and who emphasized the need for swift action in the face of such a fast-spreading virus,” Dr Prendergast said.“However, students who cannot return home for a variety of reasons are remaining in college accommodation - the reduction in numbers staying means that we can better look after everyone.”"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe second raft of measures announced by the Government in an attempt to curb the spread of coronavirus represent a considered and proportionate response to a challenge that is growing by the day.The measures, set out on Tuesday, will only add to the economic misery already heaped upon citizens by Covid-19, and have failed to satisfy those voices calling for a complete lockdown of society.However, the fact that they fall around the centre line of what might have been done does not mean they amount to a fudge. Throughout this crisis, Ireland has taken a measured, consistent and evidence-led approach to the challenge involved.Where countries on either side of us have flip-flopped and changed tack with astonishing rapidity, the Irish authorities have followed a graduated approach based on the best available international and local advice.In other countries, some politicians have played politics with the pandemic, but in the State the lead has been taken by scientific experts, with the Government effectively playing a support role that has demanded the provision of large sums of money. Policy mistakesIn common with other countries, Ireland has made mistakes along the way. There was a failure to clamp down on travel from problem areas, notably Italy, quickly enough. Ireland also seems to be behind the curve on the provision of personal protective equipment for health staff and on testing.This was apparent again over the past 24 hours when the criteria for testing were altered again, effectively meaning people with only one Covid-19 symptom will not be tested. It is hard not to see this as a change designed to cut the demand for testing, which was running out of all proportion to the system’s ability to provide the service. It now seems the official approach is the same as that of the World Health Organisation – “test, test, test” – but with the rider “though not just yet”.At Tuesday’s briefing by the National Public Health Emergency Team, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan freely accepted that public health officials had “cast their net too widely” when loosening their criteria a fortnight ago.At the time, the focus was on the removal of travel from overseas as a criterion for being tested for the virus. However, it was the decision to test people with just one symptom that really opened the floodgates.The resulting 20,000 people a day who sought testing included people with other ailments, including flu, as well as a good proportion of the “worried well”. Lost among the numbers were the real priority cases, such as healthcare workers and, at times, the more severely ill.Now Ireland is adopting the World Health Organisation (WHO) case definition for Covid-19, which requires two signs – fever and a respiratory symptom such as a cough or breathlessness.This begs the question why didn’t we adopt the WHO rules in the first place? Clogged systemThere are uncomfortable echoes of the cervical cancer controversy here – where an offer of free repeat smears to the wider population of women ended up clogging up the system and creating months of delay in the screening programme.In the current situation, too many patients are waiting too long to be tested or too long to get their results. Hopefully, this is only a short-term problem and the backlog will be cleared, as a prelude to wider testing in the population.Still, in this calm-before-the-surge moment, there are some encouraging signs. There is widespread adherence to social distancing the number of contacts of confirmed cases is dropping and the number of diagnosed cases is growing slightly more slowly than expected – though this may be due to the seven-day time lag caused by testing delays.It is still too early to know whether the measures adopted in Ireland will work, but at least the hands on the tiller seem to know where we are headed.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4212806.1585219539!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus the science how physical distancing works and saves lives","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople stand on designated areas to maintain social distancing as they queue outside a medical store during a government-imposed nationwide lockdown as a preventive measure against coronavirus in Srinagar in India. Photograph: Tauseef MustafaAFP via Getty ImagesPlaying the antibody cardWar on Covid-19 is three-pronged: a longer-term race to produce a vaccine effective in large populations generation of treatments (antivirals) for deployment in the meantime and use of coronavirus antibodies known as immunoglobulins. These are proteins produced by plasma cells in the bloodstream and used by the immune system to neutralise pathogens such as viruses.Presence of antibodies confirms infection, so testing for their presence can be a valuable indication of immunity, especially for those working in healthcare.In addition, antibodies have big potential as a treatment. Like the global race to produce a vaccine, numerous labs are working on developing quick antibody tests, some of which may even be self-testing kits.Meanwhile New York health authorities plan to begin collecting plasma from people who have recovered and inject the antibody-rich fluid into patients still fighting the virus in clinical trials. Known as convalescent plasma, it has been used for centuries, and was deployed during the horrendous flu pandemic of 1918, but not in recent decades.Some experts say the treatment, though somewhat primitive, might be the best hope for combating coronavirus until more sophisticated therapies are developed, which could take months.Infusions of convalescent plasma were associated with milder symptoms and shorter hospital stays for some patients during the 2002 SARS outbreak, and initial reports from China suggest it might also be effective in dulling the effects of Covid-19.The treatment is not without risks. There is danger in giving a patient the wrong type of blood or inadvertently transmitting other pathogens in a transfusion, but safety advances in recent decades have made adverse outcomes rare. Initially, it will be offered to critically ill patients. Once proven to be safe and effective, it’s likely to work best with patients before symptoms become too severe.The US pharmaceutical Regeneron, which has a large “industrial operations and product supply facility” employing 1,000 people in Limerick, has also identified hundreds of antibodies that could treat or prevent coronavirus.It confirmed its “plans to initiate large-scale manufacturing by mid-April with antibody cocktail therapy, with potential to enter human clinical studies by early summer”.“We don’t disclose which products are made where,” a spokeswoman said – though it’s recruiting specialist staff for its Limerick plant. Longer term antibody tests will also help researchers understand how long immunity to the virus lasts a key issue for any future vaccine.The science of physical distancingThe point of the Covid-19 spear looms ever closer. That’s when it will cause its maximum toll – the top of that dreaded cases curve.At this stage of the pandemic with cases jumping daily, physical distancing within the community assumes critical importance hence the new, scaled-up restrictions with a tightening up on that key measure.Obviously, it fits with the strategies of wash your hands self-isolate if showing symptoms, coughsneeze into elbow and “test, test, test”.Transmission route: Physical distancing is required as Covid-19 spreads mainly from person-to-person, i.e.– Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 2 metres)– Through respiratory droplets carried in the air produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.Justifying the approach: Physical distancing is not a notional precaution, it’s a scientifically-justified action based on mathematics, understanding of social patterns and medical knowledge (epidemiology). It hinges around determining the r0 (pronounced ‘r-nought’) value of an infectious disease.The r0 for Covid-19 is estimated at 2.5. So a typical person who is infected will spread it to 2.5 - between two and three people – during the period they’re infectious. Without controls, a single case would lead to 1,000 cases after four weeks.The objective is to get that figure down to below one. At that point the disease stops spreading the typical person who is infected isn’t passing on the virus to anyone else before they recover.A complex factoring in to how long the virus remains infectious cultural considerations (extent to which people have physical contact), transmission data and immunitysusceptiblity considerations are all part of the r0 computation.Key actions with Covid-19: All told with this pandemic, ensuring it has less opportunity to spread to other people, by seeing less of them, and by reducing the chance during an interaction that the disease will pass to you – or from you to another person – are critical community actions. That’s what forces the r0 down in this instance. So it’s back to the five-step strategy including physical distancing.The proof: This is where contact tracing comes into its own, i.e. determining who an infected person has been in contact with – when they were likely to be infectious – and ensuring all self isolate.Already Irish actions (notably physical distancing) taken so far confirm personal contacts have been reduced from 20 to 5, and of late tend to be confined to households.That said, given the current trajectory of cases and deaths, public health specialists say a further 75 per cent reduction is needed to ensure the curve is forced down. So it’s back to physical distancing in the knowledge it works and saves lives.Grounds for optimism– Tell-tale signs: Researchers are confirming the distinct traits of SARS-CoV-2 (the medical term for the virus) and key differences with influenza. It’s very stable and does not mutate much, i.e. alter its genetic mix as it spreads. In contrast, flu is like a pack of cards (made up of genetic parts) that shuffle every year. So there is good chance of generating an effective Covid-19 vaccine, while the annual flu vaccine is the best bet of leading immunologists, virologists and epidemiologists.– The scale of human decency: Communities are mobilising to help the most vulnerable within their localities. Action by industry and universities with to the aim of helping those at the healthcare frontline is equally impressive. DCU’s Nano Research Facility is switching operations to make sanitisers, and Trinity’s Biomedical Sciences Institute gathered all of its gloves, gowns and face masks and sent them to St James’s Hospital up the road. Such actions are replicated across the country and are saving lives.– Chink of hope on Italian front: There are tiny signs infection rate in Italy is moderating, notwithstanding its continuing, appalling death toll. These may merely be data blips. It suggests, none the less, the overall rate of increase is slowing as if the pandemic is losing momentum inside a country where it has nowhere to go. Ireland cannot ease its curtailment efforts as rising cases here show no indication yet we can avoid the same fate of Italy.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"There have now been a total of 1,819 cases in the State and 19 deathsGovernment is still trying to assist more than 2,000 Irish citizens in 86 countriesD\u0026aacuteil hears concerns about companies refusing to honour claims for loss of businessPrendergast reassures secondary students hoping to study at Trinity that it will welcome new students in the autumnVaradkar says Brexit means Ireland better placed to confront Covid-19Volume normally experienced over 10 months being filed in as many working daysMove as a result of \u0026lsquoanticipated demand on acute services, especially adult services\u0026rsquoPSNI\u0026rsquos Paula Hilman one of three new assistant commissionersMembers of the group are reluctant to enter coalition with the two larger parties without another small party on boardDoctors and nurses advised to leave copy of ID on dashboard to avoid clamping feesTen deaths and 231 people tested positive for coronavirus in NorthWay to allow farmers sell cattle while the marts are closed is being soughtPaula Farell has pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter of Wayne McQuillan\u0026lsquoIt is just so surreal and so opposite to what the church is about. it is singularly terrible\u0026rsquoCatriona Golden\u0026rsquos tells parents homeschooling and working is \u0026lsquoabsolutely not possible\u0026rsquoJudge told of effects on number of young people and their families of Covid-19 crisisMicheal Bayly (26) says he wants to care for his children while partner awaits Covid-19 testStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4211226.1585077625!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus irish bartenders in new york pack up and return home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish bars, such as O’Keefe’s in Brooklyn (pictured), have had to limit their business to takeout and deliveries since March 16th. Photograph:  Kevin DugganLittle more than a week ago, Co Mayo native Amy Brett was gearing up for the busiest time of the year at the Bailey Pub near Wall Street as St Patrick’s Day dawned. Today, she is back in Cavan, quarantining in a holiday home before returning to her family.Along with four fellow Irish bartenders who have returned from New York, she is in a 14-day self-imposed quarantine at the holiday home until they are able to return to their families.For the past five years, Brett has worked in New York bars, which have been brought to a standstill by the outbreak of coronavirus.Rumours of a closure order by New York mayor, Bill de Blasio floated after organisers postponed the St Patrick’s Day parade down Fifth Avenue for the first time in 258 years.On March 16th, the mayoral order finally hit.Together with the four fellow Irish bartenders, Brett immediately made plans to head for Ireland: “I panicked and I thought the best thing to do was to come home. God forbid you’re stuck here,” she said.The business curbs have devastated bars and restaurants. Already, one prominent company, the Union Hospitality Group has laid off 2,000 employees – about 80 per cent of its workforce – according to a report by the food blog Eater.A Co Sligo man on a year-long J-1 visa decided to cut his losses and leave his Manhattan bar job: “I could have lasted maybe a month or two, but I would have been out of pocket pretty quickly,” he said.Unable to be identified because his visa did not allow him work, he came back to Ireland: “I came home and there’s no hugging, it’s all touch elbows and keep your distance. It’s quite a strange way to come back.”He and many others have had to abandon their apartments, with New York Irish Facebook groups filling up with dozens of listings for rooms in popular Irish neighbourhoods across Brooklyn and Queens in the past week.The decision of whether to stick out the pandemic, or return home faces many Irish in New York and other places, according to Chicago-based Irish-American immigration attorney Fiona McEntee.“It’s a pretty scary time and some people just want to be surrounded by their family,” she said, though she cautioned that “the last thing” anyone potentially exposed to the virus should be doing is “to jump on a flight”.Freelance workers are being particularly affected, says Edelle Kenny, a New York-based producer who works on reality TV shows for American stations like the Discovery Channel and TLC.“I just had two major contracts dropped, which would be the equivalent of a year’s wage,” she said.She does not get health and unemployment benefits because she is self-employed: “We’re kind of left in the lurch.”“You come over here and you start building a life for yourself. Six years is a long time to be here and now you’re thinking, will this just throw everything off, by no fault of your own or anyone’s fault.”Ms Kenny is also on an interim work permit due to expire in May, while she transitions from a two-year Green Card to a 10-year one and she’s concerned that her immigration case could get caught in a backlog and delays with the authorities.Some Irish people, however, are stuck in the US because they will not be able to get back in if they leave now: “If you’re not a Green Card holder or a US citizen you do need to think about the immigration aspects of this, especially with the travel ban,” said Fiona McEntee.For now, Amy Brett and her friends plan to return to New York once it is safe to do so but she said if the situation persists for several months, many more Irish will pack up and leave the city.“If New York bars don’t reopen by May, you’ll see a lot of people move home to Ireland,” she said.“But we’re pure anxious, it’s just not knowing when we’re going to go back.

We arrived to El Chalten on March 14th and first tried to leave the town on March 17th.”However, they were told they were banned from travelling when officials noticed they had spent some time in Chile. “Local authorities forbid all backpackers from travelling until they complete a 14-day quarantine. On learning this we then checked into a small hostel in El Chalten with 17 other people from around the world.“The situation evolved so rapidly and continues to do so. The Irish Embassy encouraged us to fly home as soon as possible, but couldn’t even secure a mode of transport to bring us to an airport,” she said.Flight cancelledThe couple eventually made it to Buenos Aires where they secured seats on an Air Canada flight to Toronto on Wednesday. They planned to then get a flight to London. However, the Toronto flight was cancelled.“According to Air Canada, it was due to government implications the flight was cancelled. The airline also didn’t provide an alternative option,” she said. “We are emailing the Irish Embassies in Buenos Aires, in Toronto and Ottawa, to see if they can assist us in getting to Toronto.” The Government is still trying to assist more than 2,000 Irish citizens who are trying to get back to Ireland from 86 countries. Liz Canavan, a senior official at the Department of the Taoiseach, said 170 Irish citizens were repatriated from Western Australia, arriving back in Dublin on Thursday.StrandedHundreds of other Irish citizens who are stranded in parts of Australia have appealed for help from the Government. Ms Canavan said this week the Government was struggling to help the stranded citizens as countries close off airspace and ground airlines at short notice.She said officials were working with Aer Lingus and British Airways to try repatriate the 135 Irish citizens, most of them backpackers, who have registered for repatriation from Peru since the country ordered the closure of its borders on March 16th. She urged any Irish citizen in Peru who had not already done so to contact the Embassy of Ireland in Santiago, Chile, which is the nearest embassy.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4213276.1585251941!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"regional independent group of tds most likely target to be partners in coalition","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Lowry: “If anyone steps into government, they are stepping in knowing difficult decisions will have to be made.” Photographer: Dara Mac Dónaill However, members of the group have said privately they would be reluctant to enter coalition with the two larger parties without another smaller political party on board.

Asked if a second group of Independents would suffice, the Regional Group TD said it would not.“What’s critical for us is stability. It’s not in our interest to facilitate a government that would last only months, or a year or two.”The group is the largest of three Independent groups in the current Dáil.

The Independent Group also has six TDS, but only three of its number – Michael Fitzmaurice, Michael McNamara and Marian Harkin – have expressed interest in government formation. Mr Fitzmaurice has submitted a policy paper to the parties outlining a large number of priorities, including issues pertaining to his home region of the west of Ireland.All of the smaller parties have ruled out participating in a Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil coalition. However, some feel there is a sense that the Labour Party might review its current position following the outcome of its leadership contest in early AprilThere were no talks held between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael om Thursday, but both parties have said they were pleased with the progress of negotiations on Wednesday.A spokesman for Verona Murphy, a member of the Regional Independent Group, said the Wexford TD, who was previously a Fine Gael election candidate, would have no problem with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar remaining in place for the duration of the current crisis.“Negotiating a programme for government in the middle of the worst public health crisis to hit the country in a century is hardly an ideal situation, and Verona would personally have no problem leaving Leo in place for the duration of the crisis, and then a programme for government can be negotiated,” the spokesman said. The spokesman said Ms Murphy also believes that in any negotiations Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil should first agree a policy document with each other before approaching Independents.This point was also made by Independent Tipperary TD Michael Lowry, another member of the Regional Independent Group, who also said that those who enter government must be ready to make tough decisions and then stick to them.“When they have that done, they will present it to us for input,” Mr Lowry said of the two parties.“If anyone steps into government, they are stepping in knowing difficult decisions will have to be made,” said Mr Lowry, who has supported numerous governments in the past. “Hard times are ahead.”He said nobody participating in government would be making excessive demands, and said most knew it was a time to help the country recover and stabilise.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4212746.1585220784!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish tourists stranded in peru wait for government evacuation","story":"Elizabeth Canavan, Assistant Sec. General, Department of the Taoiseach has announced that 170 Irish citizens are en route to Ireland from Perth. The government are trying to help over 2,000 Irish citizens get home from abroad. Video: RTE News Now\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMarie Barry and Andrew Cotter, both from Cork,  arrived in Peru from Bolivia two days before the national lockdown was announced. The imposition of up to three months of quarantine on a hostel in Cusco after a Covid-19 cluster was detected there has left Irish tourists stranded in the Peruvian city increasingly nervous as they wait for a Government evacuation to get underway.Peruvian health officials on Wednesday ordered what they described as “absolute quarantine” for between one and three months of the Pariwana hostel after two guests, one from the Netherlands and another from Finland, tested positive for coronavirus.Among the estimated 120 guests now subjected to the lockdown is Belfast tourist Rhys McKendry. “When the announcement first came out a lot of people actually started crying. To be told two people had tested positive was a pretty big blow,” he said.Tests on the two guests were ordered after they showed symptoms of having the virus. A previous guest is believed to have started showing symptoms after returning home. Peru ordered a national lockdown on March 16th and has all but sealed its air, land and sea borders, stranding thousands of foreign tourists.The news of the strict quarantine at the Pariwana quickly spread on WhatsApp among other Irish tourists stuck in Cusco. Many wondered if they should leave their own hostels for Airbnb accommodation to avoid being caught up in a similar Covid-19 outbreak. They said they were afraid this could lead to them missing an evacuation flight being organised by the Government.Around 135 Irish tourists, most of them backpackers, have registered for repatriation from Peru. Tánaiste Simon Coveney told RTÉ on Sunday an agreement has been reached between British Airways and Aer Lingus to charter a flight from Lima “in the next few days”.In a statement on Wednesday the Department of Foreign Affairs said while an agreement was in place for a flight to go, “internal travel remains heavily restricted and many of our citizens are located hundreds of miles away from the international airport. We are working 24 hours to get the necessary transport and permissions in place to move them.”News that flights left Lima for the UK, Spain and Switzerland caused frustration about the delay in starting the repatriation among some of those stuck in Cusco. “It can be done. It is being done. But from our perspective it seems to be very slow and that is worrying us,” says Mr Cotter.In the Pariwana hostel, Mr McKendry says he has not given up hope of being able to get on the repatriation flight. He is yet to be tested for Covid-19. “I believe being tested might be my only option of getting out, so I am going to ask the doctors if it is possible,” he says.Since the quarantine was announced the Pariwana’s guests are being confined to their dorms for 23 hours with management warning of the possibility “we have more infections among us”. The hostel’s TV and computer rooms are now sealed off. The two tourists who tested positive are isolated in separate dorms from other guests.The Peruvian authorities said any guests who failed to obey strict social distancing measures could face between five to 10 years in jail. Each guest has been issued with a mask and assigned their own plate and cutlery. “The staff are staying with us in the hostel which shows how committed they are and we’re getting three meals a day. At lunch we were just two to a table that the day before sat eight,” says Mr McKendry.Late on Wednesday night Irish time, the Irish Embassy in Chile tweeted: “We are aware of the 2 cases of coronavirus confirmed in a hostel in Cusco in Peru. Neither of the people with positive tests are Irish citizens. Our Ambassador spoke today with the one Irish citizen staying at the same hostel and they will remain in contact over the coming days.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: UK death toll rises by more than 100 in a day for first timeCriminals face up to two years in jail for \u0026#39weaponising\u0026#39 coronavirus by coughing at emergency service workers, says top prosecutorIt is our duty to obey lockdown rules, says Priti Patel, as police get powers to arrest, fine and use reasonable force for those who refuseComment: Is coronavirus a terrifying killer or a manageable risk?

In the Before Time these were the words of someone sheepishly checking a microphone. Now they are a valid strategy for fighting a global pandemic. What an odd period of our lives this is.To escape it, there is broad agreement that increasing testing is key. So it is heartening to learn it will soon be possible for UK residents to take a test which gives a result within 15 minutes. You won’t even have to leave your home (let’s overlook the fact you’re not allowed), they can be delivered to your door.  The tests do not confirm whether you’re currently a corona-carrier, instead they will look for the antibodies which suggest you’ve already had the virus and developed some immunity. They will, though, require a finger prick, so you’ll have to be brave. See how they work below.There’s an order in for 3.5m already, with millions more expected soon. Is Matt Hancock stockpiling?

But in the context of worse-case scenarios of 18 months of lockdown and a very real possibility we’ll all complete Netflix before summer, this has to be a boost. Returning to the scene of yesterday’s optimism, Sarah Knapton reports that a new symptom-monitoring app suggests 6.5m of the UK population, nearly one in ten, are already infected with Covid-19. As it was yesterday: a frightening thing to read. But looking on the bright side, as we are obliged to on this specific page of the ’s website, that puts a new spin on the current death rate. The current number of “known” UK cases is more like 10,000, which makes the awful number of confirmed deaths even more stark. That number becomes a little easier to take if you entertain the possibility that the actual number of UK cases is far higher.One more heartwarming tale from Northern Ireland, where O’Neills (it makes sportswear, not disappointing pubs) has reopened its factory to help make medical scrubs.

The problem was that, earlier in the day, he had suggested there might be as many as 600,000. Asked to account for the difference, he said his earlier answer had taken into account asymptomatic cases. So what is it? 54,000 or 600,000?Italy is not alone. Earlier this week, the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Tokyo published a report into the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined in February with more than 800 of the 3,711 people on board eventually diagnosed with Covid-19. According to the report, cited by the Japan Times, four-fifths of those infected showed no symptoms or just mild symptoms. Scans showed their lungs had suffered some physical consequences from the virus, but the patients had not been led by their symptoms to believe they were infected. Quite the reverse.Even in China, the poster child for lockdown and trace tactics which is edging back towards business as usual, there is uncertainty about asymptomatic cases. Estimates are classified. Officials insist all asymptomatic cases are unearthed by so-called contact tracing, yet even if this is true and every such case is detected, the numbers are not trivial: the South China Morning Post obtained details which suggested some 40,000 asymptomatic cases had been discovered in this way. It\u0027s hard not to believe there are many more. One way or another, it is clear that far more of us have, or have had, Covid-19, than the official figures tell us. But how many more? Only mass testing will give us a real picture of what is happening, and thus what needs to happen at a far greater rate in the UK than is currently the case:Without mass testing, two very different pictures of the spread of the virus are emerging. On the one hand, there is the optimistic scenario, suggested by an Oxford paper which on Wednesday gained a huge amount of attention for a model suggesting that, given the current state of the UK outbreak, some 68 per cent of the population would have been infected by 19032020 – some 45 million of us, by last week, most presumably without even knowing it.Such a result would be dramatic. The outbreak is overblown, it would confirm. Most of us have already had the disease and are now fine. The NHS has survived the epidemic without even knowing it. But that was just one paper. There is another scenario. This one is that yes, there are lots of asymptomatic carriers (though far from 45 million), but rather than being beacons of hope and joy, they represent hidden problems – mines sown among the rest of us, ready to explode and cause a new outbreak just when it appears we might be on top of this one. According to researchers at the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (in a paper awaiting peer review), children may represent such mines because only around 20 per cent of them develop clinical symptoms (as opposed to 70 per cent in older adults). Yet it is not yet clear how infectious such largely asymptomatic people are. This critical question must be resolved to effectively forecast and control Covid-19 epidemics, the authors note.Such infection is certainly possible. In Wuhan on Tuesday, the one new case was that of a doctor reportedly infected by an asymptomatic patient. And on the Diamond Princess, studies suggest some of the 20 per cent of infected passengers who  suffered serious symptoms either went several days without obvious outward signs of the condition or caught it from those who never went on to develop serious symptoms.So is the epidemic mostly over or every bit as bad as we think, with the potential to erupt when we imagine we\u0027re through the worst? A single truth emerges: we will only discover the genuine picture through mass blood testing – a simple finger-prick tests that works like this:The above test must be followed, once the outbreak (whatever its true size) is controlled, by picking representative samples in the population to screen regularly, just as such samples are quizzed by pollsters to get a more or less accurate snapshot of national voting intention.In the middle of a mass global outbreak, it seems impossible to carry out whole population testing. Yet fate has twice thrown up unusual circumstances in which this has happened. The Diamond Princess was one such. The other was the 3,000-strong town of Vo, in Italy, where the entire population was tested after one of its citizens became the first to die of the disease.There, too, researchers found a significant proportion of the population (three per cent) had been infected without knowing it, representing the vast bulk of the 89 cases discovered. More generally, in the researchers\u0027 estimation, asymptomatic or quasi-symptomatic subjects represent a good 70 per cent of all virus-infected people.There is good news in this: mass testing in Vo meant there were no further deaths. And factoring in asymptomatic cases also dramatically lowers the disease\u0027s mortality rate, which is currently based only on those who receive tests – usually those showing obvious or severe symptoms. And finally, if you had a fever or a hacking cough earlier in the year and, looking back, now swear you must have had Covid-19 – well, you might just be right.

These are not decisions I take on my own in my little office.He conceded, however, that if infection rates do start to soar and Sweden ends up in a similar situation to that Italy or Spain has faced, he would face criticism.Of course, I and the agency will be to blame, for sure. I\u0027m quite aware of that, he said. But I would feel a lot worse taking a lot of decisions I don\u0027t believe in and for things to go wrong, than to take decisions I and the agency very much do believe in and for things not to work out.Unlike Denmark and Norway, which both shut schools and kindergartens at the start of last week, and where, in Denmark at least, any gathering of more than 10 people is banned, much of life in Sweden remains unchanged.  The government has only banned events with more than 500 participants, issuing a recommendation that those who visit pubs and restaurants should be seated at a table rather than mingling at a bar, and that people taking public transport should think carefully about whether it\u0027s necessary. Those who fall ill with coronavirus-like symptoms need only wait two days after they feel well again before returning to work or school.The advice has not changed despite a surge of cases in Stockholm in recent days which led the city’s health chief Björn Eriksson to call for any help he could get handling the influx of coronavirus patients.The storm is here, Mr Eriksson said, announcing that 18 patients had died in the region in the preceding 24 hours, doubling its total death tally in a single daily update.We don\u0027t know how far we\u0027ve come yet in this storm, but it\u0027s going to get worse.At the school gates, opinion was mixed as the wisdom of the Swedish government’s outlier approach to the pandemic.I do think it\u0027s a bit irresponsible, said one father picking up his daughter from Västra Skolan in Malmö, contrasting Sweden\u0027s open approach with the strict lockdown imposed in his native Denmark across the Öresund straits in his native Denmark.I think they should be doing more.Even children whose parents he knew were home sick with coronavirus-like symptoms, he complained, were still allowed to come to classes, so long as the children themselves were symptom-free.In my opinion, they are very relaxed, said Rosaline Abugiche, and she picked up her daughter Ellen Ruth. Almost all places are still open and it\u0027s getting worse and worse. Everybody\u0027s worried about it.Johan Heander, another parent, was more relaxed.I think Sweden and the UK were the only country\u0027s being sensible about the whole thing, and then the UK got scared and closed down.Sweden has decided not to close schools because in a country where stay-at-home parents are almost unheard of, the country\u0027s health agencies believe it would remove at least a quarter of the workforce, and an even higher share in the health sector. Closing schools would also put more children on the streets, increasing the risk of vulnerable elderly people becoming infected. If grandparents are called in to help out with childcare, it could even increase the infection exposure of the most at-risk group.Mr Tegnell also argues that there is little evidence for the shutdown measures seen across Europe.The only studies they have done are on flu and flu is quite different, and even with flu, it should be done at a later stage, he said.  The other thing is that you cannot keep schools closed for very long. That would have huge negative effects on the children, not only their education, but also on their health. So if you do close schools, you really need to do it at the most crucial time.Mr Tegnell also noted that, unlike in Italy and Spain, it is very rare in Sweden for several generations of a family to live together under the same roof, making it much easier to isolate the vulnerable older generation.We have age segregation in Sweden, which is certainly quite different to most other countries, he said. Elderly people meet mostly elderly people and younger people meet mostly younger people. And I think that gives us a reasonable chance to actually protect our elderly.But expert opinion has been ided. As early as March 10, a group of doctors and researchers wrote a joint opinion piece in Sweden\u0027s leading medical newspaper warning of a potential disastrous impact on Sweden\u0027s health service if tougher actions were not taken.  On Tuesday, more than 2,000 eminent Swedish researchers and university professors sent an open letter to the government calling for tougher measures.I get the feeling that they want to spread the infection to get an immunity, but it\u0027s pretty cynical because it will be at the price of hundreds, if not thousands of lives, said Olle Kämpe, a professor at Sweden\u0027s leading medical university the Karolinska Institutet, who was among the authors.For now it is too early to say how the pandemic will play out. Sweden has recorded 2,806 confirmed cases of infection, which at 281 cases per million people puts it below Denmark and Norway, and just slightly ahead of the UK.After Wednesday\u0027s surge in Stockholm, it has recorded 66 deaths, which at 6.5 deaths per million inhabitants, remains below that of locked-down Denmark (7.3) and only fractionally above that of the UK (6.2).So far, the healthcare system is starting to feel under pressure in Stockholm, but is still just about managing, and if the strain gets too much for existing hospitals, the Swedish army has erected a field hospital on the site of the city\u0027s biggest conference centre.Mr Tegnell conceded his strategy was not without risk.  We are just trying to slow it, he added, because this disease will never go away. It will come back. If you manage, like South Korea to get rid of it, even they say that they count on it coming back.Stopping it might even be negative, because you would have a pent-up possible spread of the disease, and then once you open the gates, there is a possibility that there would be an even worse outcome.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/24/13/pri147543379.jpg","title":"coronavirus rishi sunak self employed wages security","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The government has, rightly, come a long way in a short time\u0026nbspin the great\u0026nbspCovid-19\u0026nbspworkers’ bailout – and don\u0027t bet on this being the end of the journeyOn the face of it, the self-employed are getting parity with employees in the great Covid-19 bailout.Government funding of 80 per cent of their income, backdated to the beginning of March, and a £2,500-per-month cap in a scheme lasting for at least three months.There will be no cap on the total support to be provided, meaning the cost will likely run into the billions of pounds.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSo far, so similar to what the chancellor announced for employees last week.

And they’ve swallowed a lot of late.It seems that Rishi Sunak wasn’t planning to do anything initially for the self-employed beyond boosting the benefits system.This was never tenable given the fact that this group of workers has grown so rapidly as a share of the workforce in recent years and that they are, on average, less well off than employees.In the past, many would actually have been regular employees but for the perverse incentives of the tax system and cost-cutting employers.Government support for low and middle-income employees but not the low and middle-income self-employed would have been manifestly unjust.The government has – rightly – come a long way in a short time on this.However, with joblessness already rising fast and businesses struggling with the support schemes already set up, it would be rash to bet against ministers having to go further still in the coming weeks of this crisis.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People are going to be waiting for help, likely until May or June as the bureaucracy to deal with this system is put in place.This risks pushing the self-employed into debt or will discourage them from staying at home even when they need to due to ill health.One of the key justifications for providing government funding for self-employed workers\u0027 earnings was to remove the financial incentive to go into work despite the risk of spreading coronavirus.Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, urged the government to introduce a dedicated hardship fund for self-employed people who are struggling while waiting for grants to be made.“Nearly every single call we are taking at our Business Debtline service is from self-employed people affected by the impact of Coronavirus, said Ms Elson.\u0026nbspThe electricians, plumbers and taxi drivers we are hearing from, who cannot work from home, are losing money by the hour – and telling them they can try and access Universal Credit is not enough.Accountants pointed to potential gaps in the new scheme. “The limitations do stand out, said Duncan Swift, president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3.There are quite a few gaps in the support: for people who have only recently started working for themselves or who pay themselves through idends, there may be no help at all.Payments will be calculated based on each worker\u0027s last three years\u0027 self-assessment tax returns.

When someone finishes work and leaves their desk, for instance, their computer can then be given over to science projects around the world, allowing researchers to carry out calculations on hardware that would otherwise be switched off.Before the outbreak of coronavirus, Folding@Home was a relatively small example of one of those projects, with about 30,000 people signing up their computers to help fight diseases such as cancer or Alzheimer\u0027s.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsAt the time of publication, more than a million CPUs and GPUs have been active in the project, according to statistics on its website.Together, those processors allowed the computer to break through the exaFLOP, according to the director of the project, Greg Bowman from the Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine. That amounts to an unprecedented number of operations per second.Professor Bowman also warned people who were part of the project that their computers might actually be idle, since so many people have signed up to take part in the project that the system is struggling to support its work.Folding@Home runs a devoted Covid-19 part of its website where people can sign up their computers to help.Computing projects around the world – including more straightforward supercomputers – are working to run simulations that together attempt to understand how the proteins at the centre of the outbreak work, and how they can be fought against.Professor Bowman has publicly shared some of the results of those simulations on Twitter.If scientists are able to get a better picture of the moving parts of a protein, they might also be able to discover where the weak points, or druggable sites, are. Scientists may then be able to work on drugs that help attack those pockets, and in doing so fight against the disease.​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It offers video tutorials and guidance on how to pass the agency’s fitness test, with requirements for a good score ranging from completing 58 sit-ups in one minute, to running 1.5 miles in less than 9 minutes.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe FBI’s website claims the best way to use the app is by\u0026nbspenabling location and movement tracking.\u0026nbsp”Use your phone’s GPS and accelerometer for a more realistic PFT\u0026nbspexperience,” it states.Privacy advocates were quick to warn users to avoid the app, with digital rights group Fight for the Future tweeting in all-caps: “Do not — and we cannot stress this next part enough — download this app.”Coronavirus: FBI stockpiles hand sanitiser to prepare for pandemicNon-profit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen warned: “Looking to get ripped while ceding your location data to the FBI?

Do not download this app, look at the app permissions ... This is shameful.”In a 2018 press release announcing the app’s release, the agency claimed that it “does not collect personal user data”.A spokesperson told\u0026nbspThe Independent: “The app does not gather or save any personal information other than what you select for your profile.

However, consumer nervousness is still understandably widespread – so the extent to which online channels can compensate for lost high street spending is yet to be seen.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The club - formed 15 years ago this spring in protest against Malcolm Glazer’s leveraged takeover of Manchester United - are just one of many in the non-league system fearing that the coronavirus pandemic will not only end their season but cause significant financial damage. And yet, their response to the unprecedented problems facing English football can provide a lesson for those further up the pyramid.Last week, the club’s board released a statement which caught the eye for two reasons. Firstly, while Uefa, the Premier League, the EFL and other footballing bodies held meetings on how best to squeeze the remainder of the 2019-20 season into a truncated schedule, FC announced they were “working to a scenario that the six remaining home games will not be played, and we will not resume until September”. Essentially, they declared their season was over.Secondly and more significantly, as promotion-chasing and relegation-battling clubs up and down the country lawyered up for the long and litigious months ahead, FC declared that they would not apply pressure - legally or otherwise - on those who must now come up with a fair way of ending the season. “There is little chance of a decision being possible that will satisfy all,” the club said. “We will accept any decision that the league reaches in this regard.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFC have every reason to fight their corner. After being relegated last year, Neil Reynolds’ side currently sit second in the Northern Premier League in the third tier of non-league football. Defeat to leaders South Shields in their last game before football’s suspension made automatic promotion an unlikely prospect. Even so, FC would have enjoyed home advantage in the end-of-season play-offs and would have been considered favourites to return to the National League North at the first time of asking.Even so, the club’s board, staff and players are united in accepting whatever fate comes their way. “With the history of the club, there is a wider perspective,” says Sam Mullock, FC’s deputy chair. “Fans used to say every time we kick off is a victory. Just having our own football club is victory enough. Success on the pitch is not everything for us. And we\u0027re absolutely not going to be fighting for a particular outcome which favours us in the league. I think the leagues need to be left in peace, to think about the issues and come to us with a fair way forward.”It is a refreshing stance. A remarkable one, in fact, given that this crisis is an existential threat to many clubs at non-league level. Mullock expects FC to incur a loss of around £100,000 due to coronavirus cancellations - £70,000 from six or seven lost home games and another £30,000 through functions, events and filming at Broadhurst Park which can no longer go ahead. For a club which emerged out of messy, well-documented internal struggles four years ago with financial problems to solve, that is a substantial hit to swallow.To mitigate it, FC have sought donations from a 2,087-strong membership base, the people through which the club is democratically run. “That\u0027s the strength of being a member-owned club. People are that extra bit invested,” says Mullock. “The first day the link went live, we had £600 donations. On Saturday, people were donating what they had spent in the bar, on a programme, things like that.” This will help to pay club staff and three contracted first-team players.The rest of the squad are on non-contract agreements - pay-as-you-play, essentially - and they tend to supplement their income through other precarious part-time work. The old FA Cup third round day cliché of builders, electricians and ‘postmen who always deliver’ is becoming less and less relevant at the non-league level nowadays. Personal trainers, youth workers and carers\u0026nbspare far more common. Whether their football wages are covered by the government\u0027s furloughed workers scheme is unclear.But FC’s current squad have embraced the club’s community ethos - “I think they\u0027ve all become members of the club. After games they stay around, shake hands, take photographs in the bar,” says Mullock - and to acknowledge that commitment, the club has set up a fund specifically for those players who will miss out on match fees due to the crisis. Members and supporters have been encouraged to donate separately to support a group of players who are not guaranteed to still be at the club next season by any means, but have nevertheless bonded with fans.At the same time, there is that ‘wider perspective’ Mullock mentioned earlier and the sense that the struggles of a football club should not be the main concern at the moment. “We\u0027re quite mindful that football is not the most important thing at the moment,” he says. “We can\u0027t just ram it down people\u0027s throats to start donating to a football club when people are worried about their own circumstances.”On Tuesday, steps three through to six of the non-league system decided - like FC a week earlier - that the 2019-20 season was effectively over. The National League was hoping to follow the Premier League and EFL’s example and extend the campaign into the summer but yesterday, they too fell into line. As the Isthmian League said in a strongly-worded statement, non-league clubs simply “do not have the financial resources to continue to honour player contracts indefinitely”.The Football Association must now help decide how to settle the season. Promotion and relegation may be enforced according to each team’s average points-per-game or the season could simply be declared null and void. If that happens, FC will lose out on and “one of the most satisfying and enjoyable seasons in the club’s history” will be scrubbed from the record. But if the game is to resolve the many questions posed by this crisis, more clubs will need to follow FC’s example, accept their fate and acknowledge there are more important things than football.FC United of Manchester\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest football headlines direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are also set to be Apple\u0027s first 5G iPhones, allowing it to integrate the faster data connections found in phones made by rivals such as Samsung.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe report did not indicate when the phone\u0027s launch could be pushed back to. It is likely that it will be aiming to release them by the holiday period towards the end of the year, at the very latest.Any decision on a postponement is likely to be made in May, the report indicated, and the timeline may not be finalised until staff are back at work after the coronavirus lockdown. Apple sent all of its staff home relatively early as the disease spread across the US, and they are still being told to work from home.In recent years, Apple has been on a very reliable schedule with iPhone launches.

He said he ventured out to the supermarket for the first time in two weeks on Wednesday.The online supermarket boss said Britons should avoid going to supermarkets at peak hours and only buy what they need.He called on Britons\u0026nbspto “make your meals work”.“If you buy a chicken, roast the chicken, have the roast chicken dinner, the following day turn it into a stir fry, the following day make it into soup,” he said.“You can make a relatively small amount of food go a long way and I think we live in a very profligate society today – we buy too much, we eat too much and we have to learn new ways.”Ocado has been operating at capacity during the crisis, and on Tuesday said it had around 10 times more demand for its services than it did before the outbreak began.Some British supermarkets have introduced stricter measures to protect their customers and staff.Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Asda plan to limit the number of shoppers allowed into their stores at any given time.Tesco boss Dave Lewis has written to customers saying staff will draw new floor markings in the checkout areas, install protective screens on checkouts, and introduce one-way aisles.“Our social distancing plans aim to protect customers from the moment they enter our car parks, to browsing products, to paying and finally exiting our stores,” he wrote.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These customers have priority over all slots.“Our customer careline has been inundated with requests from elderly and vulnerable customers – we have had one year’s worth of contacts in two weeks.“We have proactively contacted 270,000 customers who had already given us information that meant we could identify them as being in these groups,” he said.Mr Coupe, who apologised to regular online customers, said they have already booked in slots for 115,000 elderly, disabled and vulnerable customers this week.Meanwhile, Sainsbury’s said it is temporarily closing 12 convenience stores that have seen “significantly fewer customers in recent days as people are working from home”.The employees will move to neighbouring stores until these stores re-open.Elsewhere, shoppers at Asda have seen changes including markers on the floor to help them keep two metres apart, barriers, signs and announcements. The supermarket has also asked shoppers to ditch cash in favour of card payments.Lidl has announced it will install new donation boxes in store to collect for vulnerable families, extending a scheme that has been in place since 2017.All non-essential stores have been forced to close as Britons are told to stay inside as much as possible, and only leave for supplies and a brief daily exercise.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Now there\u0027s a danger that even more children will fall through the net.”Created with Sketch.Words at the window: Social isolation and the Coronavirus Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Agnetha Septimus, Matthew Septimus, and children Ezra and NoraHusband and wife filmmakers, Claire Ince and Ancil McKain pose for a portrait for the series by Shutterstock Staff Photographer, Stephen Lovekin, shot around the Ditmas Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, New YorkKhadijah Silver and son EliotAnna Beth Rousakis and daughter Mary RousakisMike Pergola and Denise Pergola with children Henry, Jack, and WillJean Davis and Danny Rosenthal, with children Simone, Naomi, and LeahLisa Draho and Josh Zuckerman, with children Ruby and AvaProfessor and activist Dr Kristin LawlerTom Smith and Laura Ross, with daughters Caroline, Elizabeth, and AbigailCallie Lovekin and Lucas LovekinAgnetha Septimus, Matthew Septimus, and children Ezra and NoraHusband and wife filmmakers, Claire Ince and Ancil McKain pose for a portrait for the series by Shutterstock Staff Photographer, Stephen Lovekin, shot around the Ditmas Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, New YorkKhadijah Silver and son EliotAnna Beth Rousakis and daughter Mary RousakisMike Pergola and Denise Pergola with children Henry, Jack, and WillJean Davis and Danny Rosenthal, with children Simone, Naomi, and LeahLisa Draho and Josh Zuckerman, with children Ruby and AvaProfessor and activist Dr Kristin LawlerTom Smith and Laura Ross, with daughters Caroline, Elizabeth, and AbigailCallie Lovekin and Lucas LovekinAnd Margaret Greenwood, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “These figures are shocking.

This is a health emergency – it cannot be business as usual.15-minute tests and new UK laws – coronavirus news you may have missed“Workplaces, even those deemed ‘essential’, should be doing all they can to ensure that their workers are able to work from home or, if they do have to attend work, that they can undertake social distancing.”And John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, urged the government to “shut down” firms he accused of “ignoring the lockdown”, saying: “They are putting all our lives at risk by their greed.”The evidence received by Ms Reeves\u0027s committee includes:* People still working at a home furnishings firm.

However, Mr Khan’s spokesman insisted ministers were told “countless times” that Tube frequencies reflect high levels of staff sickness and self-isolation.Shortly before 7am on Wednesday, a senior nurse named Danny posted on Twitter: “Another busy tube. Can we not stagger people’s start times so we aren’t all squashed on the same tube! This is unsafe and not fair!”Barry Trimble, who said his work involves ensuring cancer patients receive chemotherapy, posted an image of a busy Victoria line carriage shortly after 7am on Wednesday.“The Tube is packed, with social distancing impossible. We need more people to stay at home and more trains running in morning and evening peak.”The Tube is currently operating at around 50 per cent of its normal capacity during peak times. Transport for London\u0026nbsp(TfL)\u0026nbsphas pledged to “continue to run as much of a Tube service as we possibly can”.On Tuesday Mr Hancock said: “Transport for London should have the Tube running in full so that people travelling on the Tube are spaced out and can be further apart – obeying the two-metre rule wherever possible.“And there is no good reason in the information that I’ve seen that the current levels of Tube provision should be as low as they are.

Most of the apps are free – though of course anyone using them will still need to have a paid-for subscription to the streaming service itself.This program is arguably the most versatile of all the options, as it works with Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, HBO, Hulu, Netflix, Vimeo and YouTube.TwoSeven can be installed either through the FireFox or Google Chrome browser and offers both text-based chatting and video call capabilities.YouTube and Amazon Prime join Netflix by reducing streaming qualityAmazon Prime users fume over buffering on live streamsAn additional subscription fee is needed for some of the streaming services, though the paid features have been lowered in response to the coronavirus outbreak.​As its name suggests, this add-on is specific to Netflix. It is also limited in the ways it can be used, as it is only available on Chrome browsers on desktop or laptop computers.Despite the restricted functionality, Netflix Party remains the most popular of all the options and is used by more than 500,000 people around the world.The extension is free and is simple to download through the Chrome Web Store. It offers\u0026nbspsynchronised video playback and a chat box to interact with other people watching the movie or TV series.Unlike other options, however, it does not support video chat.This is like a free-version of TwoSeven, however it is still in its development stage and so is still a little rough around the edges.The beta version of\u0026nbsp​Metastream\u0026nbspis still a great option and works with a plethora of services, including Netflix, YouTube and Twitch.\u0026nbspIt is supported by both Chrome and Firefox and is straight forward to install and use.\u0026nbspOnce a session is started, new members can be added through a simple invite code.It also offers enhanced features like timestamp markers, so you can revisit favourite scenes.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But there’s simply no other option given the volume that we’re dealing with. We were not prepared for this.”\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesNurses who have treated Covid-19 patients have already contracted the virus, including Mount Sinai West nursing manager Kious Jordan Kelly, 48, who passed away on Tuesday.\u0026nbspIn a statement, the hospital said it was “deeply saddened by the passing of a beloved member of our nursing staff” and “taking every precaution possible to protect everyone” under the current circumstances.\u0026nbspMultiple medical professionals who spoke to\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspfor this report said they had been advised by their hospitals not to speak to the media amid the outbreak, but said they felt it was their obligation to keep the public informed about the severe working conditions they are facing amid the extreme surge of\u0026nbspCovid-19\u0026nbsppatients.\u0026nbsp“We are definitely on the front lines. It’s overwhelming,” Ese, a registered nurse at New York Presbyterian Hospital, told The Independent about the influx of Covid-19 patients in recent days. She asked to only be identified by her first name.\u0026nbspEse said New Yorkers “need to understand how overwhelmed” city hospitals have become due to the pandemic, with more than 20,000 confirmed cases as of Wednesday, as well as “the importance of self-isolating” amid the outbreak.She added: “It just doesn’t seem like there is a light at the end of the tunnel.”New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered the entirety of the state’s workforce to stay home as of Friday, excluding essential services, describing the move as “the ultimate step” to help flatten the curve and ensure hospitals don’t exceed their capacities.\u0026nbspStill, many people have continued to host large gatherings and effectively ignore the guidelines. If city residents continue failing to adhere to the stringent measures, health officials warned of a potentially catastrophic situation in which hospitals lack ICU beds, ventilators, face masks and even doctors to deal with the surge of patients.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This slows how fast the virus moves in our communities, which decreases how many people get infected, which slows the spread of the virus, and so on.“If we can do this NOW by limiting these exposures - at bars, restaurants, schools, etc - we can decrease the number of people coming to our ERs every day,” he added. “Our system will still be stressed, but not overwhelmed.”State officials have been in close communication with the federal government, which has committed to sending thousands of ventilators and additional military resources to cope with the sudden rise of critically ill patients.\u0026nbspBut several nurses said their hospitals began facing shortages well before the governor issued a stay-at-home order on Friday.\u0026nbspOne registered nurse at Stony Brook Medicine said their hospital began experiencing a “dangerous” shortage a week prior to the governor’s orders. The nurse, who worked in a surgical area prior to the pandemic, was moved to an ICU built for Covid-19 patients as the hospital cancelled all elective procedures.\u0026nbspHow to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your hands“It’s just going to get worse,” they said about the state’s shortage of PPE.Meanwhile, hospital residency programmes have taken the extraordinary measure of allowing their students to graduate early in order add a fleet of doctors to help fight the virus.\u0026nbspOne of those students, who is graduating from the Icahn School of Medicine and asked to remain anonymous, said “the work load will be greater than ever before” but “the time for training and education will be at an all time low” as hospitals become inundated with patients and resources remain scarce in the days ahead.\u0026nbsp“It’s hard to know at this point if we’ll be helping out substantially by bringing more staff” to city hospitals, they added, “or if we’ll be slowing down the work substantially by not knowing how to use certain electronic medical records, the appropriate people to consult, or the proper escalation of care in medical code situations.”\u0026nbspSome doctors have resigned themselves to the fact that they could very well become infected with the coronavirus as they continue to suffer the surge in patients combined with a lack of supplies.\u0026nbsp“We’re all scared and anxious, just like everyone else. We also know that we have a duty to our patients and the city,” Dr Slack said. “I think most of us have accepted the reality that there’s a good chance we will be contracting this virus at some point.

He died on 6 February after contracting the disease.His death set off a wave of outrage across major social media platforms, as citizens initiated a short-lived online campaign demanding freedom of speech. Relevant posts were deleted by the Chinese government within hours, but the incident further strengthened\u0026nbspcitizens’ determination to preserve the truth of the coronavirus outbreak.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Li Wenliang was a normal guy with a good conscience and people see themselves in him,” Yaqiu Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, told The Independent.“His death illustrates that anyone could die in this system of deception, suppression and zero accountability.”Several prominent citizen journalists tried to take advantage of the brief window of openness to reveal the real situation in Wuhan.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsChen Qiushi, Fang Bin and Li Zehua\u0026nbspwere briefly popular\u0026nbspafter\u0026nbspuploading rare video footage from Wuhan to Youtube and Twitter. However, all three were soon forced into disappearance by the government in February and have not been seen in public since.Ethan Chen* said Li Wenliang’s death pushed him to challenge Beijing’s narrative around the disease – but he too fears he might suffer the same fate as his colleagues.“The government doesn’t want Chinese citizens to have access to information that contradicts the official narrative, so they always try to silence whistleblowers by taking them out of the picture,” Chen told The Independent.“Their disappearance reminds me that as a journalist, there are certain duties that I’m supposed to fulfil when the government tries to bury all the truth – I have the responsibility to write down what I have seen and experienced during the outbreak.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Hu Jia, a prominent Chinese activist, is no stranger to the wide range of methods that Beijing uses to oppress anyone who hopes to reveal truth during major crises.On 31 January, hours before he was scheduled to join a talk show on Radio Free Asia (RFA) to talk about the coronavirus outbreak, several police knocked on the door of Hu’s residence, asking him what he’d been up to.“Then they asked whether I’ve been accepting media interviews, and warned that I shouldn’t be stabbing the Chinese government’s back when the whole country was united to fight against the coronavirus,” Hu recalled.The argument lasted for more than half an hour, and in the end, the police warned that if Hu insisted on joining the show on RFA, that would leave them with no choice but to “follow the drill”.Then around 11 pm that night, police showed up at his door again. This time, they asked Hu to go downstairs with them. Once he went downstairs, the police got into an argument with him again.“They quarrelled with me until they made sure that I wouldn’t be able to make it for the Radio Free Asia’s talk show,” Hu said. “I brought my cellphone with me, in case producers from Radio Free Asia wanted to reach me. But the police made it really clear that if I tried to use my phone while quarrelling with them, they would use extreme measures against me.”After that evening, Hu was put under house arrest for 16 days.“I have been detained multiple times since in 2001, yet every time I was arrested for comments I made, it made me understand the reason why freedom of speech is so important to a functioning civil society,” Hu said.“Unfortunately, I also paid a huge price for defending freedom of speech. I need to sacrifice my personal freedom, dignity and safety in order to keep raising awareness.”Chinese journalists are now trying to keep the truth about the coronavirus outbreak alive by moving information shared by citizens to places beyond Beijing’s reach.Several citizen-initiated projects have been set up on GitHub and other platforms. These projects gather personal narratives and Chinese news reports about the coronavirus outbreak across different social media platforms and online forums in China.One of the projects is called “Memories of the 2020 coronavirus outbreak,” which is started by seven volunteers around the world and aims at “establishing a database for researchers studying epidemic prevention and internet users.”But rights activists warn that ultimately, it is Beijing who is winning in this tug of war.“The Chinese government has been increasingly restricting the use of VPNs by Chinese citizens, and we can expect that their moves will make circumvention over the internet censorship even harder for citizens in the future,” Wang from HRW said.“They can also just silence whoever they want by arbitrarily detaining them.”* Names have been changed to protect identityShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Our nation will never be the same again.So many features of our society will be transformed, from the way we are governed to where we work and how we entertain ourselves.The state will be far bigger and more powerful. Free enterprise will no longer flourish. Welfare dependency, even for businesses, will the new norm.Our social lives will reshape around the home, with travel firms, cinemas and restaurants feeling the burden, while key workers like our NHS heroes will replace narcissistic celebrities in our adoration.And in practice, we will live under a socialist system, where the government has effectively nationalised the entire economy.That dramatic change will be a legacy of the extraordinary measures adopted by the Treasury in the face of the coronavirus challenge.The Chancellor Rishi Sunak has recently announced a range of policies that amount to the biggest bailout in history, including a £ billion rescue package for businesses, a massive expansion in the social security system, and an unprecedented subsidy of up to  per cent for wages in the private sector.This vast intervention is on top of the Budget a fortnight ago, in which Mr Sunak announced the biggest increase in public expenditure since the s, as well as a colossal £ billion capital investment fund for infrastructure projects.Great Britain PLC has now been the subject of a takeover by the state.Mr Sunak’s phenomenal splurge is more radical than anything even Jeremy Corbyn proposed at the last election. And the clock will not be turned back.Having tasted economic control on an epic scale, Whitehall and Westminster will be reluctant to give it up.After all, the post-war socialist expansion of the state by the - Labour Government was not reversed for decades, despite long periods of Conservative rule, until Margaret Thatcher came to power in .Recent nationalisations like those of the railways and airlines will remain in place. The public sector will continue to dominate.But the new socialist Britain will be poorer and less dynamic.The services sector, which currently accounts for  per cent of the economy, will take decades to recover from the shutdown imposed by the coronavirus panic.With the collapse of so many businesses, especially in the hospitality trade and retailing, mass unemployment will cast a long shadow.At the same time, record levels of government debt will require huge levels of borrowing and higher taxation.The fall-out from the coronavirus crisis will probably also make our nation more inward-looking and less enthusiastic about globalisation.The barriers that are now going up around Europe will remain in place, while Britain is likely to impose stronger border controls.Immigration, currently running at over , new arrivals every year, is bound to plummet, especially when shrunken firms cannot claim to need cheap foreign labour.The international travel industry will continue to struggle once the crisis is over, with clients fearful of health risks.With reduced activity, it seems doubtful that the third runway at Heathrow Airport will ever be built.Ruined airlines and cruise companies will look back on pre-corona days as a golden age, though domestic tourism may receive a boost from the greater number of Brits holidaying at home.The Covid- catastrophe has exposed how fragile our inter-connected world really is.In an attempt to reduce our vulnerability, Britain is likely to become far more self-sufficient by strengthening our domestic supply lines, rebuilding our manufacturing base and bolstering the agricultural sector.Similarly, our dangerous dependence on Chinese contractors for everything from nuclear power to broadband technology will end.Future governments will be reluctant to reach the kind of deal that Boris Johnson recently did with the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to play a key role in the expansion of the G network.One key result of the Covid crackdown has been to show businesses that it is perfectly possible for a signicant number of their employees to work from home, thanks to the web.This trend is bound to gather pace even when the crisis has passed.The huge increase in home working will herald a long-term decline in the office, for so long one of the symbols of our sophisticated civilisation.And the consequences of such a change will be enormous.Commercial property, which is estimated to be worth around £ billion in Britain, will drastically fall in value.Commuting by road or rail will become far less common, leaving trains emptier and roads less congested.For the first time since rail privatisation, passenger numbers will drop signicantly.Nor will there be any justication for huge, expensive transport projects like the £ billion HS rail link or the vast proposed new £ billion Lower Thames crossing, linking Kent and Essex by road.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.In a culture dominated by home working, expensive city living will lose much of its appeal.Already overblown, property bubbles in fashionable hotspots like London and Manchester could soon burst.Yet, while the urban housing market runs into deep trouble, coastal and rural regions may well see a revival.Will Margate be the new Islington On a more profound level, the shock of the present crisis will leave us more oriented towards our homes and family le.We will be less obsessed with eating out, more focused on home entertainment. TV streaming services will grow rapidly. Cinema chains will shrink.Hardly any area of British le will be free of the covid revolution’s impact.Throughout the academic world, there will be more respect for valuable, practical subjects like science, engineering and medicine - and less for academic pursuits like media studies.In politics, there is likely to be less partisanship and more consensus, as highlighted by the remarkable praise heaped last week on Mr Sunak by the TUC for his bailout.In a shell-shocked country, trying to recover from economic meltdown and social lockdown, there won’t be much time for isive fads, poisonous identity politics or invented victimhood.Shrieking about safe spaces will sound like pathetic self-indulgence in a society where thousands are likely to have died from the Corona killer.What could be beneficial for Britain is a fundamental rethink about the values of our age.The health crisis has graphically revealed who really matters when it comes to the le-and-death crunch.As the death toll mounts, it is not the property speculators, lawyers, quango chiefs, and hedge fund managers that keep our country going, despite their vast financial rewards.It is the NHS staff, the care home workers, the retail assistants, the emergency services personnel, the lorry drivers and the shelf-stackers, many of whom have limited earnings.Perhaps in the new Britain forged by the coronavirus, we will lavish more on our carers, and less on our celebrities.Out of the current despair, we may come to recognise our real priorities.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That figure includes  per cent of Conservative voters and  per cent of Labour voters.What’s more, only two per cent of the public said they don’t intend to follow the new rules.His personal favourability rating has skyrocketed too.So how has the Prime Minister achieved the type of public support that most leaders during any era of our history could only dream of Because he made it clear he was desperate not to impose these measures.We support Boris introducing draconian rule over our lives now because it’s obvious that doing so is his worst nightmare.He started slowly, initially allowing schools to stay open and football games to still be played based on scientic advice.But as the modelling changed and the threat to le became very real, our willingness to comply dramatically increased too.Only time will tellhe did too much too soon or too little too late. However, I am prepared to say on the record that the measured response was the right one.The British public, who have been brave enough to put their lives and ideology to one side, will be horried to learn that leaders within the Labour party have tried to snf out a political opportunity here.Labour party chairman Ian Lavery has been caught by the Guido Fawkes website plotting to use the coronavirus crisis as what he disgustingly calls a “great opportunity”.He said: “By the way when something like this happens, we’re going to see lots of our own dying as a consequence. But, you know apart from that, it’s going to give the fantastic battalion of Labour Party members, community champions out there a great opportunity of showing how Labour, and why Labour, is best when it gets on the front foot and best when it gets people together. We need to make sure that we do that, and community organising what a great opportunity it’s going to give us.”How revolting.The coronavirus pandemic is not a great political opportunity, Mr Lavery.It’s an international tragedy of epic proportions that will cause grief for many and economic catastrophe for years to come.It’s caused someone I know to lose a dear relative before their time. It’s caused weddings to be cancelled, jobs to be lost and le savings to go down the drain.It’s not a “great opportunity” for anyone – and Lavery should immediately apologise for such a smear.

If you are in good health and unable to work, why not join them It has been moving beyond measure to witness the , retired or former medics, nurses and pharmacists rejoining the NHS to fight this disease.They could be safe at home.

Many are going the extra mile to help friends, neighbours and OAPs who are self-isolating.

And it is desperately urgent.As the latest heartbreaking death toll shows, this crisis is likely to get much worse before it gets better. THE eerie, deserted streets tell their own story.

It’s a rite of passage.So for all those GCSE and A-level students for whom Covid- has put paid to that “end of exams” feeling, I have nothing but the utmost sympathy.Last Wednesday I was on a dog walk with my youngestwhen news came in that her GCSEs were off.It’s tempting to think that she and the rest of Class  might have whooped with joy at this unprecedented cancellation of national exams, but that would be to sorely underestimate the level of pressure placed on their generation to get a qualication that will elevate them out of the in-tray of le and into paid employment.Like the Olympic athletes who’ve spent the past few years training for that one event in Tokyo that has been postponed until next year, our kids have been preparing for exams that their parents and teachers have drummed into them are so critically important to their future.So forgive them , despite the deaths that give perspective to the little things that many of us find frustrating about this plague on all our houses, they allow themselves a spell of feeling deeply sorry for themselves.They will now be given “predicted” grades — though the Government is still frustratingly vague on the exact detail of how they will be decided upon.There has been some suggestion that mock results might be a factor but, let’s face it, they’re rarely taken seriously at the time and never match the grades kids get in the real thing. So let’s hope they come up with something fairer.Either way, it’s going to be potentially fraught with pitfalls.“I wanted to earn my grades,” the youngest said, plaintively, the other day. “Now I feel like all my hard work has been for nothing.”I reassured her that, one day, knowledge such as “changes to Tanzania’s economy through private and foreign investment” , “the formation of polyesters through the reaction between dicarboxylic acid monomers and diol monomers”and “parallel and collinear vectors”might come in handy when, ten years from now, she’s at a pub quiz. Or maybe not.Which brings me to my final point on this unprecedented cancellation of GCSEs and A-levels.The latter are fine as they are, but perhaps those in the upper echelons of education could use this time of isolation to take a long, hard look at GCSEs and whether they are fit for purpose in the modern world Most kids know their subject strengths and weaknesses by the time they’re  so, aside from basic maths and English, which prove useful whatever your chosen employment, do they really need their heads crammed with often obscure information that,needed in later le, they could simply look up on Google Better, surely, to teach them vital le skills such as entrepreneurialism, money management, how to compose an impressive CV and do well in job interviews Like a reverse version of a minute’s silence, it’s to show our hard-working NHS staff how much we appreciate their efforts at this deeply challenging time.So whether you do it in a garden balcony windowbox or post it live on social media, put your hands together and show that we care about them too.MADONNA has posted an, er, inspirational Instagram video of herself ponticating on the Covid- plague while luxuriating in a bath full of rose petals.Her Madgeness declares: “That’s the thing about Covid-. It doesn’t care about how rich you are, how famous you are, how funny you are, how smart you are, where you live, how old you are, what amazing stories you can tell.“It’s the great equaliser and what’s terrible about it is what’s great about it.”Hmmmm. Nice sentiment, but the reality of self-isolation for the majority brings to mind the famous quote from George Orwell’s Animal Farm. “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”Be it the Queen Of Pop, with her vast mansion and multi-million dollar nest egg to see her through these trying times, or The Queen with her “skeleton staff of eight” – being in lockdown is far nicer when you’re wealthy.But when there’s loads of you in a pokey space and with no discernible means of paying next month’s rent, it’s not so “great”. GOVERNMENT advice on who should be doing what and when is still a little woolly.And where there’s potential loopholes there are those who will either misunderstand or willfully exploit them.Step forward Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley who, post-lockdown, told his staff they should turn up for work before being publicly shamed in to telling them to stay home after all.But with cycle shops being allowed to stay open, he could perhaps mitigate that as he’s in the business of sports equipment, he thought the same rule applied to his business too.­Similarly, while the building work on one house near me has ceased, another is still ongoing with at least eight construction workers – all of whom will have either shared a van or taken public transport to get there.So one suspects the Government is going to have to ramp up the “lockdown” rhetoric to make it clearer exactly what is deemed essential and what’s not.Meanwhile, I’m going to exploit this small pocket of vagueness by hopping on my bike and heading to the local pharmacy for a packet of hair dye, not least because it comes with a handy pair of disposable gloves.As the Donald Trump meme shows above, no one wants to see that much harsh reality.THE closure of McDonald’s prompted s of people to queue round the block for one last Big Mac.They shouldn’t worry.Given that a man in Utah claims to own the world’s oldest McDonald’s burgerand it shows no sign of decay.All those desperate McAddicts could have bought  of them and they’d still be edible at Christmas.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was the apex of collective euphoria in a unique football season for this club.A month has passed since that match, so the timing is pertinent.The aggregation of thousands of people, centimetres from each other, engaging in manestations of euphoria like hugging, shouting, all of that could’ve favoured viral reciprocation.I have to imagine many didn’t want to miss that gamethey had tickets, eventhey felt a slight fever.With hindsight, it was madness to play with a crowd present, but at the time things weren’t clear enough. It’d be unthinkable now.Valencia have announced  per cent of their squad and staff tested positive for coronavirus, linking it to that trip to Milan.And, so far Atalanta goalkeeper Marco Sportiello has tested positive for the deadly bug leading to the entire squad being quarantined.The area around Bergamo went into lockdown just four days after the game as the number of cases soared.Bergamo mayor Giorgio Gori has labelled the clash a “biological bomb” and says he believes it caused the spread of the virus in Europe.He is quoted in Spanish paper Marca as saying: “The match was a biological bomb. At that time we did not know what was happening.“If the virus was already circulating, the forty thousand fans who went to San Siro were infected.“No one knew that the virus was already circulating among us.“Many watched the game in groups and there were lots of contact [between fans] that night.“The virus passed from one person to another.”Prof Le Foche, who works in Rome, said it would now be unthinkable to have such an event with thousands of people attending given how contagious the virus is.He said: At the time the match was played there was still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the virus.What we didnt know was just how contagious it was but obviously today we know how quickly the virus can spread.Today it would be unthinkable to hold such a large event and thats why everything has stopped.To receive our Covid- newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What matters most is we get money to those who need it the most as quickly as we can”.Better off earners are instead judged to have nest eggs tucked away that they can delve into for short-term support.Five million Brits - almost one in six of the workforce - work for themselves.Some . million of them have already been left out of pocket by the crisis, the Resolution Foundation think-tank warned yesterday.But until the brand new system is up and running, they will be asked to go on Universal Credit.The Chancellor will also highlight how he last week hiked the job support element of the benefit to £ a week, as well as point to the series of other emergency reliefs he has put in place, including deferring VAT, mortgage holidays, scrapping business rates and free loans for businesses.Insiders also yesterday claimed the new self-employed bailout has been “incredibly dficult” to set up, and there were also serious concerns about designing a system that took away the incentive to work.Mr Johnson also told MPs yesterday that the Government will “put our arms around every worker” to help them during the unprecedented crisis.He told PMQs: “As a society and a country we’re doing a quite extraordinary thing.“For the first time in our history, to get through this crisis, we’re putting our arms as a country around every single worker, every single employee in this country.“It is a quite unprecedented step. I know there are concerns about the self-employed, but he’ll be hearing more in the next couple of days from the Chancellor.”The Chancellor last week launched an all-out bid to save millions of jobs by promising to pay  per cent of the wages of staff kept on the books.And the PM hinted today’s bailout for Britain’s five million self-employed will be on a similar scale, saying he wants “parity” of support.Mr Sunak also extended the one year business rates holiday to all firms forced to close for the coronavirus lockdown.That means estate agents, hairdressers, furniture stores, sports shops and other businesses forced to shut down for at least three weeks will pay no rates until April .It is an extension of the one-year business rates holiday handed to retailers, pubs, restaurants, leisure centres and travel agents in last week’s announcement.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was really good for social distancing.The kids seem very subdued in general at the moment… There were a few who were a bit worried about their parents, asking should they be working.With mental health having such an impact on people’s lives, we set up a worry box last year.I got a worry plaque off Amazon, where you put your hand on it and it turns red then eventually changes to green as you think of your worry.That tells the children that the fairies have taken their worry away.I never thought about it, but I caught the children in my class using it when I nipped to the toilet yesterday.They said they were using it in case anyone had got any worries about this virus. It just really touched me.One boy came over to thank me last night and give me a hug, and I had to stop him. He#s only eight and looked so hurt, but eventually said, #Oh yes, sorry Miss Woodall!#It was so cute, I nearly cried.We’ve also been doing the Joe Wicks workouts every morning – even the lady cooking the school dinners joined in.It’s things like that that’s really cheering them up. It must be so scary for them.”Dr Murray Ellender, , is a London-based GP and co-founder of eConsult.He says: “It’s been more of the same chaos.We’re getting loads of practices live with online consultations – we’ve done  practices in the last few days. This time last year, we were doing about  a month.There’s about , more patients who can now consult online.We’ve still got all the same staffing challenges and PPE is still an issue.There’s lots of government stuff saying, ‘We’re getting the protective equipment out there, it’s all fine’. But actually we’re not seeing that yet.It may be on its way, but it hasn’t arrived. We’re struggling to get hold of kit.Even the stuff GPs are being armed with is fairly inadequate.We’ve got standard masks and plastic aprons and normal gloves, whereas you’re meant to have special filter masks and proper gowns.It’s impossible to mobilise enough equipment for the whole country, but in some ways, in General Practice, you feel quite exposed to the illness.We’re examining patients with coughs, colds and sore throats. But our equipment is not adequate to be examining someone with coronavirus.Sometimes the patients come in with better protection than we’ve got!The Government are trying their best and distributing all this stuff to , practices is not easy.But the kit shortage does make it quite dficult. My we is also a GP so our house is doubling up on the risk.We do worry about it – we’ve got four children and we’re trying to keep them safe.Peter Booth, , from Leicestershire is a self-employed plumber running his family business GV Booth, with help from his -year-old dad – who manages the company’s office work.He says: “My sister Sarah’s a nurse and she rang me yesterday saying the toilet was blocked at her GP surgery in Leicester.They weren’t allowed to open without a working toilet.A drainage guy had told them they needed a plumber so my sister immediately rang me panicked.They had patients lining up outside and six or seven members of staff sat there not able to work.I went straight in and took the toilet out, but there was no issue there.We had to get an emergency drain team in again – which was a nightmare in itself – and they found it was tree roots.That’s sorted and I’m rushing back in now to re-fit the toilet so they can open up.They’ve had to talk to patients through the doors because they couldn’t let them in. They’ll have such a backlog now.When we see these people arguing over who’s a key worker and who’s not, that job today made me a key worker.It was essential to them opening.This is what I’d call a proper emergency and it means something. It’s true job satisfaction.We’re now waiting to see what the Government come out with tonight. We’re relying solely on these emergencies, so we need the help.”Shannon Summerfield, , is a support worker with not-for-profit Dimensions in Cardf. The organisation offers help to those with learning disabilities, autism, challenging behaviour and complex needs.She says: #Yesterday was a good day. One of the ladies spoke to her mum, and she got quite upset after she went because she’s so used to seeing her on a regular basis.But I think it was nice for her to hear her voice and have her mum reassure her that everything’s OK and that her mum and dad are OK.And when we do the weekly food shop for the ladies, we now have a letter and an ID card which allows us to buy multiple items because we’re doing it to support vulnerable people, eventhey’re not with us.We had been quite worried about it before.I do think it’s unfair that we’re not being tested – we should have them as well.I know there are some tests for NHS workers. But there are places that aren’t linked with the NHS where testing is still important.We don’t have testing when our staff are going off sick or for when people in our company who we support get sick.It’d be good to have more, just to be on the safe side, so we could knowthey’ve had it or not.Sam Oxley, , is a senior sous chef at Italian restaurant Forza Win, in Peckham, South London. He says: “Since the restaurant I work at shut down, I’ve tried my best to remain positive, and I know I’m lucky my wages, for the most part, will be paid.However, the reality of the situation is starting to hit.I’ll get  per cent of my pay paid hopefully, but actually, like everyone who works in hospitality, tips from customers, which are taxed and paid to me monthly, make up a large proportion of my monthly income.There’s no denying the financial impact of this pandemic is huge, for everyone.Like so many others, with no tips and a reduced wage I’m going to have to be extremely carefulI want to be able to cover my rent and bills, and obviously no one knows how long it’s going to last.However, I’m using the time I have now to create some simple, easy to follow recipe videos which I’m hoping to share online and with friends, to give others in lockdown a cooking activity to do to take their minds off things.”Kirsty Gage, , is a childminder from Kettering, Northamptonshire. She lives with partner Lewis and their -month-old son, Tommy.She says: #Today is the first time I’ve had three children since the lockdown, so I’ll have my one-year-old, a –month-old and a four-year-old all day and the seven-year-old after school.The warm weather has been a godsend. I’ve put out a little bouncy castle and we have slides, tunnels, digging activities and water so that should keep us busy for a few hours.Butthe weather changes it’s going to be much harder.Inside, we can do some painting and read some books but I’m only using the books with hard pages at the moment, not the paper ones, because I can wipe them down.The paper ones, which are better for the four-year-old and seven-year-old, are harder to keep clean so I have put them away.Because I’m having to clean everything every night I have bought loads of cleaning products recently and I’m finding out which works best.I’ll be listening to the Government announcement about self-employed workers today with interest, as it seems they aren’t going to give us help until the end of May.I don’t know how I will survive until then, £,-a-month down, unless all my bills are frozen and even then I worry that they’ll mount up and I’ll get deeper into that hole.I have outgoings for the business, like arts and crafts, which cost me at least £-a-month, nappies around £, wipes, cleaning products etc.The Government really needs to help us right now.#Raegan Drew, , is a funeral director for the Co-op Funeralcare in Edinburgh.She says: “Everyone is now sticking to the ten or under rule and the local crematorium has now removed all but ten seats, which they have placed two metres apart.One thing that has changed this week is also the closing of registrar offices, so people are being set up with remote registration.Anyone who has to register a death needs to be aware that offices aren’t open.Part of our job involved visiting hospital mortuaries to bring people into our care and, although people have been saying we might run out of morgue space, I’ve not seen any issues yet, but we’re yet to reach peak.We don’t currently need to wear extra protective equipment at the mortuaries, unless we are dealing with a suspected Covid- death.But we have our own protective equipment when dealing with any deceased anyway, in that we wear gloves at all times.Ours is a  hour business and, like all businesses, we’ve got some people self-isolating but we are lucky that we have enough staff to keep things ticking over.Katie*, , is a social worker, supporting vulnerable young adults between -, many of whom have lShe says: “It’s been reported this week that there are concerns about the impact social isolation and lockdowns will affect victims of domestic violence, and the same applies to those with mental health issues too.I’ve had a therapist call me today to say that she’s concerned about a couple in their twenties who are living together who both have severe mental health issues including bipolar disorder and depression.Being in isolation together is a bit of a nightmare – it’s not a situation you’d want to happen, especially as they’ve both discussed feeling suicidal thoughts.It’s distressing as a social worker to hear this situation is causing young people to have suicidal thoughts because they’re stuck in a house.They struggle day to day in society, and now they’re away from that, everything is heightened.We’ve had to think about what we can offer them, and give them strategies and equipping them with coping mechanisms when they’re struggling.We’ve also been trying to instil as much positivity as we can within them, so everyday we ask them to tell us something they’re thankful for.It sounds so small, but when you have challenging mental health issues, evenyou’re able to acknowledge one positive thing each day, it’s a huge achievement.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Conclusions may have to change when larger numbers of infants are reported.It comes as the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists released updated advice to pregnant women working in healthcare.The guidance emphasises that pregnant women of any gestation should be offered the choice of whether to work in direct patient-facing roles during the coronavirus pandemic.It says that women who are less than  weeks pregnant should practise social distancing but can choose to continue working in a patient-facing role, provided the necessary precautions are taken.Women who are over this stage in pregnancy, or have underlying health conditions, should avoid direct patient contact and are recommended to stay at home, they said.Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said: “The Government has taken the precautionary approach to include all pregnant women in a vulnerable group.This guidance will give pregnant healthcare workers the ability to make an informed choice about how they can continue to make an active and valuable contribution to the huge challenge facing us, whether at home or in the workplace.”Evidence, which has been based on pregnant women who have contracted other similar respiratory viruses, suggests those who contract Covid- in the third trimester are more likely to become seriously unwell.This may also lead to preterm birth of the baby, intended to enable the mother to recover through improving the efficiency of her breathing or ventilation.Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that coronavirus causes problems with the baby’s development or causes miscarriage.There is also no evidence that coronavirus can be passed from mother to baby in utero and no previous coronavirus has been shown to cause fetal abnormalities.The RCOG says that this guidance is based on limited evidence from the pandemic so far with evidence extrapolated from other similar viral illnesses.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We all stand together.What we have done I believe will stand as one of the most signicant economic interventions in the history of the British state, and by any government anywhere in the world.Cleaners, plumbers, electricians, musicians, hairdressers and other self-employed people who are eligible will be able to apply to HMRC for the taxable grant, using an online form.Rishi Sunak said his new scheme would:To qualy, more than half of their income in these periods must come from self-employment.Those who pay themselves a salary and idends through their own company are not covered by the scheme but will be covered for their salary by the Coronavirus Job Retention Schemethey are operating PAYE schemes.National Chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, Mike Cherry welcomed todays newsHe said: This bold support package from the government will give much-needed help to vast numbers of self-employed workers, guaranteeing  per cent of income to those affected, with earnings of up to £,.Many tax-paying self-employed who will be helped by today’s measures will be relieved.Although the deal is not perfect, the Government has moved a very long way today.But Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said: After days of anxious uncertainty, there are still many unanswered questions for people who are already struggling to put food on the table and look after their families.Having to wait until early June does not give self-employed people parity with those in full-time work.Andrew Sanford, partner Blick Rothernberg, warned that an extra sting for the self-employed was on the way.He said: Rishi Sunak is supporting the self-employed, but is making it clear that the perceived tax privileges they currently receive will be challenged in subsequent budgets.That is the sting in the tail for the self-employed.If youre self-employed in this sector, you may be able to get one of these.LOANSLoans of up to £ million are also on offer as part of the Chancellors business bailout package.They will be interest-free too for the first  months, with the Government coughing it up to banks.This will be done through the British Business Bank.There are  accredited lenders able to offer the scheme, including all the major banks.NO BUSINESS RATESThe one year business rates holiday has been extended to all firms forced to close due to the coronavirus lockdown.It means estate agents, hairdressers, furniture stores, sports shops and other businesses forced to shut down for at least three weeks will pay no rates until April .It is an extension of the one-year business rates holiday handed to retailers, pubs, restaurants, leisure centres and travel agents in last week’s announcement.UNIVERSAL CREDITAnyone who needs emegrency help is being urged to apply for Universal Credit.The basic allowance has been hiked to help Brits who will struggle in the next  months thanks to the crisis.You can apply online but will need a follow-up call.If you need money urgently you can ask for an advance on your first payment - but you will have to pay it back over the next year.VAT HOLIDAYThe Government will support businesses by deferring Valued Added Taxpayments for  months.NO SELF-ASSESSMENT THIS YEARIncome Tax payments due in July  under the Self-Assessment system may be deferred until January .GRANTS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES GENERALLYThe government will provide additional Small Business Grant Scheme funding for local authorities to support small businesses that already pay little or no business ratesThis will provide a one-off grant of £, to eligible businesses to help meet their ongoing business costs.This morning a damning report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that almost one million workers were working in sectors which will mostly be shut thanks to the lockdown.Almost one in fourself-employed workers were ALREADY living in relative poverty before the coronavirus crisis threatened their livelihoods, they added.Around , self-employed construction workers may lose work,they have not already, said the IFS.So far the Government have told everyone who needs emergency help to apply for Universal Credit or to claim sick pay help.Yesterday the flagship benefits scheme said it had received nearly , fresh applications for the benefit.Those with a house can also apply for a three month mortgage holiday, and renters wont be able to be evicted for the meantime either.Todays package comes a whole week after the Treasurys boss bailed out employees by pledging to pay  per cent of their wages up to £, a month to stop them being laid off.She has turned to borrowing cash from her son Joshua, , as debts which she would normally have expected to pay easily have been left unpaid.She told The Sun: “My last client was two weeks ago. I only have £ in my account and I want that to go back to my son. I reckon I can survive another three days with bills incoming.”“There’s been nothing for people like me. I pay my taxes, I declare my earnings, I try and do everything right, but I’ve had no help.”“Obviously a mum never wants to borrow cash from her son, but I have gone from a thriving business to zero in just a month.I dont feel good about it, but we need that cash for the house and he knows hell get it back as soon as I get my first job when work starts again.”She welcomed the new measures - but is still worried about cash in the short-term.She said: It doesnt really help me straight away. I want them to offer immediate assistance to people most in need. I do understand that is hard for the government to work out who that applies to but I worry what I will do for tomorrow and next week.”ELECTRICIAN and dad-of-three Darren Lawton, , is worried he won’t be able to pay his bills as his business suffers during the coronavirus shutdown. Geordie Darren, who has run North East Electricals, said:“I’ve had one job since the shutdown started. Yesterday, an elderly lady rang and her electrics had gone off.“I couldn’t leave her in the dark with no power, I felt I had to go. But then I worry about giving her the virus - so I had my hand sanitiser and I have a protective suit, overshoes and a mask.“I made her stay in the other room and kept my distance while I worked. I’ve earned just that £ since it all started.”Darren has always saved for a rainy day, but he could never have foreseen losing his own income, as well as that of his we.Darren’s we Nichola, , has also lost work and - without government help - he is fretting how to look after kids Amelie is , Dexter is , and Finlay, .He says:“My own mortgage is £ per month, council tax is £. On top of that I have all my utility bills.“I have a bit saved, but you hear it’s months we’ll be in shutdown for and I won’t last that.On the new measures announced today, he said: Its good news. I wont complain too much about it - its far better than what I thought I had last week - my main anxiety is how long it will take to come through.“I worry for others. It will take until June  I hope I can cling on till then, but I know a lot of other people need that money now. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This will also apply to cohabiting friends or family.Currently, the NHS is urging people in the UK not to leave their homesthey have a persistent cough, or a high temperature, or both, orsomebody in their family does.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Despite this, the World Health Organisationsay it is investigating the link between loss of smell and taste and Covid-.Maria Van Kerkhove, the head of the WHOs emerging diseases and zoonoses unit, said on Monday: A loss of smell or a loss of taste is something that were looking into.We are reaching out to a number of countries and looking at the cases that have already been reported to seethis is a common feature. We dont have the answer to that yet.ENT UK said viral infections are the second most common reason for people to close their sense of smell - with the most common simply being a blocked nose.It added: There is growing evidence that signicant numbers of patients with proven Covid- infection have developed anosmia hyposmia .For example, in Germany it is reported that more than two in three confirmed cases have anosmia.The organisation say they have told Public Health England about the apparent link.It comes after US scientists claimed that those with Covid- might also experience a tummy ache when they have the deadly bug.A new study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, suggests people might experience digestive issues, such as diarrhoea, when they are infected with coronavirus.Despite this revelation, people should still be vigilant in looking out for the primary symptoms of coronavirus including a dry cough and high temperature - as Covid- primarily attacks the lungs and respiratory system.Some patients may also have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose or a sore throat - but these are usually mild and begin gradually.Developing these symptoms does not necessarily mean you have the illness and they are similar to other illnesses, such as the common cold or flu.Some people will not develop all of these symptoms -  and some might not even show symptoms at all, experts say.Sir Patrick Vallance, the UKs chief scientic adviser, said: It looks quite likely that there is some degree of asymptomatic transmission.There’s definitely quite a lot of transmission very early in the disease when there are very mild symptoms.Around one out of every six who gets Covid- become seriously ill and develops dficulty breathing, according to the World Health Organisation .Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are at most risk developing serious illness.This can include pneumonia and swelling in the lungs, which can make it hard for the lungs to pass oxygen into the bloodstream - leading to organ failure and death.Severe pneumonia can kill people by causing them to drown in the fluid flooding their lungs.People with fever, cough and dficulty breathing should seek medical attention, the WHO says.The virus is believed to be transmitted between people through droplets spread from coughing and touching or shaking hands.While sneezing is not a symptom of the new coronavirus, its also thought to be a way that droplets can be spread.Symptoms are thought to appear between two and  days.New research has found that the average incubation period of Covid- is . days.A study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US found that almost allof those who develop symptoms appeared to do so within . days of infection.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The borders were closing and flights were stopping. They had to get out.“But this move was planned for some time. They realised Canada would not work out for ious reasons and they want to be based in the Los Angeles area.“They have a big support network there. It’s where their new team of Hollywood agents and PRs and business managers are based.

The film will raise money for the charity Elephants Without Borders.Our sources say the arrangement is another indication of where the couple see their priorities going forward.The royal insider explained: “For Meghan, this type of work is going to be coming out of Hollywood going forward.She feels comfortable there around her people and has projects already planned like her children’s book.”The Sussexes left the £.million mansion they were borrowing in Vancouver and took a flight out of the city shortly before US President Donald Trump and Canadian PM Justin Trudeau closed the border between their countries.The couple landed in the LA area, which includes Bel Air — the posh neighbourhood of s Will Smith sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.A signicant chunk of the guest list from their  wedding live there, including actor Idris Elba and talk show legend Oprah Winfrey.George Clooney and we Amal also have a place there — while David and Victoria Beckham own a lavish mansion in Hollywood.Meghan’s former Suits husband Patrick J Adams and actress we Troian Bellisario live in the exclusive Los Feliz neighbourhood.Popstar Nick Jonas and his film star we Priyanka Chopra have just purchased a £million mansion in the Calornian hills.Harry will also be able to spend more time with his polo-playing Argentine mucker — and Ralph Lauren model — Nacho Figueras.Andthey ever find themselves short of celebrity contacts, Late Late Show host James Corden will be able to hook them up with even more.Royal courtiers believe the decision to move full-time to the US makes a mockery of the couple’s earlier pledge that they chose Canada because they wanted to live in a Commonwealth country.One said: “We are stunned and horried.

and should anything happen they would receive excellent care in state of the art facilities.Volunteers would also have the risks fully explained to them so that they can make a decision about going forward.MPs heard yesterday that several coronavirus vaccines are being developed and could be available in six months.Prof Andrew Pollard, from Oxford University told the Commons science and technology committee that the timeline depended on trials going well and production sites being expanded.However, he admitted a timescale of  to  months was more likely.The jabs would protect high risk groups such as the sick and elderly who are currently being shielded at home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Cross-contamination is rampant. The animal cruelty is off the scale.Bears, tigers,  wolf cubs, crocodiles, hedgehogs and turtles are not spared in this notorious wildle food trade, either.Now the despicable wet markets used by some Chinese people — markets already responsible for the Sars outbreak in  — have finally brought the world to its knees.Scientists have established that it is highly likely Covid- was linked to a notorious live animal market in Wuhan.Gene sequencing analysis shows the new coronavirus probably started in bats and was transferred to humans via the scaly anteater the pangolin.So why is there so little outrage about the wet markets that we know have the potential to cause catastrophic outcomes to human health Even Donald Trump — slammed for branding Covid- the “Chinese virus” — avoided criticising the wet markets when prompted during a press conference at the White House on Wednesday.Maybe that’s because the moment someone tries to speak up they are accused of racism.That happened to reality star and retail entrepreneur Luisa Zissman earlier this week when she posted a video on Instagram of a wet market and called for them to be “banned completely”.After the usual social media outrage, she told me: “I wholeheartedly disagree with this particular part of Chinese culture, but that does not make me racist.” It should be remembered there are many campaigners within China desperately trying to get the wet markets banned too.After all, the addition of more exotic animals only dates back to the s, as the ruling communist party struggled to feed the population and million people perished in what became known as the great famine.By , the ironically named Wildle Protection Law encouraged industrial-level breeding of the likes of bears, bats and turtles to be sold through wet markets. And that’s when the viruses began to form.When the Sars crisis was linked to a wet market in southern China, officials shut it down and made wildle farming illegal. But they reversed the decision just a few months later.As of  it was a £billion industry, mainly because the rich and the powerful pay copious quantities of money to eat rare wildle as they believe  claims about their role in Chinese medicine.Now with coronavirus spreading, the government has again temporarily banned wildle trading and shut down wet markets.But it’s not permanent yet — and it must be.We already know that the early Chinese cover-up of Covid-, which makes Chernobyl look like a misdemeanour, resulted in the disease’s rapid spread.In fact,China had taken early action experts reckon the number of coronavirus cases could have been cut by  per cent, making its rampage all over the globe far less likely.The new illness was directly linked to the infamous wildle market in Wuhan on December , but it wasn’t until New Year’s Eve that the World Health Organisation was informed and the site closed.The brave Chinese doctors who tried to spread the word about Covid- were shut down by the authorities too, and early testing was stopped and samples  destroyed.I have no doubt the Chinese government has blood on its hands over coronavirus.And saying that now, at the peak of the health crisis, is not the time to tackle the issue is wrong.We must have this uncomfortable discussion while our anger is raw and the pain  all too real.To receive our Covid- newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.I DON’T have enough superlatives to describe my adoration for Lady Gaga.No pop star of her generation has been more consistently savvy, smart or, for that matter, talented.So it pains me to so deeply disagree with her decision to delay the release of her highly anticipated new album Chromatica, which was due to drop on April , in the middle of quarantine hell.In fact, I actually think the delay is quite selfish.Thanks to the technological advances in streaming, listening to new music is one of the few activities we can engage in collectively without having to leave the house. Gaga wrote that: “It just doesn’t feel right to me to release this album with all that is going on during this global pandemic.”Instead she wants us all to focus on “finding solutions”, such as providing medical equipment and school meals.All very good aims, of course.But what the world also needs now is music, sweet music, to unite us and, frankly, distract us.She’s also made a strategic error, given she had a captive audience with time on their hands at home to stream to their heart’s content.This is the time for the UK to show that, eight decades on, we still have the Blitz spirit in our blood.Many of our parents or grandparents were sent to the front line to fight Hitler.All most of us have to do is put our lives temporarily on hold while scoffing Domino’s pizza and watching Netflix.I don’t for a second underestimate the signicance of such a call, by the way.These are dark days and there is a growing coronavirus-shaped cloud over our daily lives right now, causing extreme stress and anxiety.It’s so easy to feel angry and uncertain and tearful and depressed.Like you, I’ve been through the gamut of emotions while practising social distancing.However, that is simply not an excuse not to try to  carry on with your normal lives.It won’t be for ever.

Asked why the UK would not be taking part in the scheme the PMaposs official spokesman said: Well, we are no longer members of the EU and pointed towards other efforts to secure ventilators. Pressedthe decision was related to Brexit ideology, the spokesman said: No, as I say, this is an area where weaposre making our own efforts. The government later said they hadnapost opted out because of Brexit, but because they had not received the email inviting the UK to take part. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said she was deeply shocked and concerned about the decision not to participate, saying it was a no-brainer to help the NHS by working with other nations. I wrote to the Government a week ago urging them to put pragmatism above ideological considerations and urgently opt in to the EU joint procurement scheme, she said. Now I urge them to reconsider their devastating decision to not participate. We canapost put Brexit over breathing - lives must come first. It was announced a week ago that the European Commission was organising a joint procurement of ventilators and protective equipment.

The professor suggested a Ministry of Food could be set up to ensure no one goes hungry.Have you been struggling to get what you need during the coronavirus pandemic  Email webnews@trinitymirrorItems would be paid for with ration coupons, unused school kitchens would be taken over and used to cook meals on a big scale, and food would be delivered directly to peopleaposs doors, he said. Prof Evans has suggested that the British public are not taking the disease seriously enough and that a big sht in consumption habits needs to take place soon. If things do not change quickly, stockpiling will become a real problem and rationing will become necessary.Both wars show us that what the government is doing right now - telling people not to panic buy, to voluntarily curtail consumption - just doesnapost work, sadly, he told FEMAIL.  Prof Evans argued that the Government could work with retailers in organising the system, with price controls introduced as well as penalties for racketeers. He continued: The online ration system would also seem likely since we do not want scenes like at the weekend, where hundreds of people descend on a supermarket at the same time, because this increases the risk of transmission greatly. The academic, who has written extensively on wartime eating habits, warned that UK food supplies could begin to falter as the crisis on the continent continues.  A Ministry of Food, as seen in the WWII, may need to come in oversee the food network. School kitchens could be taken over by the government, Prof Evans suggested, and food delivery networks nationalised to lessen the need for people to go outside. He added: Itaposs a huge culture sht, and government intervention could represent the end of consumerism as we know it.  For several weeks now bare shelves have become a staple of the British supermarket experience. The issue of stockpiling - which is currently causing the shelves to go empty rather than a national shortage of food - was powerfully brought to the publicaposs attention by Dawn Bilbrough.

At pm, millions across the country took part in Clap for our Carers, a movement which was a chance to say thank you to all NHS workers as Britain continues its fight against coronavirus. Prince William and Kate posted a video taken before bedtime of the three royal children applauding at once for several seconds. Little Louis, one, wearing a blue jumper and shirt, looked all grown up as he stood between his big sister, four, and brother, six. At one point he can be seen looking up at them to check he was clapping correctly. The trio were all smiles as they applauded our NHS heroes. Charlotte could also be heard having a little giggle. Did you Clap for our Carers  Share your photos and video with webnews@mirror Kensington Royal tweeted: To all the doctors, nurses, carers, GPs, pharmacists, volunteers and other NHS staff working tirelessly to help those affected by #COVID: thank you. The Royal Family Twitter account also shared a video of people at Windsor Castle clapping. And applause could be heard coming from Birkhall in Scotland. Prince Charles and Camilla, who are self isolating along clapped but apart.  The Queen said the country is enormously thankful for the commitment of all those working in science, health and the emergency and public services, as the royal family joined the Clap for Carers public display. In the message posted on the royal familyaposs official Instagram account, the Queen said: We are enormously thankful for the expertise and commitment of our scientists, medical practitioners and emergency and public services.  The post featured a video of the Earl and Countess of Wessex and their children Lady Louise Windsor and Viscount Severn, who all clapped after Edward paid tribute to workers. He said: So from all of us just a huge thank you to so many of you working on the frontline - youaposre really appreciated keep up the fantastic work. Meanwhile, Clap for our Carers saw many of us on our doorstep, balcony or window from home and took a minute to applaud all of our tremendous NHS workers, from the catering staff to GPs.  And it wasnapost just the NHS staff we thanked. Posties, milkmen and women, delivery drivers, supermarket staff and zero-hour carers, you have all played your part in keeping Britain united during the  coronavirus  pandemic. Many of you shared videos of yourselves applauding, whilst some painted their bodies blue, wore blue accessories and turned their social media backgrounds blue.  As well as the applause, sporting and entertainment venues and landmarks illuminated to a beacon of blue to say thank you. Iconic buildings including the Royal Albert Hall and Lincoln Cathedral took part, as well as the Belfast Titanic Signature Building, The National Theatre andRadio in Newcastle.  All #lightitblue venues used LED technology to create the spontaneous flash of blue on facades and screens to ensure the campaign adheres to the critical message from the British Government for people to stay at home. Gary White, who co-started the #lightitblue campaign, said: The events and entertainment industry finds itself in an unprecedented state of enforced inaction. The best thing we can do - apart from staying at home - is to use our skills and networks to say thank you to everyone who is supporting the NHS and risking their own health to help others during this pandemic. We also feel a huge sense of responsibility for the mental wellbeing of many people within our industry who, having lost their jobs, are feeling anxious and confused about the future. We believe the #lightitblue campaign, inspired by the existing #clapforourcarers initiative, will galvanise their enthusiasm and pride in a mass gesture of solidarity.  Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby said: “The NHS expresses everything that is best in what has made this country what it is. It expresses our Christian values and hopes. It expresses the values of people of faith and no faith. It is a place of hope and giving. Thank you, NHS.

Officers have been stopping people to issue strong advice and hand out information in a bid to enforce the lockdown rules. The rules, which came into force on Monday, state that you may only leave your home for four reasons. As well as medical errands, essential shopping and absolutely essential work you can leave your home once a day to exercise. Your one trip outside includes walking your dog, the government has said. Now police are making it clear that exercise has to be done close to your home - you are not allowed to drive to another location to either exercise or walk your dog. Avon and Somerset Police have been handing out information after stopping drivers at popular dog-walking spots. It reads: The government restrictions currently in place do not permit you to use your vehicle to travel to this location to exercise. Each and every one of us has been instructed to avoid all unnecessary travel.  You are entitled to exercise once daily. This should be by walking, running or cycling from your home address. You should not be driving to a location away from home to carry this out. It is unclear whether local authority rules across coastal parts of the country which ban dog walking on beaches from May will be changed to facilitate the new regulations. Avon and Somerset Police have been approached for comment. Meanwhile, North Yorkshire Police said it will use checkpoints to stop vehicles and ask driverstheir journey is essential. Officers will ask motorists where they are going, why they are going there, and reminding them of the message to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Assistant chief constable Mike Walker said: “The new and signicant restrictions announced by the Prime Minister on Monday evening spell out very clearly what each and every one of us must do to save lives. The message is clear and the warning stark. Stay at home, save lives. “These are the lives of the people we know and love. Our partners, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, children, grandparents.

They can take place next year, and deferment might just prompt a much-needed rethink about sport in society. Organised sport has developed – degenerated, in my view – into a business monster devouring everything in its path. Money is everything, from the hundreds of millions in state “funding” demanded by athletes to the multi-billion “beautul” game uglied by greed. Most sport is simply spectator commerce, watched in pubs or at home, where BT and Sky compete for the lucrative spoils of advertising and subscriptions. Worse, it is closely linked to, and hugely benefits from, the boom in problem gambling, especially among men who think it smart to bet on how many corners or saves there are. While the nation obsesses about sport, and teams, and medals, its people grow  relentlessly more obese – hardly fit to watch, much less play.

Buckingham Palace and Number  shared photos of the unusual meeting on social media, showing the PM on one end of the phone in his office and the Queen in her home at Windsor.The snap - released just hours after Clarance House announced that Prince Charles has tested positive for coronavirus - gives us an insight into the Queenaposs private part of the castle.

But look a little closer, and you can see lots of other lovely personal touches... Lots of corgis The Queen appears to have not one, but two corgi models in pride of place on her desk. One appears to be made from porcelain and shows a single brown dog.  The other shows two silver corgis sitting on a piece of slate, which has been engraved. Over the course of her  year reign, the Queen has owned more than  hounds after receiving her first corgi as a birthday present on her th birthday.

Vulcan and Candy were seen travelling to Windsor with the Queen as her car left Buckingham Palace last week. Soldiers As well as her dogs, the Queen has a number of other figurines - including two soldiers. One is wearing a traditional Army unorm, while the other appears more modern.  As Sovereign, the Queen is Head of the Armed Forces, and the majority of her family have served at some point during their lives.This includes Prince Harry, who served in the Army including two tours of Afghanistan and Prince William who was in the RAF.A rather old phone Many people on social media were quick to notice the Queenaposs rather old phone. She called Boris from a cream phone The Queen has reportedly been learning how to use Skype and FaceTime so she can carry out meetings to keep up to date with the pandemic.

The college added pregnant women’s choices on whether they work in direct patient-facing roles during the coronavirus pandemic should be respected and supported by their employers. The latest advice suggests women who are more than  weeks pregnant, or have underlying health conditions, should avoid direct patient contact and it is recommended that they stay at home.Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email webnews@mirror  There is nothing yet to suggest pregnant women are more likely to become infected than other healthy adults according to current evidence. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that coronavirus causes problems with the baby’s development or causes miscarriage. There is also no evidence that coronavirus can be passed from mother to baby in uteroand no previous coronavirus has been shown to cause fetal abnormalities. Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said: The Government has taken the precautionary approach to include all pregnant women in a vulnerable group. This guidance will give pregnant healthcare workers the ability to make an informed choice about how they can continue to make an active and valuable contribution to the huge challenge facing us, whether at home or in the workplace.” Dr Edward Morris, President of The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, added:We fully understand and empathise with the fear and anxiety faced by all healthcare professinals at this uncertain time, and particularly by staff with vulnerabilities, including pregnant healthcare professionals.Although the evidence to date available offers no evidence of harm, it is not possible to give absolute assurance to any pregnant woman that contracting coronavirus carries no risk to her baby and no risk to her over and above that experienced by a non-pregnant healthy inidual. “In light of the limited evidence, pregnant women of any gestation should be offered the choice of whether to work in direct patient-facing roles during the COVID- pandemic, and their choices should be respected and supported.”Gill Walton, Chief Executive of The Royal College of Midwives, said:“I know that many pregnant midwives and maternity support workers have been working hard supporting pregnant women while naturally being concerned for themselves."},{"url":null,"title":"you should leave your shoes","story":"NewsWhy you should leave your shoes outside your house during coronavirus pandemicCOVID- can survive on footwear for up to five days and could be picked up in heavily populated areas like supermarkets, transport and offices, infectious disease specialists have warnedShareCommentsByLila Randall:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-items-you-should-consider-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The virus could be lurking on supermarket floors, transport or airports, where hoards of people pass on a regular basis. Other heavily populated areas where footwear could pick up the virus are offices, shopping centres and gyms. For instance, it can survive on door handles and bus and train poles for up to nine days - more than four times longer than flu.Dr Mary E.Schmidt, a health advisor in Missouri, said coronavirus has been shown to live on synthetic surfaces for ‘five days or more’ via studies on materials similar to shoe fabrics at room temperature.Public health specialist Carole Winner, based in Kansas City, agreed with the finding, adding that shoes should be left in a garage on directly inside the front door to stop it spreading. The idea is to just not to track them throughout the house, she told HuffPost. The novel flu has a longer-le depending on the surfaces it is on, lasting up to four hours on copper, up to  hours on cardboard and between two to three days of plastic and stainless steel. If the coronavirus is trodden through the home, it can also survive on furniture like bedside tables, call buttons or light switches.  Professor Gunter Kampf, the lead author into the study at Greswald University Hospital in northern Germany, said: In hospitals these can be door handles, for example, but also call buttons, bedside tables, bed frames and other objects in the direct vicinity of patients, which are often made of metal or plastic. Low temperature and high air humidity further increase their lespan, Professor Kampf added.The news comes as prime minister Boris Johnson introduces tougher measures on social distancing in a bid to protect the NHS and curb the number of cases in the UK .The number of cases has jumped to ,, while  people have died.

In the supermarkets a lot of the fruit and veg we buy is sold loose, this means that people are able to pick and choose which piece looks the best. However, this also means that the chances of picking up a piece of fruit that someone has already picked up once, before deciding they didnapost want, is extremely high. Timothy Newsome, a Virologist at the University of Sydney, said that every surface has a hazard” - including your food. However he adds that “you cannot get risk down to zero.Speaking to news.au he explained: It should be recognised the virus can survive on many surfaces quite stably, sometimes for a number of days.But really, the only surface it really doesn’t like is copper, which is not very useful in our day-to-day le.

Nothing concrete, though, and I want to prove my fitness first before doing anything.“If the season gets extended, that might end up being a good thing for me.“There might even be time for me to play for somebody this season depending on what happens. That would be great for my fitness before heading into pre-season.”Despite the impact the coronavirus has had on le back in Scotland, Murray and his family are planning to head back to Dundee in the coming weeks with his time at Wits coming to an end.In South Africa, the virus hasn’t yet had the same effect as in Europe and the football season was only shut down last week.He admits there are worries but being back home and closer to family and friends is a draw for Murray as he plots the next move of a career that has seen him turn out for Montrose, Downfield, Tayport, Dundee Violet, Arbroath, United, Hibs and then the Dark Blues before heading for Johannesburg.CALUM WOODGER: It#s a perfect storm and, make no doubts about it, Dundee and Dundee United are right in the eye of it\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-fc-dundee-united-spfl-shutdown embed # secretlKqPsPpAv\" data-secret\"lKqPsPpAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He added: “There haven’t been any deaths so it is all just starting here, to be honest.“I think countries like this have learned from the ones who got it first so President Cyril Ramaphosa here is putting measures in place for prevention, hand sanitiser everywhere and things like that.“I get UK TV so I’ve been hearing all the stuff from home, get to see Boris every night, and it is worrying.“Having lived in South Africa, you are isolated at the best of times anyway so that won’t be as much a problem for people here.“You never walk anywhere for safety reasons – don’t get me wrong, it’s a great place but you have to be careful.”Murray has loved his time in South Africa but says he’s looking forward to getting back home.“I’ve missed Scottish football in some ways, not others I suppose,” he added.“The football is good over here but there’s not the passion in the stands like in Scotland.“It’s a dferent culture.

Do you keep the players ticking over on their own or rest “The most important thing, though, is the health of everybody – as a club we are doing everything to look after our players and our staff, that’s paramount.“There’s not many times when I’ll say football isn’t important but it isn’t right now.”The Dundee players have been given inidual training programmes to work on at home but, with government advice to stay indoors as much as possible, it’s not easy for some.“As a club we have set up inidual programmes for the players but the trouble with that is a lot of the work is on treadmills or exercise bikes and not everyone has access to them,” added the Dens boss.“Otherwise you’re asking them to go out and do bits in the park and the advice is now not really to do that.

Bottom of the second tier got £,.Could they not pay out the minimum to everybody right now and decide the rest later Welcome to lockdown everybody!

and families who cannot leave their homes to access essential goods.To make sure Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire remains fed they are appealing to people to donate food and household essentials.All four charities are appealing for tinned meals, rice, pasta, cleaning products, soap, washing power and toilet tissues.They can be handed to the charity at Sainsbury’s at Berryden, Asda at Middleton Park and the Tesco stores at Wellington Road and in Westhill. vw, px\"  Craig Walker, editor of the Evening Express, said: “This is an unprecedented event and the demands on charities are also

remembering there are a network of food banks working at a local level that also deserve help and anything anyone can do to assist them is very important.”During the campaign the Evening Express will also be publicising the work being done by ACU and the people it’s helping.Martin Ingram, Original ’s programmer controller, said: “I’d like to encourage everyone to think about others in the north-east who are having to cope with a lack of money, a lack of mobility or any other dficulty.“There are many vulnerable people who find it hard enough getting by even without Covid  – and so

grateful to the Evening Express and Original  in highlighting the needs of vulnerable people in Aberdeen and the surrounding area.“For many who don’t have family around them, a home they can call their own or a safe place to isolate, it is vital they are able to receive help in meeting their critical needs.“ACU has been a rapid and collective response to Aberdeen City Council’s call to ‘Feed the City’, ensuring the most vulnerable are protected by our shared efforts.”Aberdeen Cyrenians is co-ordinating and delivering supplies to those in need as well as cooking, making up the packages and contributing food stocks.Social Bite is providing packed lunches to include in the parcels and CFINE is continuing to supply additional food through the FareShare network.Aberdeen Foyer is supporting efforts from their Summer Street hub.Josh Littlejohn, founder of Social Bite, said working alongside other organisations in the city at this time makes perfect sense.He said: “It is brilliant to see these charities in Aberdeen working together.“As part of the national response we are giving out , food packs in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow.“We have handed out  of them in Aberdeen already and we

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo. Unfortunately, his van broke down and while waiting for the mechanic the monkeys began to get restless.Then another van driver called Archie pulled up and askedhe could help.ldquoIrsquom late for my delivery. If I give you pound, will you take these monkeys to the zoo  asked George.ldquoSure, said Archie.So Archie took the monkeys away in his van.George waited for the mechanic and finally his van was repaired. He then set off for the zoo to make sure the monkeys were delivered successfully.But to his surprise, he saw Archie walking along the street with the monkeys!George called out to him: ldquoWhat are you doing  I gave you pound to take the monkeys to the zoo!Archie called back: ldquoI did, but we got a group discount, I have some money left, so now Irsquom taking them to the cinema!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-residents-urged-keep-helping-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"The foodbank, based in Tranent, provides food parcels to vulnerable members of the community.Candace Higgins, foodbank director, said the situation was changing ldquohour by hour, adding: ldquoWe are still operating as normal but certain protocols have been put in place when delivering food parcels.Volunteers making deliveries are now simply knocking on doors or ringing bells, rather than waiting for doors to be opened to them.

This includes people over , as well as people with underlying conditions that could make the symptoms of coronavirus worse.Unfortunately for these people, self-isolation means not leaving your house - making going walks outside or meeting friends an impossibility. But the government does say people who are self-isolating can keep windows open to get fresh air.Whatrsquos social distancing The government is advising everyone who is not currently self-isolating to still practise social distancing.This means not meeting with friends and family, staying away from crowded areas, avoiding all non-essential travel, and working from home where possible.Luckily for these people, there is no restriction on going for walks outside. The government website actually encourages people to get plenty of exercise and fresh air.ldquoAt times like these, the website reads, ldquoit can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse.\"Its only warning is not to get too close to other people when outside, asking walkers to stay at least two metres away from each other.Coronavirus: the facts by the World Health Organisation and the NHSWhat is coronavirus COVID- is a respiratory illness that can affect lungs and airways. It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.What caused coronavirus The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.How is it spread As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.What precautions can be taken Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.Government adviceAs of Monday, March , the government advised that everyone should be observing social distancing - avoiding unnecessary travel and working from home where possible. Anyone with a cough or cold symptoms now needs to self-isolate with their entire household for  days.The over s or anyone who is vulnerable or living with an underlying illness are being asked to be extra careful and stay at home to self-isolate.For more information on government advice, please check their website.Should I avoid public places The advice now is to avoid public places and any non-essential travel. Travel abroad is also being advised against for the next  days at least, and many European countries have closed their borders.What should I doI feel unwell Donrsquot go to your GP but instead call NHS  or look online at the coronavirus service that can tell youyou need medical help and what to do next.When to call NHS NHS  should be usedyou feel unwell with coronavirus symptoms, have been in a country with a high risk of coronavirus in the last  days oryou have been in close contact with someone with the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-take-20-000-new-staff","story":"Tesco has become the latest supermarket to announce plans to recruit new staff to cope with the coronavirus outbreak overwhelming stores.The UKrsquos biggest grocer said it will recruit , temporary workers for at least the next  weeks.Its recruitment drive was launched on Wednesday, adding ldquosince then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores.Some staff are being interviewed, processed and working within the same day, Tesco added.Tescorsquos HR chief, Natasha Adams, said: ldquoIrsquom so proud to be welcoming thousands of new colleagues to Tesco.

Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness.

Children of elderly parents, and some who havenrsquot yet reached retirement age, were imploring, begging, and in some cases emotionally blackmailing them to heed medical advice and stay behind doors.My husband, who is -plus on the outside but at heart still at Newport when Dylan went electric, also came under fire. Hersquod made the mistake of mentioning to his daughter that he had taken a minibus to get groceries. Compared to the -year-old who leapt on a bus to the Buchanan Galleries and bought a piano ahead of the lockdown, hersquod been ultra-cautious. Instead of catching the bus home, he had ed on foot over the hills, his backpack stuffed with goodies.His daughter knew better than to tackle him directly, so texted me instead. ldquoTell her not to worry, he replied. As reassurance goes, it lacked a certain rigour. How often have teenagers told their mum or dad ldquonot to worry when they were neglecting their homework, or spending the small hours who knows where, doing who knows what  Did that lower their blood pressure one iota Up and down the country, the tables have been turned. If this were the era of switchboards, operators could tap into millions of lines and hear the increasingly anxious voices of the middle-aged trying to get their stubborn and defensive old ones to see sense.The problem is, the over-seventies are exceptionally proud of retaining their independence. They bridle at any hint of being past it or not capable of looking after themselves. In normal circumstances this is a healthy mindset, fending off the reality of advancing years and the worry of one day becoming a burden. How many magazine features have you read reporting that  is the new , and weightlting and running are essential to stave off premature rigor mortis  Until the past fortnight, all those who remember rationingand were carrying on asthey were mere striplings were viewed as marvels and inspirations. Now, their gung-ho, can-do spirit has to be put on hold, forced into hibernation for however long this blight lasts. I donrsquot envy any son or daughter reminding their mother or father of their vulnerability, and urging them to take seriously the mortal threat that lies beyond the gate.To see children laying down the law is yet another example of a world gone bananas. You could call it pay-back. Did any of us manage to get through adolescence without coming under constant sniper attack  Most parents griped and girned until their hair turned grey. In our household you could set the clock by the raised voices chivvying us to get out to school, or turn down the radio, or help with the washing up. The small print of parent-child contracts includes the adultrsquos right to scold, ponticate and nag as often as required. Juniorrsquos side of the bargain makes no provision for reasoned argument, protest or rebellion. It states simply that they must unquestioningly obey, preferably for all time.The irony of policing onersquos parents behaviour doesnrsquot make this any easier. But perhaps therersquos a frisson of satisfaction in being able to exact revenge on those who spent the best years of their lives hectoring and carping. Could it feel like a righting of old wrongs to chastise dad for his recklessness, or ask a -year-old to grow up when she suggests an SAS-style dawn-raid on the supermarket It is especially satisfying, surely, that the role reversal necessary to reinforce these new rules is done in the name of commonsense and caring. When the point of the exercise is to protect the lives of those you love, in terms of moral high ground itrsquos up there with Macchu Pichu. What possible riposte can anyone give when urged to take precautions not just to safeguard yourself, but those closest to you Yet as most handbooks to raising a family suggest, nagging is futile. It sets up a vicious circle of resentment and rebellion, and makes the one being chastised feel sore. When people are lectured, they switch off, mentally reaching for the headphones until the tone of voice improves. Whether yoursquore  or , that never changes. So, as a mass technological revolution is rolled-out, with elderly luddites being all but forcibly initiated into the art of video calling, more trouble lies ahead.In an old-fashioned phone conversation, finger-wagging offspring canrsquot see their loved ones rolling their eyes, putting an invisible gun to their temples, or mouthing ldquoGive me a break!.

Theyrsquoll see these beloved faces taking on an unfamiliar juvenile expression: sullen irritation, avoidance of eye contact, nail-biting, fidgeting, a huffily shrugged shoulder.The longer these virus vigilantes bang on, the less response theyrsquoll get. The age-old aria between adult and adolescent is an unequal contest: a torrent of words in one corner, mutinous monosyllables in the other. I donrsquot doubt for a moment that most older folk will pay heed to their familyrsquos concerns.

The Chancellor is expected to unveil his new measures at the daily Downing St briefing.During a less populated and less pugnacious Prime Ministerrsquos Questions than usual, Mr Johnson referred to ldquoparity of support for the self-employed, who include an estimated , people living and working in Scotland.He stressed there were ldquoparticular complexities about how to help them, which needed to be addressed.\"They are not all in the same position and all I can say is that we are working as fast as we possibly can to get the appropriate package of support for everybody in this country,\" explained the PM.Earlier, during Scottish Questions, Alister Jack, the Scottish Secretary, revealed the Chancellor had been looking at many schemes ldquoacross the EU and around the world to see how best to help the self-employed.During PMQs, Mr Johnson insisted the Government would do ldquoabsolutely everything it takes to beat the virus and get the country through to the other side, telling MPs: ldquoAs a society and as a country we are doing a quite extraordinary thing for the first time in our history to get through this crisis, we are putting out arms as a country around every single worker, every single employeehellipand it is a quite unprecedented step.Later at the daily Downing St press conference, he referred to how ldquonever in our history has the Government put its arms around people in the way we are doing now to help them get through this dficult time.In the Commons, Ian Blackford for the SNP called for the Government to support all the countryrsquos workers and told the PM: ldquoHe said the UK is putting its arms around all our workers, I hope that that will become the case because as of today, its not.\"This morning, the Resolution Foundation estimated that one in three people in self-employment, a total of .m workers, are now at risk of losing their income. In Scotland, that means , self-employed people are deeply concerned about the jobs and the families they support.\"The Highland MP emphasised how opposition parties wanted to work with the Government on the issue of help for the self-employed but he said there was ldquofrustration because weve gone into lockdown and workers are without income this is an emergency\".He continued: \"As we stand here, people are losing their incomes. Telling them to wait another day simply isnt good enough.\"Mr Blackford asked: \"Can the Prime Minster confirm that when the Chancellor eventually does announce measures, there will be parity and equality of support between the already announced jobs retention scheme and the new scheme for the self-employed  They must not be left behind Prime Minister.\"Mr Johnson said the SNP leader was making a very important point and declared: ldquoI totally share his desire to get parity of support.\"But, again, he pointed out: \"There are particular dficulties with those who are not on PAYE schemes ashellipthe whole House understands. We are bringing forward a package to ensure that everybody gets the support that they need.\"Jeremy Corbyn, appearing at his last PMQs as Labour leader, also raised the issue of the self-employed in relation to construction workers and pointed out how building sites were \"still operating, still working on non-emergency work despite the new rules\" as he referenced a radio call from a self-employed construction worker who said he had contracted coronavirus but had \"no other option but to get on the London tube and go onto a site to work\".He urged: \"Can the PM be absolutely clear and give unequivocal guidance now that construction work on non-emergency work should stop now \"In response, Mr Johnson said: \"Everybody should work at home unless they must go to work\", adding: \"If a...construction company is continuing, then clearly they should do so in accordance with the guidance of Public Health England.\"The PM stressed: \"But what were not doing, and this is fully in accordance with the scientic and medical advice, what were not doing is closing down the whole UK economy.\""},{"url":null,"title":"andy-maciver-thankful-true-leaders-stepping-plate","story":"A lot of these experts lurk on Twitter, sometimes using their own names and sometimes not, but always available to tell us why either Boris Johnson or Nicola Sturgeonare appallingly mismanaging the Coronavirus pandemic and putting us all at risk.Fortunately, my Twitter timeline is not real le. Although it can be challenging to retain a sense of perspective on this, the people using the coronavirus to advance partisan politics constitute a small proportion of the population.Indeed, in an unexpected triumph for the mainstream media, the coronavirus outbreak could precipitate a setback for the world of blogs, user-created and socially-shared news, which has shown itself to be partisan, hysterical and, at worst, highly dangerous in its rank inaccuracy.The broadsheet newspapers, in particular, and broadcast news, have excelled themselves. In Scotland, I would highlight this newspaper, The Herald, along with the Scotsman, the Times, the Courier and the Press  Journal as exemplars of good content, good contributors and good tone. STVrsquos Scotland Tonight has been excellent, and it is a great pity that the impact of the virus is forcing it to go weekly rather than nightly, from tonight onwards. And the BBC, despite the mix of UK and Scottish content being confusing when the UK Government and Scottish Government erge, is doing a signicantly better job of managing the range of views on Coronavirus than it has on other dominant issues such as Brexit.What most of the mainstream media has successfully portrayed is what the world of blogs and social media cannot see because of their blinding bias: that Scotland has two leaders in Mr Johnson and Ms Sturgeon who, although of dfering styles, are both of high intelligence and high analytical ability, and who have shown themselves able to be both decisive and nimble in the most dramatic circumstances.Those who read the last paragraph and roll their eyes are, Irsquom afraid, the people who can open their eyes but cannot see. YouGov has polled regularly since the start of the crisis, showing high approval ratings both for Mr Johnson and the UK Governmentrsquos actions, and I am certain that Scottish polling would reveal the same in favour of Ms Sturgeon.Mr Johnson and Ms Sturgeon are in the midst of a once-in-a-century crisis. Ms Sturgeon said, at the outset of this pandemic, that she has ldquonever cared less about party politics, and I have no doubt that this genuine sentiment is shared by Mr Johnson. It is impossible to understand both the scale of their challenge and the burden placed on them as the iniduals at the top of the tree. Iniduals, let us remember, who are not just leaders, but people. People with parents in the at-risk group, withrelatives in the NHS, and witha pregnant fiancee.Although they will both be emotionally and physically exhausted, we as citizens expect them to be able to make lucid decisions about an existential issue which will shape the rest of our lives. Yes, they have ministers, advisers and experts around them, but as the people in the office history will pass sentence on them as iniduals. Not since Sir Winston Churchill have we had a leader in this country whose decisions will be judged by generations to come.There is a fine line between respecting and assisting a crisis government, and failing to speak upit takes the wrong course. Sense-checking is an essential part of this process. The announcement last night by the parliament of New Zealand, that the legislative programme has been suspended and a special committee has been formed under the chairmanship of the leader of the opposition, with a majority of members from the opposition, is a fascinating attempt at bipartisan scrutiny of what is, in effect, a wartime government.The New Zealand model could, I think, work well in Scotland, where Jackson Carlaw is displaying his own outstanding leadership credentials by ensuring that the First Minister knows he has her back, and thathe does develop any concerns he will deal with them in the right way.Indeed, Mr Carlawrsquos letter on Tuesday to his Conservative colleague in the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, shows that he is just as prepared to raise an issue of concernwith a Tory as he is with a Nationalist.The truth is that the great majority of the people who make it their business to criticise Mr Johnson or Ms Sturgeon couldnrsquot lace their boots. They do so through spectacles tinted by their political bias. Furthermore, it is one-dimensional criticism which takes no account of the plethora of factors they have to consider.Behavioural science doesnrsquot work, critics say, we should have had a lockdown weeks ago, like in China. But a lockdown in a dictatorship, where non-compliance could lead to a long jail term, or worse, is dferent from a lockdown in a free society. Chinese lives may be saved now, but what has been the cost in human le of the Communist regime Madrid built a field hospital weeks ago, yet Matt Hancock only announced our first one on Tuesday. Wersquore miles behind, right  Wrong. Of course countries in Europe took some steps first the virus reached there signicantly earlier than here. Indeed, there is good reason to believe that the UK, and Scotland, are ahead of our continental neighbours at this point in the curve.The irony of all of this is that those who seek to use the coronavirus to launch politicised criticism at our leaders are actually criticising the Governmentrsquos medical, scientic and behavioural experts. For it is their advice which has shaped Mr Johnson and Ms Sturgeonrsquos strategy all along.As the modelling changes, so does the advice, and so does the strategy. That is precisely what should happen. This is not about politics. This is about government. Soyou have something useful to say, then speak.

And it came in a seemingly unimportant way.

These programmes are the beating heart of liberal America. Both play before live audiences ndash but not last week. The hosts told their jokes to empty, silent studios. Vibrant, energy-packed stand-up felt hollow, deadened, humourless. And then both shows announced they were going off air.Little spots of light in our culture keep going dark. British TV dramas stopped filming. Release dates for movies were delayed, even the latest James Bond, titled ndash with awful serendipity ndash No Time To Die. Bond may seem inconsequential ndash and, indeed, in the great scheme of things a spy film is utterly meaningless ndash but the mothballing of one of the biggest global entertainment franchises shows just how much Coronavirus has silenced culture.Some will rightly say: therersquos plenty of existing culture to keep us occupied ndash lots of books and films and music. Thatrsquos true, but itrsquos not the point. Thatrsquos not what culture is for. Culture isnrsquot there just to keep you distracted. Culture is also meant to reflect the world wersquore living in, to express the human spirit right here and right now. When culture stops, that canrsquot happen. And eventually, even Netflix will run out of stockpiled programmes. Culture ndash in the shape of books, films and songs ndash is finite.

Herersquos what we know: Alex Salmond was accused of sexual assault and attempted rape and the jury ed not guilty verdicts on  of the sexual assault charges, including one of attempted rape, and ruled not proven on a charge of sexual assault with intent to rape. Herersquos what we donrsquot know: the identities of the women who accused him.That cannot be fair. Historically, the process of investigation, prosecution, and defence has been guided by a balance between complainants and the accused. But in recent years the balance has come under strain and we know why: the Savile scandal led to a principle that ldquoall victims should be believed and protected. And ldquoprotected meant anonymity whatever happens.Accused people, as wersquove seen, do not have similar rights, and the consequences can be horrendous. Read Harvey Proctorrsquos memoir Credible and Trueyou want to know more. The former MP was one of the targets of Scotland Yardrsquos investigation into claims of a paedophile ring. The claims were untrue but Mr Proctorrsquos reputation was traduced and trashed. Wersquove seen the same with Mr Salmond.The answer is anonymity for accused people in all cases where the accuser has anonymity. Both parties should have the right to identy themselvesthey want to, but they should not have the right to identy the other party. In fact, we should go further: it should be a criminal offence for a complainant to reveal the identity of the accused. Cases like Mr Salmondrsquos add to the pressure for such a change to happen and, in the end, I think it will.A change along those lines would be good for all of us for a simple reason: it would restore the historical balance between the two parties and protect citizens no matter which side of a court case theyrsquore on. And itrsquos based on a simple principle of fairness and equality: it wasnrsquot fair that Mr Salmondrsquos name was made public while the names of his accusers werenrsquot and the unfairness was darkly underlined by the fact that the jury did not believe the accusers.The same changes should be made to the quasi-judicial processes in workplaces because the same problems occur. Any member of staff accused of impropriety should know the facts, the people involved, they should be given a proper chance to defend themselves, and the investigation should be impartial. The Scottish Government failed on all of those counts and I fear other workplaces would too for the same reason ndash ldquoall victims should be believed and protected.Irsquom not asking you to feel sorry for Alex Salmond here ndash all Irsquom saying is that making our procedures fairer would be good for all of us. Irsquom also hoping the end of the trial might signal a bit of re-tuning in politics too. There were some who hoped the court case would damage the SNP, and it may still do sothe fall-out lands on the First Minister. But the private travails of Mr Salmond are unlikely to change many minds on the issue of how we govern Scotland, and quite right too. My hope now is we can stick to the point.Much more interesting is what Mr Salmond, the politician, does next. We know the SNP is ided, but because of the trial the Salmond camp hasnrsquot been able to marshal itself yet. The verdict changes that and Irsquom intrigued, and a bit worried, about where that will take us, because I remember . Unionists sat back and said ldquosupport for independence is in the s, itrsquos fine. A few months later they sat up and said ldquosupport for independence is in the high s! What are we going to do , and it was largely Alex Salmond who did that.Despite everything thatrsquos happened, I think Mr Salmond still has that capacity to inject kineticism, risk and wrath into the debate. If he targets it at the SNP in the short term, itrsquoll be nasty, but in the longer termhe and his allies regain control of the independence cause, we shouldnrsquot underestimate the effect it could have.

We need to get an accurate picture from health boards of what people have and what people need.

Mail is still scheduled to be collected and delivered as normal.#This is a fast-moving situation and local service levels may at times be impacted by local absences.#Mr O’Riordain explained that Royal Mail takes the health and safety of its colleagues, its customers and the local communities in which it operates very seriously.#From today we have introduced a range of new social distancing measures aimed at offering further protection for our colleagues,# he said.#Standard ways of working are being revised to ensure that, wherever possible, colleagues stay two metres apart. We are implementing a new rule that means there will only be one person in a Royal Mail delivery vehicle at any one time.#Processes have been further reviewed to minimise the passing of work between colleagues. And we are calling for the washing of hands when colleagues enter and leave Royal Mail buildings, as well as at regular times during the day.#In order to protect further both staff and customers, Royal Mail has said it will not be handing over hand-held devices to customers to capture signatures during signed deliveries. Postal workers will instead log the name of the person accepting the item, and can sign on their behalf.The managing director added: #For all customerswhere we need to deliver any parcel that won’t fit through their letterbox, we will place their item at their door.#Having knocked on the door, we will then step aside to a safe distance while they retrieve their item. This will ensure the item is delivered securely rather than being left outside.“If they are unable to come to the door at all we will issue a #something for you# card, advising of other ways they can arrange to get their item.#For example, by getting a friend or family member to collect the parcel from our local customer service point on their behalf. In this situation, and to keep their mail as secure as possible, they will need to bring along the card we left and a form of ID in the name of the person the item is addressed to.#In line with guidance from the UK#s chief medical officer and public health authorities, Royal Mail is also advising colleagues that good hand hygiene is the first and most important line of defence.“We continue to act on public health authority advice which is updated daily,#  explained Mr O’Riordain.#In the meantime we share regular updates and information with colleagues. We have also adopted enhanced disinfectant cleaning of communal areas in all Royal Mail sites on a daily basis. We are monitoring the situation closely.“Public health authorities have advised people receiving parcels are not at risk of contracting coronavirus. From experience with other coronaviruses, we know that these types of viruses don’t survive long on objects, such as letters or parcels. This complements the highly publicised guidance from public health authorities for people to wash their hands more often than usual using soap and hot water.“These actions form part of a package of measures being taken by Royal Mail to protect both its customers and its colleagues”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

What is alarming is how little challenge there has been to our government#s decision to take a dferent path from that recommended by the World Health Organisation . Shetland, Scotland and the UK is out of synch with almost everywhere  in how we are trying to tackle this coronavirus. We are not #following the science#, as ‘experts’ and politicians of ious colours frequently suggest. The scientic community is itself ided over this issue and we are following a particular reading of the science.WHO’s consistent advice has been to test, track and trace every suspected case of coronavirus. The overwhelming majority of countries are taking this approach. The UK Scientic Advisory Group For Emergencies , the body advising our politicians, do not believe we can contain the virus using the WHO#s methodology, so our government has allowed the virus to spread, while attempting to control itin a manner that doesn#t put excessive pressure on the NHS at any particular point during the outbreak.My opinion is worth little on this matter # but the fact the UK is taking a dferent approach concerns me, given the WHO#s history in dealing with virus outbreaks such as this. What disturbs me is the apparent lack of awareness about UK exceptionalism on this issue. We must come together to overcome this problem but people will only buy into a collective effortthey have at least a basic understanding of what we are trying to do and why. #We know best # trust us# will not do. Scrutiny, questions and critique are vital when there is still much to learn and so much is at stake. You are not an idiot. Please don#t let name calling, or whatever, put you off getting better informed about this most crucial of matters.At last count  out of the  countries that presently exist have recorded cases#.How do you know who is taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done or how those governments rhetoric dfers from the actual reality  We have much ignorance and  information in the media, and as always the headless-chicken doom-merchants tell fake tails of doom. Only yesterday a self-ordained fitness person Facebooked about a boy trapped with the corpse of his sister for three days. The actual truth no otherwise healthy child has died worldwide of Covid, not one ever. The boy was a man, the sister was  and died of status epilepticus! Just what possesses people to peddle such tripe is beyond comprehension, but the online media is awash with it.I don#t think anybody knows which governments are taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done by every one of them or how their rhetoric dfers from the actual reality. I certainly don#t know and never claimed I did. I said the majority of countries are adopting the WHO approach, successfully or otherwise.I appreciateisn#t gospel and apologiseyou, or anybody , has evidence contrary to what they have stated.Time will tell whether this alternative approach has been for better or worse.Ian T # South Korea has followed WHO guidelines, testing more people per capita than anywhere , and the number of new cases there has dropped drastically.The country recorded  new cases of Covid- yesterday, compared with a peak of  cases on February th.I understand there is every chance the virus will spread again in South Koreaonce social contact restrictions are lted, but at the very least their efforts to contain the spread has bought them more time.More time to make sure their NHS and other essential services are prepared as well as possible. More time to acquire testing capability. More time to shield those most at risk from the virus as best as possible.You claim the WHO approach has been unsuccessful. South Korea adopted it and has had more success fighting this virus than anywhere .I appreciate what works in one country may not work where. What concerns me is our governmentshave paid little heed to the likes of South Korea and taken a path at odds with almost everywhere .A failure to adequately explain why has induced panic as much as anything . Now the UK resources are going into the new antibody test. That tells us who is immune, a far far more useful thing to know.You said earlier in this thread: #We have much ignorance and  information in the media.# I suggest you focus on getting your facts right before you start bashingor the press at large. Unless of course you have abandoned the truth and decided to take the path of the most habitual of liars Donald Trump  In which case I#d have more success debating this issuewith a brick!Now stop panicking and do like me. I have volunteered to come out of retirement and rejoin the NHS. I am qualied to help and will do so without questionI can. Now just stop your moaning, spreading of alarmist criticism and postulating about something you know little. Nothing is much worse than raising fear and alarm when one is not remotely qualied so to do.Ian T # I#d advise you to crawl out of your own behind, but you appear so far up it any effort to to do so would likely be futile. I#ll leave it for others to read this discussion and decide who knows what between us.With the government shutting down Parliament, and effective scrutiny of its actions, yesterdaythere is no prospect of outside pressure changing their course at the moment. Everybody#s time, is therefore, best spent dealing with the practicalities of the situation we face for now.Your offer to come out of retirement to help the health service is commendable and I wish you all the best with that. It was inspirational to see over half a million people sign up yesterday to volunteer with the NHS.I remain sceptical about the path our government is on with this coronavirus but the likes of these NHS volunteers give me hope. I urge everybody to follow their lead and do whatever they can to look after themselves, those around them and other people in general during these challenging times.Good to see your motivations are political rather like the newspaper you keep quoting from. If you believe what you babble on about Parliament Shutting down rational argument is pointless. Try not to be too frightened and really understand a little science and use some common sense.For heaven#s sake Helen, we have gone beyond our capacity to trace, let alone test. Whatever did you write your PhD thesis in, headlesschikenology or alarmistscarmongology !Faroes which have fixed links between the islands have  times as many cases as Shetland. May just be coincidence but i would have thought that fixed links help spread disease more quickly.Yes Ian, a car in a tunnel does go a little bit faster than a ferry. So the spread by fixed link will perhaps be accelerated by a few minutes. Now, what probably makes more sense is that Faroe has a population of , rather more than  times that of Shetland., proportionally per head of population,Faroe, fixed links and all is doing rather better than us!!!Ian T.I think you may have accidently hit an extra  there # The current population of the Faroe Islands is c. , Ian, Faroe had a population of , as of June  . Unlike Shetland they are almost certainly testing for Covid- more widely in the community, so it is not possible to directly compare our current figure of  hospital tested cases to their .Whoops, no. I gave the population of Faro!! Portugal!!! Dyslexia rules OK!!!!Just to state the obvious. If you are afraid for yourself,relatives and loved ones. All you have to do is stay inside your house. It is as simple as that.This Virus can not get to youyou do that simple thing. It is not rocket science!!!Yes it can, via an envelope retrieved from a mailbox, groceries and any other items brought into your home that have been handled by other people.There are some strategies you may employ to minimize risk of contamination.Wear disposable gloves when retrieving mail, disinfect the mail before bringing it into your house.Junk mail should go directly from the mailbox to the bin. Retrieve mail only every two to three days to minimize exposure.As to groceries, avoid fresh produce.Wear disposable gloves when shopping.Only buy canned or frozen items and sanitize them before putting into storage.Ideally, buy enough that you can rotate the stock.Use only grocery items, canned or frozen that have been in your possession for  days or more.On the other handyou literally stay in your house and not opened the door to anyone or thing, for the next month or two, or three, or four# the virus probably will not be able to get to you.

More centres will open in the coming days, with at least one Covid- centre in each Trust area.Minister Swann said: “Primary Care Covid- Centres are an essential part of the fight against this virus. To ensure vital GP services can be maintained throughout the coming weeks and months, it is absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with non Covid- related conditions. “Covid- centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of having Covid- and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to these centres without being referred by their GP or Out of Hours provider.“Whilst the centres will help to free up GP services to deal with the Covid- pandemic, it is vital we balance this with the need for primary care services to continue with the minimum of disruption.”Patients attending these centres will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.Dr Tom Black, Chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland, is among the GPs working at the new Primary Care Covid- Centre at Altnagelvin. He said: “GPs have organised themselves very quickly and there has been a huge amount of work done between the Department of Health, the Health and Social Care Board, Trusts and GP Federations to provide the community with these Covid- centres.“This method of GPs working in the middle ground is vital to protect hospital services for patients with the greatest need. I have no doubt that this work will save lives.”Concluding, the Health Minister said: “I want to pay tribute to the vision, rapid action and commitment shown by our primary care doctors. Without hesitation, they have risen to meet this unprecedented challenge. On behalf of everyone in our community I want to thank them for the hugely important work they are doing.“We must all now do our part to support these healthcare professionals in the fight to stop the spread of this virus.

We watched as petrol bombs were made on a makefht production line and stored behind the barricade at the top of Ramoan Gardens. Young as we were, we knew that this was an epoch-making time.My most vivid memory from those franticfew days in August is of Patcheye Doyle standing on the roof of a Morris  which was caving in under his weight. His one eye dancing, he was roaring at a gathering of local men, urging them to get organised before the next onslaught. A fearsome and fearless scrapper of some reknown, Patcheye took the lead while others dithered. He was a hard man, in a time when that epithet was more than a throwaway schoolyard taunt.And of course, there was real fear abroad. There were no weapons to hold off an invasion, no police force to turn to for protection.And yet, the people did pull together defences, after a fashion. Barricades went up, British Army ‘ex-servies’ patrolled the streets and the people turned to each other for support and comfort.Mistakes were made too in the maelstrom. Some concerned matters of le and death, others were less consequential but remain with me: I remember the proud pine trees on the Glen Road being cut down to block the road. You can still seethe gaps where they once stood – and where their more fortunate cousins continue to watch over us.And, yet,we survived. Not in one piece, admittedly. But we emerged on the other side. Changed for sure, stronger undoubtedly but also scarred.And so what I can retrieve from thoseall-but forgotten memories of the heady days of August ’ to help us as we march headlong into this coming Cornavirus hurricane  Well, put up the barricades. Protect your neighbour.

It took her mother Annie Mary, and schoolgirl Bridie spent two years in a fever hospital along with her three younger siblings.#The coronavirus actually reminds me of those days and we had the same emphasis on hygiene,# she said. #On the buses there were ads reading #coughs and sneezes breed diseases#. You were told to cough into a handkerchief # there were no tissues in those days.#It was wild # thousands of people died of TB. When the war was over everything was closed like now, but there were plenty of dances and it spread like wildfire. Up the street a whole family of maybe five or six was completely wiped out. It was worse in the city and the streets around here were full of it.#It became known as the Galloping Consumption because it it spread so quickly and you lost weight. There was rationing right up to  so food wasn#t plentul and the houses were small so it spread easily.#But some people thought it was a saints# disease because saints died of it including the Little Flower Sister Theresa who died when she was only . I remember one old woman saying to me: #I#d be gladI had it#.#But it wasn#t long before the disease struck the McKeown household in Clondara Street.#In May or June  my mother took a cold and we finally had to call the doctor, a Dr Ryan, whose brother had been on the prison boat with my father. He said to her: #I#ll put you somewhere where you#ll rest# and they took us all in. We must have all have had TB.#Aged , Bridie was sent to Whiteabbey Hospital, where there was a school for the children. #I was in bed the night the bombs fell,# she said talking about the Belfast Blitz. #The nurse ran into the ward and said #we#ve got everybody but forgot about you, and your sister in the cot beside you!##A lot of the bombs fell into the sea outside and I thought the noise was like the sheets blowing in the wind on Dr Walker#s line # maybe that was the swish of the planes for all I know.#She added: #My brother Anthony was sent home to die when he was just seven # damn the dying did he do # he#s still alive!#She said people were terried of getting TB. #I remember one woman in the street who talked to my mother in an air shelter telling her thatpeople find out she had TB they will cast it up to her and her kids forever.#When I got out of hospital I had one year left to do at St Kevin#s and my teacher Mrs Rocks wasn#t there anymore. I always came first and got presents from her and I wondered why she wasn#t there, but she had got married and had to leave teaching, as that was the rule in those days.#People had a good idea where you had been but no one said a word.#Her mother was to spend nine years being treated in ious hospitals before she died on June   in Musgrave Park. #We were all fit and healthy. She was a country woman and we were reared in the Bog Meadows. But it made no dference # we all got TB.#I remember on Christmas  when I was  or  I came in and she was lying on the settee # she had signed herself out of hospital and got a taxi home for Christmas. But she started coughing and had to go back to the fever hospital and the whole house was disinfected again.#The cure came around  and people were being treated in Belvoir Hospital which was a fever hospital. But my mother was moved to the Nissan huts at Musgrave and the doctor took me to the side and told me that the cure came too late for her as her two lungs were gone.

There will be many people in our community who will be hurting in the weeks and months ahead. Many will be self-isolating. Many will be anxious. Some will be experiencing financial distress. We want to be there for them - to help them and support them.A similar scheme is also operating in the Donaghmore and Castlecaulfield parishes in Co Tyrone, operated by parish priest Fr David Moore, Rev Peter Thompson from the Church of Ireland and Presbyterian minister Mark Dodds.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Chaos, drama, excitement, panic and a few laughs all rolled into one.The whole disappointment of not being able to hold the wedding in April and the failed attempts to move the date forward made it look like it wasn#t supposed to happen for us right now.We wanted a church wedding. The vows before God were the most important thing for both of us. In the end, had it not been for the advice of our limo driver, Brian McCauley from First Choice Limousine and Wedding Hire, none of this would have happened.He had  bookings cancelled in a single day and called me on Tuesday morning to seewe#d got any new arrangements. He told us to call the local council and seethey could do anything and he#d be ready. That kick started everything into gear.The lady I was speaking to at the council to was very sympathetic and said her own daughter had also cancelled her wedding, but when I said we had all the papers we needed to get married in church next Saturday, only for that to have been cancelled, she told me she#d phone me back. I told her #no bother# and said a little prayer. Whatever happened would be meant to happen and I would accept that.She called back a few minutes later and said all we needed was the go-ahead from the council office. And we now had it. The only problem was we only had until midnight to do it!That#s when we had to spring into action. I had a dress that hadn#t actually been bought for the wedding but it looked right. There was a rush to get suits collected as the shops were closing and didn#t know when they#d be open again. One shop had to re-open quickly to get my shoes sorted. It was a mad day and by .pm I was on my way to St Columba#s Church, Long Tower in Derry in the back of Brian#s wedding car!As Rosemarie rushed around in Dungiven, emergency medical technician Sean had issues of his own to deal with.I was on a  call when Rosemarie tried to phone me. I saw three missed calls and though it might be a bit urgent.It was. She told me we were getting married that night! Still in the middle of his working day, he contacted Ambulance Control and spoke to duty manager Alan McAuley, who#s romantic side got the better of him as he immediately agreed to Sean finishing his sht early.They let me home at pm, said Sean. There was a bit of a cheer from the ones I work with when they knew what was happening. I dashed off home, got showered, got my son Sean Og ready and flew up to Glenshane to the chapel.There was no walking down the aisle for Rosemarie though.We all had to go in separately, she said. Just a few of us, one by one, then we stood apart as the social distancing advice tells us. But we did move closer together to exchange rings, and Sean did kiss the bride.It was important to us as a couple to have a church wedding. As practising Catholics it#s what we wanted, and we have to thank everyone who helped on Tuesday in such a mad rush.The couple#s #reception# was back on her parents# farm near Dungiven, where they were treated to a fry-up.We couldn#t have wished for anything better as a first meal as a married couple, said Rosemarie.I#m from a big family, said Sean. Rosemarie#s an only child but there are  of us Lynns, so we#ll look at having a big party when all this coronavirus business is over.Rosemarie will have a few days to get used to being Mrs Lynn and having a husband around the house.

They thought the embassy might be able to get them shelter or repatriated back home.They came out with leaflets with phone numbers which we#ve all been trying to ring for days but are just left on hold for hours and hours. The Irish Embassy itself was actually closed and there was no one to speak to. Lots of people here have no family support.We don#t know how long this is going to last so they#re all living day by day, not eating or drinking.I#m really worried about the people here, especially the mental health of young people.Dr McGourty does have a flight booked home for this weekend, but this isn#t an option for many travellers who are saving their money.I#m not worried about myself, he said. If anything happened to my family and I can#t be there for them, that would be the worst thing possible.Sinn Fein#s West Belfast MP Paul Maskey has added to the calls for both governments to repatriate citizens.With increased flight restrictions and flight cancellations, citizens are finding it increasingly dficult tohome, he said.Mr Maskey said he welcomed new guidelines from the Republic#s government which helped  peoplehome to Dublin yesterday, including around  doctors. These guidelines include the establishment of a register that will be used to advise Irish citizens ing home and alternative flight arrangements, he said.I would encourage citizens to both read and follow these guidelines. But both the Irish and British governments must do much more and take a more proactive approach to assisting citizens. This is a time of great fear and anxiety for families as Covid- continues to spread, the additional burden of being stranded abroad should not be placed on them.In Peru, hundreds of people have said they fear being stuck for months after two reported cases of Covid- in a hostel saw  tourists placed into quarantine. Many say they face a race against time as hostels are due to close by the end of March.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the first Government-charted flight from Peru arrived back in the UK yesterday.He added he was working urgently with Peruvian authorities to deliver more flights.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Police will have the power to disperse public gatherings and issue fines, however it is unclear how officers will monitor whether people are breaking the rules, what action will then be taken, and how much the fines will be.Environmental Health and Trading Standards officers will enforce the rules regarding businesses. Those found to be breaking the rules can be subject to prohibition notices and potentially unlimited fines.Q. How long will the restrictions be in place for A. The restrictions will be in place for at least three weeks, at which time they will be reviewed. At this stage they could be relaxed or tightened.Many have speculated that the restrictions will be in force for longer than three weeks, such as First Minister Arlene Foster.“If I was a betting person, I would say it would continue long after three weeks. It is right we review what are quite draconian measures. But I would imagine it will last longer than three weeks,” she said.Belfast Related ContentVideoCoronavirusCoronavirus: It#s for the best, says Foster as she welcomes Prime Minister#s move to place UK on lockdownArlene Foster has welcomed Boris Johnson#s announcement of draconian new restrictions on everyday le in a bid to tackle the spread of coronavirus.Lindy McDowellOpinionLindy McDowell:Enormity of coronavirus crisis we face is laid bare on day of raw emotion in the AssemblyThese are the choices we are going to have to deal with...

So we are trying to keep a bit of academic work going and teach them as much as we can, but have as much fun as we can.“We are hopefully going to instigate a few chores, that is easier said than done.”Pete also called for anyone who has come up with a good homeschooling technique to share it with him and he’ll share it on air.“At this stage, it’s all about trying to help each other out in whatever way we possibly can.”Belfast author and playwright Leesa Harker is also at the helm of the home classroom with her two daughters Lolaand Lexi .Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseLeesa Harker FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappLeesa HarkerLeesa loves learning, andanything, she thinks it will be her children asking her for a break.

They will need some sort of timetable and structure throughout the day.It’s also important that they have time for rest and family le, time to maybe go outside and it’s very important that they#re not overloaded with work.As a teacher, I’m going to make sure that my classes have got work in little chunks and that the teaching will continue in the amount of time that they would usually have at school.Be flexibleYou have to be flexible with the amount of time that children spend doing school work. Some households will maybe have three or four children using one computer, so it’s important that it’s broken up into easy chunks. There are so many dferent things that can children can do. They can read a book, they can do things about the house, get some exercise outside, but it is important that they keep focused and do the lessons that teachers are setting online.Use time off school wiselyWe can use this time as an opportunity. It’s important for family time. It’s maybe important that children know how to cook, or that they do a bit of exercise. There’s so many things parents can do - it’s not just about the school work.#Use all available resourcesBBC Bitesize is brilliant for Key Stage  and Key Stage . There’s also so many things available through the library service librariesni.org.uk where you can download so many books.Many schools already have resources online through the Fronter service, through My-School, through Google Drive and through homework apps. This is a time of opportunity. There are many companies putting things online for children to access for free which you can find on Google.Don#t put too much pressure on yourselfI think we have to be realistic. The school year is usually about  weeks long, so the next few weeks will be very challenging but that’s a very small amount of the entire year, so it’s just important that we can keep the children focused on as much work as they can.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It kicked off that morning, when an acquaintance texted into a WhatsApp group I am in, one with about  members. It was one of those messages we were all plagued by for the first few days of this thing, before peoplecopped themselves on.  This one was from an anonymous doctor , urging people to take ious measures. Most of it was about children. The vectors. Towards the end it got to the grandparents and how they could not be expected to babysit. There followed some discussion in the group over how important this was. Hence my rage. I am a self-employed single mother, supporting my child, and a home, I ranted to the ious friends I rang to talk me out of texting into the group itself, something I knew I would ultimately regret. My parents do not babysit. What they do is so much more. They are helping us to rear our daughter. They mind her to an extent that allows me to earn a living. If I was paying an actual childminder, working probably wouldn#t be worth my while financially. More than that, though: while her father and I co-parent amicably, co-parenting is entirely dferent to having a spouse. You don#t sit on the couch after bedtime with a co-parent and confide your small anxieties over your child#s welfare. Neither do you go to Ikea or the DIY store together of a Saturday because your child needs a new bed or something in your house needs fixing.I do these things with my parents - my daughter#s grandparents.I#m lucky. I#m so supported that sometimes I feel like a fraud calling myself a single parent. In any given week, my parents will be involved in school drop-offs and collections, in bringing my five-year-old to after-school activities hosting playdates, cooking meals, tracking down suddenly needed new sizes of clothing, and doing bedtime. They live five minutes away my daughter sees them almost every day. Three years ago, my parents got me through my separation, and made it okay to be a single parent, because I never really felt like one, so supported was I. What going through a orce taught me was that you can lose the person you had built a le with, without whom le seemed unimaginable, but that there are still some people in your le who are givens. What the last week has so shockingly revealed is that sometimes the decision to be there, in your le supporting you, might be out of their hands. Suddenly, we were facing into weeks, maybe months, of isolation from them. My father has asthma, so I knew immediately, before the WhatsApp groups cranked into action, that we would need to isolate from them. I was raging, because I was so scared. Everyone going through this has their own particular challenges. I work from home already, so that hasn#t been too much of an adjustment. So far, unlike many of my fellow freelance friends who have, terryingly, seen months of work disappear overnight, I#m busy.But it#s a strange kind of isolation to face into this as the only adult in your house. And the worries we are all facing can feel that bit more intense: finance, isolation, working from home when the children are there. Some single parents will face isolation from their children, for who knows how long. The first few days were fine. I realised quite quickly that I had to be strict with myself. Monitor exactly what I was consuming. In ways, it was freeing: muting WhatsApp groups which threw up links to doom and gloom not getting back to anything but the absolutely essential stuff. When my marriage ended I learned that for a time, when you#re in the midst of huge change and lots of grief, you need to make your world really small. You go off social media at times when you are mentally vulnerable you take things day by day, hour by houryou need. Having a child to focus on gives you a purpose, takes you out of your own mind and the potential vortex of anxiety that awaits there, threatening to pull you under. As the days went on in this past week, I noticed mental buoyancy becoming harder. I didn#t suffer the vicious anxiety I saw paralysing a lot of my friends. More a heavy sadness, like the waves of grief. We#ve had to isolate from my daughter#s father we don#t know when he#ll next see her. The sight of her one night putting her little arms around the phone during their video call and saying cuddle  nearly broke me. Like lots of us, she#s having vivid dreams each night, which she recounts to me every morning. I dreamt granddad collected me for school, she says, and I have to hide my face in the press, pretending to be looking for something so she won#t see the tears in my eyes. I miss granddad, she says a few days in and gets upset. As kids do, five minutes later she appears to have moved on entirely. But I begin to notice an increase in mentions of physical complaints, a regular sore tummy. I find that the time I#m most bothered by the social isolation is when I least want to talk to other people. Friends call and I ignore them, or text saying bad day, won#t risk crying in front of her, speak tomorrow. We video-call my parents and I stay just out of sight of the camera so they can#t see me welling up. When my daughter sees my father she howls grrrraandaaaaad, and I can barely hold it together. The panic comes in waves: when my mother texts late at night to check in when my daughter goes silent and stares into the middle distance. Alright Beanie  I ask her. I miss Daddy, and everyone, she replies. I tell myself, you know how to do this - you#ve been through this before. When your marriage ends, all sense of the future you had imagined disappears and for a time instead the future becomes a scary place. Who knows what it will bring  But I know what that is. Future thinking. Worrying about things yet to come, which may never happen, things you cannot control. By worrying about the future, you risk overwhelming yourself in the present. Stay right here in this moment, I tell myself strictly. Tidy a room. Paint with your daughter. Give her a bath. It#s not all bad, though. As with everything, there is a flip-side. Obviously, adult conversation would be good. But there is something to be said for the company of a joyful five-year-old who isn#t consumed with anxiety. It can be helpful that the face you spend all day looking at isn#t tinged with panic. But then when you get consumed by fear, for her, for yourself, for your family, your work, there#s no one to bounce it off. Not having someone to carry the fear I have and being the only one to carry it for my son… another single mother confides. The nights are the worst. Throughout this first week, I#ve been making regular trips to the kitchen to cry, before heading back in to pretend all is fine.People are lovely. We have a WhatsApp dinner party with my best friend and her family, where the children eat pasta and shout at each other. My cousin and my aunt drop off book parcels for my daughter. I contact the Department of Health to enquire as to the safety of two single parents joining forces. It#s really a case of iniduals now weighing up all the pros and cons of doing something like this against the public health advice of good hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, social distancing, keeping surfaces clean etc. Is everyone currently well  Does anybody have underlying conditions  Has anyone been in contact with a suspected or confirmed case  Is there sufficient space in the house  Answers to these types of questions will help people judge whether the advantages outweigh the risk.It sounds like a yes. Frolo, the networking app for single parents, is facilitating virtual meet-ups, group messaging for members, and providing financial advice.The WhatsApping calms down, but I find I need to still be careful. All that posting of routines online. It#s helpful, I suppose, but dficultyour reality is trying to maintain a full-time career, with no one to take the parenting sht while you work. Do they think all mothers are at home, not working through this  asks one single mother with three children who have been sent home with huge amounts of school work. Mine is five, and I have made an executive decision that she will be fine, whatever amount we do or do not get done. But it#s dficult for single parents with older children. The TV goes on far more regularly than I would like, but I decide to quell the guilt. One morning, on deadline, I look up to realise that she is on her second viewing of her favourite movie that day. She#s figured out the remote. I#m practising an extreme form of #whatever works# parenting, I tell a friend. Suspend your normal rules and rituals around screen time, because you#ve got to do what you#ve got to do. These are not normal times. The normal rules and routines do not apply, Joanna Fortune, psychotherapist and author of  Minute Parenting, tells me.I think single parents are actually better equipped than most to deal with this, one single mother tells me. I for one am used to being trapped indoors when the milk runs out three kids under nine means I can#t leave the house. I am used to online shopping, managing alone. We are better at multi-tasking, better at handling considerable anxiety due to personal struggles. Better at doing everything with kids in tow. I don#t allow my brain to go to what- places.I know what she means. Sometimes, as I#m in the kitchen making yet another snack, a flash of the mind-bogglingly daunting nature of what lies ahead sweeps over me. It might be just the two of us, for months. It was my network that got me through the dficulty of the last few years, when my marriage fell apart and now we are cut off from them.But even though this feels incredibly dficult, and draining, I also know for a fact that there is no way I will go under. I#m exhausted, and frazzled, and crying on and off , but I know also that I am in no danger of succumbing to anxiety over this. I don#t worryabout what I cannot control. In short, I can manage my mind. That is because my friend is right. Single parents have developed a mental hardiness that at a time like now stands to us. A resilience. Another mother confides that she has been sick for the past week, she thinks it is the coronavirus, and she is solo parenting. Are you okay  I ask. She replies that she has parented alone through vomiting flu, so she can handle anything.If you have survived a long relationship falling apart, you#ve had to get on, in the face of it all going to pieces. You#ve had to get up every morning and make it all okay for your children. You#ve coped with work and children overlapping. And even with all the family and friends in the world, you#ve also had to do it by yourself to some extent. You#ve woken up at four in the morning worried over something and comforted yourself back to equanimity. You#ve watched your le as you knew it fall apart and you#ve picked up the pieces and put it all back together. You#ve seen the le you wanted for your children crumble, and had to cope with that, and make it alright for them. It#s dferent, and much scarier, right now, but in ways it is the same. If you are a single parent, chances are you have already proved to yourself you can cope. You have shown your children that you can. It#s incredibly hard right now, and the future is daunting. But you are so much stronger than you might think.Liadan Hynes#s first book, How to Fall Apart, about putting your le back together after the end of a marriage, is published on May .

We will work with all of those involved to enable as many people as possible to be buried or cremated in the usual way.However, we must also safeguard public health. In the event that the virus hits Northern Ireland very hard, then we have seen where in the world that this gives rise to challenges which we are working to meet.We currently have some additional space in temporary resting places for the deceased over and above the normal arrangements. We are actively seeking to increase that capacity and are working closely with a range of organisations to find the best solution.As part of that work, a request has been submitted for the use of the soon to be decommissioned Kinnegar site near Belfast to be used as the NI Temporary Resting Place, in the event that it is needed.Earlier in the week, DoJ officials told a Stormont committee there was likely to come a point where it would be impossible to adhere to the current practice of holding funerals within three days of a death.As well as an increase in death rate due to the disease, sickness among funeral directors and council staff is anticipated to put added pressure on the system.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Emergency department at Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry to close, claims Jim WellsCoronavirus: Cancer patient whose case reduced Michelle O’Neill to tears to receive treatmentPolice investigating East Belfast UVF arrest man after £k found in carMan said he had Covid- and then coughed over police officers, Belfast court told Drop NI infrastructure projects like A until we#re in stronger shape financially, urges MLA,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was included as a commitment under the Fresh Start Agreement in , with a budget allocation of £m over the four years to -.Mr Lunn said costs will inevitably risethe project is allowed to go ahead. He continued: Due to legal challenges and public enquiries, since , no substantial construction work has been possible, but £.m has been expended, of which approximately £m has gone to consultants, the remainder to land acquisition, ground investigation, legal fees etc.Bearing in mind that every court decision since  has been, in full or in part, favourable to the objectors, more challenges and delay seems inevitable and also inevitable is the cost increases caused by delay.The current estimate,work was able to begin is around £bn for the three sections with an contribution from the Republic of Ireland, which would have to be renegotiated, of £m. There has been a -year delay in commencement with more delay and cost inflation almost certain. The estimated cost overrun is now about £m.SDLP West Tyrone MLA Daniel McCrossan said halting the A project would not solve the financial impact of tackling coronavirus. He said: Of course all necessary resources should be directed towards health and in bolstering our health service.All focus now needs to be directed towards tackling this pandemic but cutting a major infrastructure project such as the A is not the answer. The money that will be spent on the A is a drop in the ocean given the overall Stormont spend.If cutting capital projects was the direction of travel, you could look at the Belfast Transport Hub, the North South Belfast Glider or the Yorkgate interchange projects. They are all costing millions equally.Mr McCrossan said the A, when completed, would prove invaluable to boosting Northern Ireland#s future economy.He added: My support for the A remains unfettered. It is an essential project and will be even more important economically for the North West during the recovery process of this pandemic. We also have no rail services here and we#ve suffered generations of infrastructure neglect.This is a time for politicians to work together, this is not and should not be about anything other than saving lives.

Following British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s shutdown announcement on Monday, the public’s movements have been restricted which has dramatically changed the outlook in the Creggan area and beyond. People have lost jobs, been forced to self-isolate and cut themselves off from wider society. A home delivery service run from Rath Mor Centre has become very popular. Coupled with the distribution of food parcels, it has proven to be a leline for people experiencing financial hardship. The Rath Mor Centre, run by Creggan Enterprises, is a multi-purpose community facility comprising of retail services, a business centre and community services googletag.cmd.push Popular businesses including the hair salon, cafeacute and florists have been forced to close their doors resulting in the temporary, and potentially permanent, loss of - jobs. The loss of jobs will have a ‘major impact’ on the Creggan, Brandywell and Bogside area, Rath Mor Chief Executive Conal McFeely said. What remains at the centre is the supermarket, taxi company, pharmacy, post office and newly opened health centre to provide key services for the community. A unique partnership between Creggan Enterprises, Creggan Neighbourhood PartnershipEurospar and Glassagh Taxis has allowed them to run an effective delivery service across the city. googletag.cmd.push Those in need fall into two categories: people who can afford to pay for it and a sizeable section of the community who are ‘struggling to survive’. Forced isolation of already vulnerable iniduals means that some are struggling to manage mental health dficulties and are feeling ‘suicidal’. Phoning for food delivery and meeting the driver may be their only form of contact all day. “At this point in time we have a social enterprise delivering a service to not only Creggan, the Bogside and Brandywell but to Galliagh, Strathfoyle and so forth. And what we’re actually showing is the people of Creggan care about the people in this city. “This is a great example of how a community responds in a time of crisis to meet the common good. “It shows how the Creggan community comes to the fore at times of adversity to meet the needs of local people and show that we’re all in this together. “This is about saving lives and giving people hope at the other end of it.” Below:Mark McClearyawaiting his next round of deliveries – kitted in full Personal Protective Equipment .  EARTH ANGELS Community workers, Shauna Deery and Tony O’Doherty, of CNP are well placed to identy those most in need. James McClean and his we Erin have donated thousands of pounds worth of goods and other figures from the community have made additional contributions. Yesterday, local bakeries which had to shut gted a large supply of eggs. These acts of generosity have allowed CNP to make up parcels filled with essentials for volunteers to distribute accordingly. Ms Derry explained: “We were offered a huge amount of food from James McClean and following on from that we were able to identy older vulnerable people living within the Creggan are in particular, but also throughout the town to send these packages to. “Over  parcels have been sent out. We would go up to their front door, knock, leave the package on their doorstep and stand outside their fence to have a wee chat with them. “Because a huge part of the problem is social isolation for people who don’t have a family. They’re not seeing a being bar us coming to their door. We’re primarily delivering necessities like cereal, cleaning stuff, pasta, beans, peas and tinned foods. “We had a huge amount of baby stuff go out because people were struggling to access baby formula, nappies, wipes and so on.” Volunteers have answered the phone to people weeping. One family had a week old baby and were sent home from hospital, their sister had cancer and mother who is also ‘very vulnerable’ was looking after the both of them. CNP was happy to be able to support this family which was isolated and in desperate need. Other people have been visibly upset when parcels arrived at the door, thankful that someone had thought about them. Ms Deery said community workers were taken aback after receiving messages hailing them as ‘earth angels’ - which shows the depth of gratitude for their efforts. She envisages that demand for such services will increase as time goes by but more people have been coming forward with donations.

A network of new Primary Care COVID- Centres is being rapidly established to manage the growth of coronavirus cases in the community. As of :am on Wednesday March , testing has resulted in  new positive cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Northern Ireland to . To date, seven people who tested positive have sadly died. A newly published surveillance report by the Public Health Agency provides a breakdown of confirmed cases by district area. It revealed that Derry and Strabane has between  and  confirmed cases of COVID- at present while Belfast has the highest with - cases. googletag.cmd.push The latest information for the south of Ireland, as of yesterday evening, showed that there have now been seven COVID- related deaths and , confirmed cases. Speaking to the Derry News after completing his first sht at Altnagelvin’s COVID- Centre, local doctor Paul Molloy wished to stress that it is not a virus testing centre. He said the rise in cases is less than expected - but still bad - which reflects the exceptional social isolation skills being shown. The local GP praised the Derry public for their efforts and urged them to ‘keep it up’. Dr Molloy advised: “Please do not ring looking for a test or asking your GP. The only people that will be tested are people being admitted to hospital and they will be low numbers hopefully. googletag.cmd.push “There will be a large increase in tests available soon. The priority will be very sick patients, those admitted with possible virus, healthcare workers so we can maintain a workforce and then nursing home patients. “If you are in the community with flu but overall are well just use the isolation measures and keep yourself hydrated and symptom free.” He added: “I repeat there will not be testing for people in the community routinely. “The set-up is very, very safe for patients and staff. We were all shown how to put on and off the protective equipment. “Once your GP decides you need to go to the centre - the out of hours in Altnagelvin - the GP contacts them and an appointment time is given. Then you put on a mask when you arrive, a nurse takes your temperature, pulse etc and a doctor sees you. “You will probably get a treatment and go home. Very sick people will be assessed by the medical team. You may still be sent home or kept on ward  or . “The vast majoritypeople phoning your GP will just be given a treatment by the GP and not sent to the COVID centre. “Some people might go by ambulance to the Emergency Department. Children who are lower risk from this virus will be assessed in paediatrics.” RAPID ACTION Visiting Derry’s COVID- centre, Health Minister Robin Swann explained that more centres will open in the coming days, with at least one COVID- centre in each Trust area. Minister Swann said: “Primary Care COVID- Centres are an essential part of the fight against this virus. To ensure vital GP services can be maintained throughout the coming weeks and months, it is absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with non COVID- related conditions. Patients will not be able to report directly to these centres without being referred by their GP or Out of Hours provider. “Whilst the centres will help to free up GP services to deal with the COVID- pandemic, it is vital we balance this with the need for primary care services to continue with the minimum of disruption.” Patients attending these centres will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital. Dr Tom Black, Chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland, is among the GPs working at the new Primary Care COVID- Centre at Altnagelvin. He said: “GPs have organised themselves very quickly and there has been a huge amount of work done between the Department of Health, the Health and Social Care Board, Trusts and GP Federations to provide the community with these Covid- centres. “This method of GPs working in the middle ground is vital to protect hospital services for patients with the greatest need. I have no doubt that this work will save lives.” Concluding, the Health Minister said: “I want to pay tribute to the vision, rapid action and commitment shown by our primary care doctors. Without hesitation, they have risen to meet this unprecedented challenge. On behalf of everyone in our community I want to thank them for the hugely important work they are doing. “We must all now do our part to support these healthcare professionals in the fight to stop the spread of this virus. The message is clear - stay home, protect yourself and protect others so that the Health Service can protect us all.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

For many older people in the city going to church is a pivotal part of their daily routine and may be the only time they get to socialise with friends. The essential lockdown announced by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week put a stop to all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals. He did however add that ‘places of worship should remain open for solitary prayer’. googletag.cmd.push Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown said the first priority of the Catholic Church is the people who are worried, lonely, feeling abandoned and people whose timetable has been turned upside down. “We’re looking for ways to reach people with materials that are going to be fulfilling to them. How can we help people who are in a very dferent situation than the one they were in a month ago,” he explained. There was a sense in the community that coronavirus hadn’t reached Northern Ireland yet, he said, and when it did people would ‘hunker down’ but the stark Westminster warning made it clear that ‘unless we clamp down now it will hit us in the not too distant future’. googletag.cmd.push Bishop McKeown said that some people have been of the opinion that churches were never closed before and shouldn’t be told to by the state now. “But I think we’re all clear in churches across Europe that bringing people together in groups on a regular basis for extended periods of time is deadly.” During Lent St Eugene’s Cathedral would have  people through the doors every day for daily Mass and , every weekend so the adjustment has been dficult for many. The Bishop was also conscious that priests themselves are used to providing services for people and they need support at this time in finding new ways of ministering after decades of ministering in one way. Four daily Masses are being live streamed, a series reflecting on the stained-glass windows have been posted online, interesting stories and Anne Marie Hickey sang one afternoon. “It’s a challenging time for everybody, in secular society and in church society, but what really is encouraging is that there has been such a huge uptake on webcam and Facebook streaming services.”  WEBCAM  Mass and a range of other devotions take place throughout the day from .am until .pm. For example, on Monday there were , hours of watching the webcam which accounted for , views and over , sessions of more than five minutes. The bulk of these viewers would be UK and Ireland based while others tuned in from the United States, South Africa, Malaysia, Peru and where. An Instagram page has also been set-up to engage with young people in the city. “People want to see the familiar, they could follow Mass at the Vatican or New York but want the reassurance of a local voice and it is helping people in their time of fear, recognising that things are going to get a lot worse before they get better,” Bishop McKeown concluded. CHALLENGING  Father Michael Canny of the Waterside Parish said that when the gravity of the coronavirus became apparent that his own parishioners, who would be in the older age bracket, found it hard to break away from their routine. “As time progressed and the penny dropped, most realised that they were in a very vulnerable category and I think that even before isolation was enforced a lot of them had been in lockdown to look after their own health. “They found it strange at the start and talked about not having masses but when the enormity of the situation dawned on them they very, very quickly took precautionary measures. “But I think they will find the latest regulations very challenging because before they could come out for a while and sit apart from other people.” The parish webcam has become more popular during the coronavirus outbreak but Father Canny said that people prefer to attend when they can to receive Holy Communion. “I understand that, they’ve lived through terrible times in the Troubles, some of them through the War times but they have never been deprived of going to Mass. It’s very, very strange.” Around - people would be watching Mass online but he believes church is all about community and once the current crisis passes he would like to see people coming together to celebrate Mass again. “There’s no substitute for actually coming out and meeting each other face to face and that has to be encouraged when this is all over.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans include prioritisation of patient care, reconfiguration of hospital services, urgent discharge of all medically fit patients, and an end to general hospital visiting – with very limited exceptions. Trusts will also be maximising and utilising all spare capacity in residential, nursingand domiciliary care. The plans are detailed in a letter to Trust chief executives from the Department’s Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly. Mr Pengelly’s letter to colleagues states: “Our health and social care system has never been more needed nor more under pressure than it is today. Right across our system, from top to bottom, people are shouldering this burden and doing all they can to prepare services for the full impact of Covid-. googletag.cmd.push “In that context, I want to start by putting on record my deep gratitude to you and everyone in your teams for the determination, commitment and energy being brought to this daunting task. I hope you all draw strength from the incredible public support that is evident for our health service and all those who work in it.” The letter acknowledges: “Eventhe social distancing measures have the impact we hope, our modelling still indicates that we will require more critical care capacity than is currently available.” Trusts had already moved to postpone all non-urgent elective appointments in order to free up stafffor additional training. googletag.cmd.push The next stage – in the event of the Covid- pandemic moving into dferent phases – will involve further measures to concentrate resources on essential patient care. “In some cases, it is recognised that this may mean that other services are temporarily reduced as the focus is on providing essential services and helping those most at risk access the best possible treatment. “It is therefore suggested that clinicians should begin to categorise patients into priority groups. The lowest prioritisation would be where treatment can be delayed for - months with no predicted negative outcome. Urgent and emergency treatments should continue to be given top priority.” Issues also dealt with in the letter include provision of Personal Protection Equipment , supply of ventilators and other respiratory equipment, Covid- testing, and staff accommodation. “For those staff affected by the -day household isolation policy, staff should - on an entirely voluntary basis - be offered the alternative option of staying in hotel accommodation while they continue to work. This should be organised locally by HSC Trusts.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They entered the MacLarnon Cup in  and won it at the first time of asking. Michael McMullan caught up with Ballinascreen man Kenny Bradley to take a look back... Kenny Bradley still vividly remembers the words of Master Brian McKevitt, asit was yesterday. The Louth man taught in St Patricks Maghera in the early years, before later moving on to the Abbey in Newry. Bradley and his mates were constantly told by McKevitt that St Patricks Maghera should be making its mark on the Ulster school scene. He would tell them the Derry club scene was among the best in Ireland. googletag.cmd.push With hindsight, McKevitt was proven right. Derry clubs have cleaned up all over Ulster and St Patricks Maghera would amass  MacRory Cup titles since their first in . They sit just four titles behind St Colmans, who lead the roll of honour. The adventure had to start somewhere. Someone had to break new ground. With Sean Spud Murphy in charge, St Patricks Maghera entered the MacLarnon Cup in  and won it at the first time of asking. It may be the forgotten team in that long illustrious list of successful teams on the corridor walls of St Patricks but, this group was indeed special. googletag.cmd.push To mark the Golden Jubilee, the  were due to come together earlier this month, for the first time in  years to mull over their memories. The recent coronavirus outbreak, put their plans on ice, but such was the enthusiasm for the initial idea, it has been put on the back burner until later in the year. On answering the phone in his Sixtowns home last week, Kenny Bradley was in his element, sting through ious clippings and artefacts. History, not necessarily sport, is in his DNA and all the memories from the year Maghera took their infant steps into Ulster Schools football have given him another spark. The school opened in  and this was now the first A-Level class to reach Upper Sixth. “We wouldnt have been allowed into the MacRory because you would have to have qualied through the MacLarnon,” Bradley outlines. Before that, the late Frankie Kearney and Brian McKevitt were involved with the youth teams. Ironically, when Maghera reached the semi-final of the MacRory in their first year, , it was Abbey – with McKevitt at the helm – who ran out narrow winners. Before that, came the gradual building blocks towards the class of  setting an example for others to follow. There were  boys in the first register in September of  and it built up over the next five years. It saw the school begin to field against local teams: St Colms Draperstown, St Pius Magherafelt and St Patricks Dungiven. “Once we went above that, we moved into the Ulster Colleges competitions,” Bradley added. A Corn na nOacuteg quarter-final place the previous year brought hope, wrote Lower Sixth pupil Barney Kielt in the school magazine that year. County minors Frankie McCotter, Mickey Moran, Eugene Laverty, Vincent Conway and Brendan Kelly were back on board. In from St Malachys Belfast came Cargin duo Packie McGuckin and Pat ONeill, who was on their winning Rannafast team. In the MacLarnon Cup, Dungannon Academy, St Patricks Omagh and St Marys Irvinestown all withdrew from Magheras group, left them with just Omagh CBS to play-off with to decide semi-finals pairings. Scores were hard to come by on a frosty December morning on Omaghs home pitch, as Maghera were - to - winners. Central to the win, as Kielt outlined, was midfield control from Conway and Laverty, helping set up scores for Liam Harbinson and Brendan Kelly. “Omagh had a great team back then,” Kenny Bradley recalls. “Their goalkeeper, Ciaran Harte, would have played for Tyrone, in goals as their reserve keeper. “The full-back was Willie McKenna, a brother of Eugene and Dessie McKenna. He went on to work over around Drumsurn, in the forestry. He played minor and U for Tyrone.” With challenge games against local Glen and Slaughtneil teams, St Patricks prepared for their semi-final with St Patricks Armagh, which Bradley describes as a tight enough game. In dficult conditions in Coalisland, it was a - brace after half-time that saw them book a place in the final against Omagh, who had defeated Dundalk on the other side of the draw. Given it being their first final and Omagh having played in the  MacRory semi-final, Kenny Bradley didnt really feel Maghera were going in as underdogs. “We knew we had a good team. We had played MacRory teams early on . We played Malachysin a friendly match down in Newbridge. We were short a couple of good players that day and they beat us by a point. It was a good tight game. We knew then, that we were as good as anybody. They also gave St Columbs Derry a good tight run at the start of the year. “We had boys like Eugene Laverty and Mickey Moran. Eugene Laverty wouldve ran through a hedge, that was the type of him – a big strong player and very dominant.” The sides were level at half-time in the final and when Pat ONeill edged Maghera into a - to - lead early in the second half, they never looked back. There was no All-Ireland series for the MacLarnon champions at that time. “I have no doubt that we wouldve won it, we were good enough and we had the stuff,” Bradley said, with confidence. Bradley, Vincent Conway and Brendan Kelly left the post-match celebrations and swtly headed for the Coalisland dressing rooms. At that time, in the Derry league, Ballinascreen fielded three teams – one in each ision – and on the day of the final, “We headed into Neillysfathers car and headed to Ballinascreen to play against Castledawson in the league. “We missed the celebrations and I remember thinking afterwards, were we feckin mad in the head. Youd think there would never be another game, but that was how mad we were to play football.” The team stopped in what it now called the Central Bar in Cookstown for a meal on the way home but Principal Fr Donnelly was far from happy with the Screen exodus. “He took Neilly out of class the next day. He gave him six slaps and a  lines for not showing up at the meal. I dont knowhe was telling the truth or not,” Bradley jokes. “We didnt worry too much about the celebrations back them. As Willie McKennalater mentioned to me....you played a match and when it was finished,there was another one, you went and played that, you never questioned who won or lost.” Behind the success was Sean Murphy, who had been in the school five years, who volunteered to take the team. “There was nobody busting themselves to get taking teams,” Bradley highlights. “He was the kind of man that called a spade a spade and we liked that about him. He hit the right note, there was no fuss with him, he just got on with it. “There were no sophisticated tactics, he picked the team the way he wanted and the boys did the rest.” Another change Bradley notices now, how more accessible school sport is and how much easier it is to stay behind for training. “There were no taxis in our day. I live up at the top of the Sixtowns, beside the Shepherds Rest, and you had to thumb it home. “It was hard to stay for the training and thats why we couldve been a lot betterwe had the modern-day facilities with boys being dropped off . Everybody wouldve been training all the time.” Bradley points to St Columbs being the team at that time but were on the wane. “The South Derry boys were starting to come to Maghera, and so too the Dungiven ones. Theywere still the big fellas but it wasnt long before Maghera overtook them.” But it was the class of  that was the real change in momentum. When the coronavirus crisis subsides and le s to relative normality, Kenny Bradley will get the wheels in motion to unite the team, who are all in good health. “They all went on to have good careers and good jobs in le. Youd have to say, they all fared fierce well for themselves. Its tara how quick the times goes past...its a flash. Brian McKevitt knew his football. Every journey begins with a single step and the team of  were the pioneers of Magheras summit to the top of Ulster schools football.

If not, then why not  When the restrictions attached to social distancing are relaxed and normality s, I would dearly love to see theof jumpers for goalposts and youngsters doing what we did back in the day. Play football – around the ious skirmishes that would iniably break out – until dark. It would promote a more social element and also an encouragement for players to take on someone in a one versus one dual. From speaking to Rainey hockey coach, Carolyn Burns, last week it was heartening to hear her insistence in first years playing continuous three versus three at training, for virtually the whole year. Her mantra, to encourage creativity. On the telly last week, I saw two artists in sky blue. First it was Alan Brogan. I loved watching him selling wholesale dummies to defenders as he dragged Dublin to victory almost single-handedly. Then on Saturday night there was Maradona film. He had a dishevelledmop of hair, he wasnt tall, didnt look particularly athletic but boy was he a baller. I now know why he was able to dance around the England defence for that  wonder goal. He was getting kicked from pillar to post on the pitches of Italys Serie A. His weaving in and out, we just dont get it all. Imagine Napoli coach Ottavio Bianchi or Carlos Bilardo telling Maradona to recycle the ball. Systems in football also bring a certain level of intrigue. I enjoy studying tactics as much as the next person, but it will only take you so faryou dont have playersto win games. This is more relevant now, in an era of intense analysis and teams dissecting each others game plan to the nth degree. When you think of Enda Muldoons pass through the Slaughtneil defence for Collie Devlins county final winning goal – it was like threading the eye of a needle. Jarlath Devlin and the youth of Magherafelt last weekends wheelie bin challenge is just what the game needs to develop the next genuis. ALSO READ - Give goalkeepers an option. Click here...

I loved watching him selling wholesale dummies to defenders as he dragged Dublin to victory almost single-handedly. Then on Saturday night there was Maradona film. He had a dishevelledmop of hair, he wasnt tall, didnt look particularly athletic but boy was he a baller. I now know why he was able to dance around the England defence for that  wonder goal. He was getting kicked from pillar to post on the pitches of Italys Serie A. His weaving in and out, we just dont get it all. Imagine Napoli coach Ottavio Bianchi or Carlos Bilardo telling Maradona to recycle the ball. Systems in football also bring a certain level of intrigue. I enjoy studying tactics as much as the next person, but it will only take you so faryou dont have playersto win games. This is more relevant now, in an era of intense analysis and teams dissecting each others game plan to the nth degree. When you think of Enda Muldoons pass through the Slaughtneil defence for Collie Devlins county final winning goal – it was like threading the eye of a needle. Jarlath Devlin and the youth of Magherafelt last weekends wheelie bin challenge is just what the game needs to develop the next genuis. ALSO READ - Give goalkeepers an option. Click here...

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping setup Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, it was in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. googletag.cmd.push The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. googletag.cmd.push By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captained them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore. “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save from Damian Cassidy denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final defeat to Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he thought at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been an Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty – slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that saw Bellaghy win three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after bring replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Danny began to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from him. It was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblaney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team. We had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Seamus Mamma Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghy hands. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beaten the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you.” Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping setup Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, it was in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. googletag.cmd.push The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. googletag.cmd.push By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captained them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore. “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save from Damian Cassidy denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final defeat to Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he thought at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been an Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty – slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that saw Bellaghy win three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after bring replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Danny began to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from him. It was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblaney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team. We had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Seamus Mamma Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghy hands. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beaten the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you.” Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

The meeting was organised to discuss road maintenance in rural communities.The South Derry representatives raised the urgency for works on a number of roads that have suffered year after year of inclement weather and lack of surface treatment.CampaignMs Sheerin said she had been contacted by constituents who are concerned about the poor surfacing and maintenance on our rural network of roads. “I will continue to campaign for a number of roads that require urgent resurfacing that include the Sixtowns Road, Moneyneany Road, and the Desertmartin to Draperstown Road.“Improving rural roads and identying those areas that are in greatest need is a priority for rural safety. “I have requested that a scheme of works is designed and ready for resurfacing through Moneyneany village, from the Moydamlaght Road to the Drumderg Road. “Unfortunately, as with other schemes, this is dependent on departmental finance that has not been made available. “The minister has responsibility to ensure rural safety on our roads and that they are maintained to the relevant standard. I will continue to pressure the DfI Minister Nicola Mallon to release funding for this much needed work as a matter of urgency.”Engineers from the department were present and the local representatives pressed officials on a prepared scheme from Draperstown to Desertmartin for resurfacing along the stretch of road on the Draperstown side which did not benefit the last time work was carried out on this road.Cllr McGuigan said he had also used the meeting to highlight safety concerns on the A Glenshane Road ..“In the interest of road safety I have liaised with the department continuously on the need to address a suitable outcome for traffic travelling northbound on the Glenshane Pass turning right at the junction of Ranaghan Road. “The Glenshane Pass is a major road connection linking Belfast to Derry Donegal with high volume of commuters using both lanes, those turning right at the Ranaghan junction must come to a halt in the climbing lane.“The safety of motorists must come first and a new design is required to address these concerns on the Glenshane Pass and avoid a potential serious incident.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This is a great chance for children to experience familiar books brought to le by the author who created them.Leading audiobook company Audible have also released a collection of stories available for children to stream online via this link. Keep responding to reading  A large part of the guided reading curriculum in school involves responding to what they are reading. While some readers may remember copious comprehension questions from their time at school, there are a number of activities that can be used to help with this. St Peter’s and St Paul’s, Foreglen principal Michael O’Kane has posted  guided reading activities that can be downloaded via PDF, PowerPoint or Keynote via his Twitter account. Mathletics – www.mathletics  Some of you may already be familiar with Mathletics as it is used in a number of schools. If not – get involved! Students can design their own avatar and compete against each other in a iety of challenges, activities and games. If your child is using the programme through school, they will have a log-in of their own, or you can sign up as a Home User on their website for a -hour free trial. There are plenty more free maths activities online – Topmarks, Maths Zone and Math Playground are just three examples. Google is your friend. Lego challenges An age-old favourite, Lego has been entertaining children and adults since its inception in . Many schools operate after-school Lego clubs and it has remained a staple favourite for Golden Time on Friday afternoons across the sector. Blogger Christina Shirley has shared a resource on her website that lists  days’ worth of Lego challenges for parents and children to get through. Of course, once the  days are up and you’ve got the hang of it, you can have a go at setting your child challenges yourself! Learn a language  I have banged the bilingualism drum for many years and now that the unexpected closures have left you with some time, now is the perfect time to learn a language. Duolingo has over  languages available on their online service and is an interactive way to pick up a language. While more suited to older users, this activity could be done together by parents and children, and the app is available to download on most devices.  Get activeBeing stuck at home all day can tempt many children into sedentary habits, but one of the most effective ways to ensure concentration is to get moving. Many schools operate brain breaks between lessons as well as the usual break and lunch play time and have found it increases pupil engagement and achievement. There are plenty of online videos that guide children through short bursts of exercise that are ideal for slotting into children’s timetables for a quick workout. Joe Wickshas been entertaining children on his YouTube channel since the beginning of lockdown and helping them stay alert and engaged. Keep an eye on your local GAA club too, as most have set challenges for their young players! Virtual museum tours  In the modern age, many museums can be accessed remotely via the internet. Website Southern Living has compiled a list of  famous museums that you can tour from the comfort of your own home. Write about it  Given a purpose and an audience, children love to write. With all that time going spare, encourage them to put pen to paperand create. If they are recording a diary of their time in lockdown, encourage them not only to focus on what is happening around them, but how they feel about it. Unprecedented situations can force creativity to the surface as a coping mechanism. We are happy to take submissions from children, young and old.

Make use of the school packs, ideas and resources as much as you can but remember – this is not worth having a row about. Tension is already too high. Many parents are working from home while trying to balance childcare and the fuses may be running quite short, but children are in a vulnerable place. They have ied understanding of the situation. Some will be oblivious, some will sense the worried atmosphere and others may be concerned for the safety of elderly relatives. Get them out and about – social distancing permitting, and only once a day! – and use the time to let them experience the world around them. Go to the beach. Walk in the forest. Laugh. Eventually the world willto normal and children will tell anyone who will listen in years to come that they lived through the coronavirus pandemic of .

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Rosemarie and Sean Lynn from Dungiven tied the knot in a simple ceremony at St Columba’s Church, Long Tower after their original date fell victim to Covid-. The couple were married last Tuesday evening at :pm, just hours before government regulations banned weddings were due to be introduced. Rosemarie told the County Derry Post they were determined to go ahead with the ceremony. She said: “We got engaged in November and decided we’d get married on the th of April this year. googletag.cmd.push “A few weeks ago, our venue rang and said with coronavirus, they weren’t going to be open. “It was important for us to get married and have family and friends back at the house, so we brought it forward to Saturday the th of March.”  Boris Johnson and the British government had other ideas, however, and Monday’s announcement that weddings were banned left the couple ‘numb’. Things changed when Sean and Rosemarie rang their driver to inform him of the developments. “Brian, our limousine driver and he said: ‘Why don’t you ring the council and see what they can do ’ “So I rang and said we had the papers, we were getting married in the church and the priest was willing to marry us, but we needed the go-ahead from the council. She said to leave it with her. googletag.cmd.push “I was praying to St Anthony when the lady from the council rang back and said we had the go-ahead until  o’clock that night to get married.” The short time frame became even tighter as Rosemarie’s fianceacute Sean finished a sht as an emergency medical technician with the Ambulance Service. “Rosemarie rang and said: you’d better come home quickly because we’re getting married tonight,” said Sean. “I rang the duty control manager and was shocked when they gave the go-ahead for special circumstances. “I had to come home, lt the wean, scrub up quickly and get into the chapel. Of course, she was  minutes late.” Denied the luxury of time that most brides have to prepare for their wedding, Rosemarie was forced to improvise. She said: “I got ready, did my own nails, my own make-up, put the fake tan on, did the whole thing myself. “I had a wee dress I got last year that I just loved. It wasn’t even meant to be for a wedding, I just bought it because I liked it. “It felt like I was in a film. I wasn’t nervous, I was excited, but it was almost an out-of-body experience.” The couple’s faith was central to their decision-making, and both were delighted with the simple ceremony. Sean said: “I’m over the moon, I really am. “The big day would have been great to have, but the sacrament between me, her and God was the main thing.” “The ceremony was beautul,” said Rosemarie. “It was the two of us, the priest, two witnesses and Sean’s wee boy and we all had to stand six feet apart and sit six feet apart in the limousine because of the regulations. Although the couple were able to celebrate with a few drinks at Sean’s house, the honeymoon is on hold as he helps battle the threat of Covid-. He said: “We have a few days to spend together and keep le simple. I’m going out to C every day, so I’m glad for a few hours of something positive.” Rosemarie is hugely proud of her husband’s role. She said: “He’ll be back out in a few days saving lives, that’s what he loves to do. “He always was that kind of person who cares for people, and that’s what it’s all about now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its the members who make up the group who keep each other going. I look out the window and see the candle in my neighbours window. It is a source of strength and well as a symbol of hope, and I think we will need it more and more over the coming weeks.The group has attracted members from across the globe as far afield as Taiwan, Buenos Aires and AustraliaThe site is for people of all faiths and none, although most are Christian, said Mrs OHare.I never thought it would have so many followers.We are just happy to be able to support one another and for people to see our light through the window or online. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Letrsquos look out for each other in these turbulent times.Cllr McMurray mdash who spoke ahead of Mondayrsquos ban on access to Tyrella beach mdash said that last weekend he had been ldquoinundated with messages and calls regarding the number of people attending local forest parks.ldquoUnfortunately, it appears that the general population is not adhering to the advice in relation to social distancing and I would suggest that they are nearly treating this crisis as a national holiday.I will be reviewing access to our forest parks with party leaders and senior management team, he said.ldquoWe have been pushing a lot of advice and guidance with regard to the need for social distancing but it is not resting with the population. It is so dficult to balance the need to allow people the space to walk to protect mental and health and well-being, but we ask that the public refer to guidelines set out by public health officials to do so safely.Cllr Lewis said the closure of leisure centres, play areas, council-owned facilities and schools across this district had been done for peoplersquos safety.ldquoI appeal to people to recognise why these areas are closed, he continued. ldquoPlay parks and sporting facilities should not be used. It is imperative that we recognise and accept the seriousness of this illness. It simply cannot be business as usual, we must heed all relevant medical advice.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThis is for our own safety, while also protecting the integrity of our health service and those vital, dedicated experienced staff who support it. Newry, Mourne and Down Council has taken extreme measures and please respect these steps. This isnrsquot a holiday and itrsquos not a jolly. We are protecting le.Cllr Gallagher said it was vital that everyone in the community ensures that social isolation is adhered to, highlighting the need to reduce the risk.He added: ldquoThe elderly and those with predisposed health conditions need to keep their distance and follow public health guidelines. Remain at homepossible and get someone to do your shopping. Family units are important. People must not allow others into their home and visits that are not essential must stopCllr Howell said that last week the Education Minister finally declared that schools would close to help prevent the spread of COVID-, highlighting the huge responsibility on parents to ensure that not just children are safe, but so are those they are in contact with.She added: ldquoUnfortunately, some young people think that this is the start of their summer holidays and they are free to continue with no worries or concerns. I am appealing to parents to inform their children about social distancing and the importance of adhering to the public health guidelines.ldquoIf your teenager goes out can you be confident that they will observe the required social distancing of two metres  Many of them donrsquot have the willpower to practice what is being advised.ldquoAs a parent I know only too well how hard it is to keep teenagers from going out, but we need to set the example to our children. If these social distancing rules are not adhered to, they will come home and unknowingly pass the virus to others, perhaps family members with underlying health issues or aged grandparents..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 Pretend.jpg","title":"‘Pretend cough’ over credit union worker  ","story":"POLICE will be contacted after a saver in Downpatrick Credit Union ldquopretend coughed at a staff member last week during the coronavirus outbreak, it has been revealed.Mary Cullen, chair of Downpatrick Credit Union, warned that it was now operating a ldquozero tolerance policy as incidents of verbal abuse to staff increased during reduced opening hours.She said the credit union, which is situated in Market Street, had been inundated with messages of support after she posted a warning post on Facebook last Friday where she asked members to respect everyonersquos boundaries regarding social distancing and to accept the new reduced hours cover.She said a member of the public verbally abused a member of staff before ldquopretend coughing at them.ldquoThis particular incident is not acceptable and going forward, unfortunately, Members who cannot be courteous to our staff will not be served, said Mary in her post.ldquoWe are in a very dangerous time and are doing the best that we can. We are very lucky to have an amazing team at DCU, letrsquos appreciate and respect them as they try to continue to provide a service to members.ldquoThe support for my staff has been phenomenal.

If people did go out, they were advised to keep two metres apart.Council officials say the latest closures are part of the organisationrsquos ongoing coronavirus response and that the decision will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with Public Health Agencyguidance.Last week, council officials had decided to keep Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park open and had agreed to waive the entrance fee to both facilities. But there was a dramatic U-turn on Monday when these two popular facilities also went into lockdown.Across the district a range of community events have been cancelled with last Sundayrsquos horse race meeting at Downpatrick taking place behind closed doors, with spectators locked out.The local authority want people to obey self-distancing requirements with its decision to close Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park further evidence of its concern about people spreading the virus.It is clear that both facilities have now been placed in the ldquohigh risk category alongside the districtrsquos leisure and community centres.

It may not be popular, but sometimes we need to take the tough decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, after the droves of people went to local parks and forests on Sunday, it appears people still arenrsquot taking the coronavirus issue seriously and are clearly flouting PHA guidelines.Cllr Owens added: ldquoThis is not a decision that Newry, Mourne and Down Council wanted to take as we had hoped that common sense may have prevailed. It was a decision we were forced to take and we must do all we can to stop the spread of this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 25%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos Grand Cinema is to re-open in September, six years after it closed its doors.Workmen will move in shortly to give the cinema a pound, facelt and when the picture house is re-opened, it should be able to compete with the best in Ireland.That is the aim of Mr Harley Breen, the owner of the cinema, who this week outlined the work which needs to be completed before the curtain opens.ldquoWork is expected to take around six months and will involve completely refurbishing the inside of the cinema, Mr Breen explained.ldquoWe will be taking out all the seating and replacing it with a new type of seating, the most exclusive available.

Godrsquos love goes on. Godrsquos love never ends and He can use each of us in this time of crisis. Let us remember that God desires to be with us in this storm. Let us remember it will pass and let us ask Him for his saving help to overcome all the trials.ldquoAt this time, we are reminded the word corona is Latin for crown.Let us remember that Christians trust in Christ the King, who wears the crown of salvation and is the author of le.While the clergy share the sorrow that church services cannot proceed in public, some services are still being offered online via Facebook, live video or recorded on YouTube. There are also blogs, and other resources.They said: ldquoEveryone is welcome to watch and pray and have spiritual communion and draw le from the word of God.ldquoWherever possible, come and join us online and on Facebook and worship in spirit and in truth. Watching television and radio incessantly can lead to anxiety and stress.ldquoPrayer and worship offer a healing alternative. We need to take time to focus on the Good News.

God is constantly telling us not to be afraid, that He is with us.ldquoHe reminds us to turn away from our sin, our  gods and to turn to Him for help. He speaks of His faithfulness, His constant and everlasting love.ldquoIn times like this, we see very clearly that the distractions from God, such as money or endless entertainment, cannot save us, cannot satisfy us. We need God in our lives to strengthen us, comfort us, forgive us and nourish our hearts and drooping spirits.The clergymen said ure reminded people not to take more than they need, that the Lord provides enough for each day.ldquoLet us guard against selfishness and, like the Hebrews, who received manna from Heaven, only take what we need for the day. This is a demonstration of real love, putting God and other people first.They pointed out that St Patrick, faced many hardships, isolation, helplessness, cold, hunger, sickness and many times, the threat of death.They recalled that it was in captivity and isolation that the young Patrick grew close to God, having arrived in Ireland a teenager with no real faith in what he had been taught by his Christian parents.ldquoIn his famous Confession, Patrick wrote that in his suffering he became aware of his lack of faith. He wrote: ldquoSo I turned with all my heart to the Lord My God...He protected me and he consoled me as a Father for his son...There is no other God...The Lord God said through the prophet, lsquoCall on me in the day of distress and I will set you free and you will glory mersquo.They said this is a reminder that ldquoGod truly is our shield in the stre. There is only God. There is no other saviour. We are people of the cross. But we are people of the resurrection too.

We will also continue to engage with the local sector and keep them informed as the situation evolves.The suspension of driving tests runs from Monday of this week to until June , with the decision kept under review.Ms Mallon said people who have a driving test scheduled during this period will have the test rescheduled or may apply for a refund.She continued: ldquoThe DVA will issue clear instructions in the coming days advising candidates of next steps and updates around the re-starting of driving tests and details will be published online on nidirect.ldquoWe are experiencing an unprecedented and fast-evolving situation. In line with the current guidance, it is necessary to adopt these measures to protect customers, staff and to allow the DVA to prioritise essential services. These measures will be kept under review and updated as necessary.The infrastructure minister said while the current circumstances are ldquoexceptional, in relation to emergency workers and essential service drivers needing a driving test, the DVA will make all reasonable efforts to accommodate these customers.Ms Mallon added: ldquoI would encourage the public to continue to do what they can to delay the spread of the virus and follow the latest advice from the Public Health Agency.ldquoI know this is a frightening time for people, but want to reassure them that within my Department and working with all government departments, we will continue to do all we can to keep people safe.Further information about the suspension of driving tests and how to apply for an emergency driving test will be provided over the coming days..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 Shutters.jpg","title":"Shutters go down in towns  ","story":"THE people of the district have been given an unequivocal message this week to help stop the spread of the deadly coronavirus mdash stay at home.A series of unprecedented measures announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday night will see town centres deserted, with businesses having to comply with a stringent lockdown set to be in force for the foreseeable future as the battle against coronavirus enters a crucial new stage.The sweeping measures aimed at preventing the spread of the disease are to be reviewed in three weeksrsquo time.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I shall avoid places and persons where my presence is not needed in order not to become contaminated and thus perchance inflict and pollute others and so cause their death as a result of my negligence. ‘If God should wish to take me, he will surely find me and I have done what he has expected of me and so I am not responsible for either my own death or the death of others.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Right across our system, from top to bottom, people are shouldering this burden and doing all they can to prepare services for the full impact of COVID-.“In that context, I want to start by putting on record my deep gratitude to you and everyone in your teams for the determination, commitment and energy being brought to this daunting task. I hope you all draw strength from the incredible public support that is evident for our health service and all those who work in it.”The letter acknowledges: “Eventhe social distancing measures have the impact we hope, our modelling still indicates that we will require more critical care capacity than is currently available.”Trusts had already moved to postpone all non-urgent elective appointments in order to free up staff for additional training.The next stage – in the event of the COVID- pandemic moving into dferent phases – will involve further measures to concentrate resources on essential patient care.“In some cases, it is recognised that this may mean that other services are temporarily reduced as the focus is on providing essential services and helping those most at risk access the best possible treatment.“It is therefore suggested that clinicians should begin to categorise patients into priority groups. The lowest prioritisation would be where treatment can be delayed for two to three months with no predicted negative outcome. Urgent and emergency treatments should continue to be given top priority.”Issues also dealt with in the letter include provision of Personal Protection Equipment , supply of ventilators and other respiratory equipment, COVID- testing, and staff accommodation.“For those staff affected by the -day household isolation policy, staff should - on an entirely voluntary basis - be offered the alternative option of staying in hotel accommodation while they continue to work. This should be organised locally by HSC Trusts.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_edcbcbaae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_afebacaeaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1585225289547.jpg--swann_pays_tribute_to_health_staff_as_new_covid_centre_opens.jpg?158522528900","title":"swann pays tribute to health staff as new covid centre opens ","story":"EVERYONE must do their part to support healthcare professionals in the fight to stop the spread of Covid-, says Health Minister Robin Swann.Mr Swann was speaking as he visited the first Primary Care Covid- centre at Altnagelvin hospital site today. More centres will open in the coming days, with at least one Covid- centre in each Trust area.Minister Swann said: “Primary Care Covid- Centres are an essential part of the fight against this virus. To ensure vital GP services can be maintained throughout the coming weeks and months, it is absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with non Covid- related conditions. “Covid- centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of having Covid- and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to these centres without being referred by their GP or Out of Hours provider.“Whilst the centres will help to free up GP services to deal with the Covid- pandemic, it is vital we balance this with the need for primary care services to continue with the minimum of disruption.”Patients attending these centres will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.Dr Tom Black, Chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland, is among the GPs working at the new Primary Care Covid- Centre at Altnagelvin. He said: “GPs have organised themselves very quickly and there has been a huge amount of work done between the Department of Health, the Health and Social Care Board, Trusts and GP Federations to provide the community with these Covid- centres.“This method of GPs working in the middle ground is vital to protect hospital services for patients with the greatest need. I have no doubt that this work will save lives.”Concluding, the Health Minister said: “I want to pay tribute to the vision, rapid action and commitment shown by our primary care doctors. Without hesitation, they have risen to meet this unprecedented challenge. On behalf of everyone in our community I want to thank them for the hugely important work they are doing.“We must all now do our part to support these healthcare professionals in the fight to stop the spread of this virus.
