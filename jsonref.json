They can also pose a hazard to other road users if they are lost when the vehicle is moving.\u0027 Drivers in Cumbria’s Barrow-in-Furness were told they could be sanctioned by the council’s licensing committee for having the flags on their cars.The National Private Hire Association said all councils have different policies on taxi drivers displaying flags, but \u0027very few\u0027 ban the practice outright.The government has published new regulations regarding what is and is not allowed regarding flying flags in England.The government says the following flags do not require consent from a local planning authority:Any country’s national flag, civil ensign or civil air ensignThe flag of the Commonwealth, the European Union, the United Nations or any other international organisation of which the United Kingdom is a memberA flag of any island, county, district, borough, burgh, parish, city, town or village within the United KingdomThe flag of the Black Country, East Anglia, Wessex, any Part of Lincolnshire, any Riding of Yorkshire or any historic county within the United Kingdom (e) The flag of Saint DavidThe flag of Saint PatrickThe flag of any administrative area within any country outside the United KingdomAny flag of Her Majesty’s forcesThe Armed Forces Day flag.However, the regulations state that all flags must not \u0027obscure, or hinder the interpretation of official road, rail, waterway or aircraft signs, or otherwise make hazardous the use of these types of transport\u0027.

Riot police use tear gas during a protest of opponents of the deal between Greece and Macedonia          The preliminary deal signed by the two countries\u0027 foreign ministers in the Prespes Lakes area, Greece, launches a long process that will last several months          The agreement between Greece and Macedonia has aroused the fury of nationalists on both sidesMore than 4,000 Greek nationalists, who oppose another country having the Macedonia name, instead gathered near Pissoderi, a village 40 kilometers (25 miles) away. Banners in the crowd read \u0027There is only one Macedonia and it is Greek\u0027 and \u0027Macedonian identity can\u0027t be given away.\u0027Several hundred marched to a nearby police blockade and began throwing rocks.Police responded with tear gas and stun grenades.The clashes went on into the afternoon and Greek police said 12 people were injured, including six police officers.A demonstration against the deal attracted an estimated 3,000 people in the southern city of Bitola, Macedonian media reported.          Riot police use tear gas to disperse protesters during a violent protest of opponents in SkopjeThe rally was peaceful, but opposition leader Hristijan Mickoski of the VMRO-DPMNE party, the keynote speaker, used fighting words. He reiterated that his party would not support putting the new name in the Macedonian constitution, one of the terms of the deal.\u0027I, Hristijan Mickoski, speaking from the heart and with a clear mind..., never, at any price, even if that would cost (my) life, will I support this act of capitulation by Zoran Zaev,\u0027 Mickoski told the protesters.But the two countries\u0027 leaders have said the signing would be the start of closer relations between them and an example for all nations in the Balkans region.Recalling his first meeting with Zaev this year at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Tsipras told him that \u0027very few believed we would succeed\u0027 in ending \u002726 years of sterile dispute between our countries.\u0027           The demonstration turned violent when a group of people described by police as soccer hooligans started pelting officers with rocks and flares and tried to break through the police cordon          Police used tear gas and stun grenades to beat back the crowd and detained one person\u0027This is our own appointment with history,\u0027 Tsipras said, adding that Balkan peoples long have suffered from \u0027the poison of chauvinism and the isions of nationalist hatred.\u0027Zaev, for his part, hailed an \u0027end to decades of uncertainty.\u0027 Greece and Macedonia would henceforth be \u0027partners and allies\u0027 in modeling successful diplomacy for the whole region, he said.\u0027May we stay as united forever as we are on this day,\u0027 Zaev said.Following the signing, the officials took a boat to the Macedonian lake resort of Oteshevo for a celebratory lunch.But church bells in Psarades and nearby villages rang sorrowfully throughout the ceremony.Most of the village\u0027s 60 inhabitants watched from afar, clearly in a sour mood.\u0027The church bells rang mournfully because something died today in Greece,\u0027 said local Orthodox Christian priest Irinaios Hajiefremidis. \u0027They are taking from us our soul, our name.\u0027          People protest against the deal between Greece and Macedonia on Macedonia\u0027s new name, North Macedonia, in the southern Macedonia town of BitolaHajiefremidis noted the ethnic and religious conflicts that generations of Greeks, Serbs and Bulgarians fought over the land that makes up present-day Macedonia.\u0027Today, we commemorated Father George Papadopoulos, who was butchered on June 16, 1907 because he did not say Mass in Bulgarian,\u0027 he said.Feelings run as strongly in Macedonia, but there are wide differences of opinion.\u0027I didn\u0027t follow the signing. Follow what? The capitulation? The vanishing of my identity?\u0027 retired doctor Vera Jovanov said. \u0027I didn\u0027t get their approval to be what I am. Nothing will be good in the future. Nothing good for Macedonia.\u0027Taxi driver Devan Stojanoski said \u0027whatever we are called,\u0027 Macedonia\u0027s people need \u0027a chance for a better life and better standards.\u0027\u0027I do not care about the name any more. I am so disappointed about everything that I have stopped thinking and caring,\u0027 he said.The signing ceremony was recognised internationally as a significant event. Among those attending were U.N.

That, however, will require a longer-term solution including more border security.\u0027\u0027Border security\u0027 is the Trump administration\u0027s most common substitute language for the wall that Trump has promised since early in the presidential campaign.Aside from serving as legislative leverage to secure funding for the wall, the president and Sessions have repeatedly defended their chosen method of enforcing federal law, saying it has the added benefit of deterring future border-crossers.    Protesters blocked an entrance to the headquarters of US Customs and Border Protection during a protest on June 13 that included some Democratic members of Congress          Another group of protesters chanted slogans outside an ICE detention center in downtown Los Angeles on June 14, part of a push to oppose new family separation policiesThe president has sometimes blamed Democrats for his policy, drawing howls of protests and claims that Trump is a liar from commentators, immigration advocates and some news outlets as a whole, most notably CNN and The New York Times.Some in the administration have openly signaled their distaste with the policy and its effects.\u0027As a mother, as a Catholic, as somebody who\u0027s got a conscience ...

So none the less, that\u0027s what I tried to do.\u0027Despite these conversations however, allegations later surfaced that he had staged photographs with the paparazzi.Footage obtained by The Mail on Sunday showed the 73-year-old former lighting director arriving at an internet cafe with photographer Jeff Rayner.Minutes later the pair are seen preparing to photograph Mr Markle while he is sitting at a computer looking at a news story about his daughter and Prince Harry.Shortly after the furore, Mr Markle was taken to hospital to have three stents fitted.          Mr Markle opened up about conversations he had with the pair about the media attention surrounding himHe told GMB he had apologised to both Harry and Meghan, adding: \u0027I realised it was a serious mistake. It\u0027s hard to take it back.\u0027The staged photographs came despite Kensington Palace issuing a warning to publishers to respect Mr Markle\u0027s privacy, saying he had been \u0027harassed\u0027 by paparazzi.A Mail on Sunday investigation established that the internet cafe pictures were part of a series Rayner took of Meghan\u0027s father.They were published in newspapers, magazines and on websites around the world.Other pictures of Mr Markle taken by Rayner include one of him studying a book of British landmarks at a Starbucks cafe, and another in which he appears to be working out with weights to get in shape for the big day.Another picture apparently showing Mr Markle exercising in a bid to shed weight ahead of the big day also appeared in a British newspaper. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33d29b52a76400ed4cb435655a47adaac60ce36e/503_175_3003_1802/master/3003.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bd52b446d7c38f329a272dd15cc588a","title":"big picture dagmar hochova two on a bridge czechoslovakia","story":"It is 50 years since the Prague spring, that expression of rebellion and love in the Czech capital that ended in August 1968 with Russian tanks on the streets and another generation of Soviet repression. Dagmar Hochová took photographs that captured all of the hopes and fears of the long postwar struggle for freedom in her country, which culminated in the Velvet Revolution of 1989.Hochová was born in 1926 and lived most of her life in Prague until her death in 2012. Though her pictures were sometimes overtly political – the young, ostracised Václav Havel, at home the “march of silence” against the Russian invasion – Hochová became best known as a photographer of children. This was partly a question of expedience. Childhood was one of the few aspects of the city’s life that was effectively beyond the censor’s control. Hochová’s camera sought out the mischief and spirit of Czech kids playing in the streets. The exuberance she was drawn to was no doubt a statement of subversive intent at a time when freedom of expression was outlawed – there was also plenty of pure innocent joy.This picture, part of the first UK retrospective of Hochová’s work, captures all of that youthful Bohemian spirit. It was taken on a bridge over the Vltava River in 1959. After the Russian coup in 1948 there had been long years of Stalinist purges of artists and agitators, and the creation of all the grey apparatus of a police state, but that world seems far removed from these two girls. They lean into Hochová’s lens with freckled and dimpled devilment, challenging the viewer not to share their grins, infant fists clenched in an innocent echo of a wider defiance.The Power of Sympathy: The Photography of Dagmar Hochová, organised by the Czech Centre, runs from Wednesday until 29 June at the 12 Star Gallery, Europe House, London\u0026nbspSW1"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a149f83bad08686d7e62f5ffeef2631ec2da45d3/0_716_6943_4166/master/6943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c9923ede7e01621e50161a13223b76d","title":"field day festival drawings in pictures","story":"Earlier this month, London-based artist Joey Yu headed to Field Day, a two-day music festival held in south London’s Brockwell Park, to record the action with crayons, pencils and paper.

We all now have our shelf of go-to books to help us, yet there was a time when this wasn’t considered “proper” history. Here are five volumes that help you understand the domestic lives of people in the past – and why they came to matter.Mark Girouard was one of the first architectural historians who started to think that there was more to the history than connoisseurship and assigning buildings to particular architects. His exploration of the development of things such as the dessert course, or the mechanics of plumbing, in his groundbreaking Life in the English Country House (1978) underpins a lot of the information you’ll come across if you visit a historical house. Of course, since it was first published, historians’ interests have broadened out from the stately pile to a whole range of dwellings, from workers’ houses to the streetscapes you might find in living history museums.But do you have a lingering feeling that constitutional or diplomatic history is more serious, more worthy? Well the personal is the political, a point made, at the same time as Girouard was writing, in the wildly popular and highly influential novel by Marilyn French, The Women’s Room (1977). I cannot erase from my mind French’s astonishingly realistic re-creation of the heroine Mira’s terrible, turgid housework routine.Many a feminist-in-waiting had their eyes opened by both the trials of Mira’s life and what she eventually did with it. She decided she’d had enough of housework and went off to study literature at university instead. I can imagine the decisions of 1970s women like her forming the case studies in a future version of Amanda Vickery’s landmark study of women’s lives in the 18th century, The Gentleman’s Daughter (1998). It delicately and movingly unpicks the ways in which the daughters of gentlemen had a bit more power – despite the restrictive Georgian clothing – than you might think to make decisions of their own.The Gentleman’s Daughter was based on the archival discoveries of a historian with an interest in material things. Meanwhile books in its wake, such as Eleri Lynn’s Tudor Fashion (2017), turn round the telescope to work outwards from the surviving objects of the past. The book gathers and analyses some amazing survivals of 16th-century textiles, and then goes on to use replicas to illustrate exactly how each garment should be worn and accessorised, and what it signified. It’s a book that’s in daily use here at Tudor Towers.Finally, fancy reading a published primary source full of detail about eating pease pudding, doing the laundry, having piles and a literate pig? After you have devoured the obvious starting point of the journals of Samuel Pepys, graduate to the less well known record of James Woodforde’s country rectory life in Norfolk. In his The Diary of a Country Parson, 1758-1802, first published in the 1920s and reissued many times throughout the 20th century, literally almost nothing happens. But in Woodforde’s hands daily life is magically made fascinating."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56ebc6bfea61bf45f8e9e01200aeacc0d877f3f0/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9f2dc4a1b182c72b5cd05b49ff329bb","title":"quentin blake to auction joyful mother and baby watercolours","story":"Pictures from illustrator’s personal collection will be auctioned for charity in JulyRevealing another side to the much-loved illustrator of classic children’s novels such as The BFG and The Twits, Sir Quentin Blake’s series of watercolours of naked mothers with their babies feature in an assortment of pictures from the acclaimed illustrator’s personal collection which are due to be auctioned for charity next month.The images, drawn for the delivery room at the university hospital in Angers, France, show the women swimming underwater with their babies, among seaweed, or breastfeeding. They form part of a collection of 178 illustrations from Blake which Christie’s will auction between 3 and 12 July to raise money for The House of Illustration, Roald Dahl’s Marvellous Children’s Charity and Survival International.“They’re of mothers and babies swimming about underwater, of course they’ve got no clothes on,” said Blake, the UK’s first children’s laureate and the winner of the 2002 Hans Christian Andersen award for illustration. “l hope they’re joyful.”Covering four decades of Blake’s career, the illustrations range from his portrayal of the long-lost Beatrix Potter character, Kitty-in-Boots, to his illustrations for David Walliams’ Mr Stink, and the first book he illustrated for Roald Dahl, The Enormous Crocodile. A mix of what Blake calls “alternative versions” and preliminary drawings, the collection also includes Blake’s initial painstaking attempts to get the BFG’s ears right – which Dahl described as “a bit preposterous”.“It was him working out how big the ears should be,” said Christies’ Sophie Hopkins of Blake’s illustrations. “There is always a gulf between the author and the illustrator, and in this case the first version wasn’t quite right, and Roald Dahl sent it back. The drawings give you an insight into how he is constantly trying to create the character shown on the page.”“I get very concerned about whether this is a better likeness than that. Sometimes after I’ve done it I can’t even tell later why I chose that one – and sometimes I think I chose the wrong one,” said Blake, in a video interview for Christies about his “alternative versions”. “When I’m doing the roughs I’m thinking I am that person. It is like performing it. The roughs are the rehearsals and then you have to go on and do it … I start with the face because if I think that isn’t quite right I’ll leave it there and start another one.”Alongside a raft of illustrations for Dahl’s writing, from Mrs Twit to George’s Granny, the collection also features pencil drawings from Blake’s exhibition Arrows of Love, showing nude women avoiding or embracing Cupid’s arrow. Christies said the “rarely-seen nudes reveal Blake’s personal reflections on the joy, folly and sorrow of love”.“What unifies his work is that wonderful line that captures the character he’s drawing – seemingly effortlessly, but the rest of us can only look on in awe,” said Hopkins. “There is so much affection captured in his drawings of mothers and babies – while they’re different in intent to his illustrations for Roald Dahl or David Walliams, what is really great is his drawing is so recognisable. That sense of mischief is what defines Quentin’s work – he’s a man with an eternal twinkle in his eye.”Estimates for the drawings range from £200 to £10,000, with 30 of the illustrations to be presented in Christies Valuable Books and Manuscripts auction on 11 July, with a dedicated online sale of the remaining 148 to be open for bidding from 3-12 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d22b96972529b7813884bd2436898070de5bb4a/0_100_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eef4e04811034228eb9d7ff1a9482d6","title":"deliveroos hiring conditions to face scrutiny by mps","story":"Frank Field’s work and pensions committee will investigate gig economyDeliveroo is facing a parliamentary inquiry into the pay and conditions of its couriers in the latest challenge to the gig economy.Frank Field MP, chairman of the work and pensions committee, which has already taken evidence from workers at Hermes, Uber, DPD and Parcelforce, will now gather evidence from Deliveroo riders over the next five weeks. The inquiry will include a round table at which the takeaway delivery service’s workers will give oral evidence. Field will also be writing to Deliveroo to gather evidence about pay and conditions for its cyclists and moped riders.“The weight of the evidence I’ve seen shows that bogus self-employment is being peddled by those who benefit so handsomely from the gig economy, to avoid the obligations they have to their workforce,” Field said. “I now wish to see if this is a partial view or whether it, sadly, represents what is going on in yet another company operating in the gig economy.”Field’s move comes as Deliveroo faces at least two legal cases over the employment rights of its riders. On Friday, the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents many gig economy workers, won the right to seek a judicial review of a ruling that found Deliveroo riders were not entitled to union representation.In November the Central Arbitration Committee, which considers union recognition and collective bargaining cases, rejected an application by the IWGB to represent drivers in parts of north London.It said thefirm’s riders were self-employed contractors because they had the right to allocate a substitute to do the work for them. The union had argued they were “workers” who enjoy limited rights including holiday pay and the right to collective bargaining.The high court agreed that Deliveroo riders were self-employed contractors but said it was arguable the CAC should have considered the right of the couriers, and other workers in a similar position, to bargain collectively – as enshrined in article 11 of the European convention on human rights.The union, which has raised £23,000 so far in crowdfunding for the legal costs of the case, is expected to launch the judicial review by the end of this year.Next month the law firm Leigh Day will be leading an employment tribunal action demanding better employment rights including the minimum wage, sick pay and paid holiday for Deliveroo riders. The tribunal case involves at least 20 delivery riders who say they are employees and not, as the company argues, self-employed contractors. The Leigh Day case can be brought as it will examine the historic contracts of Deliveroo riders rather than the latest contracts, which were updated by the company during the process of the CAC case.It comes after the employment rights of workers in the gig economy were boosted after a heating engineer won his claim against Pimlico Plumbers at the supreme court last week, establishing that he was a worker and not self-employed.The supreme court’s unanimous judgment is likely to set a significant precedent for a series of similar legal battles, including those involving the cab firms Uber and Addison Lee, which are in dispute with their drivers over employment status.Pimlico Plumbers, which lost at every stage of the dispute, had appealed to the UK’s highest court, arguing that those it sent out to repair leaking pipes and malfunctioning dishwashers were self-employed and not “workers”. Workers do not enjoy the full range of employment protection rights given to full-time staff but are entitled to many elements such as holiday pay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87d26f5c420d98046101d4aeb44634816d4c2db6/0_106_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0109f6f25eff3b5480eb59e12bd935f","title":"uk debit cards transactions overtake cash for the first time","story":"Debit card payments have overtaken cash as the most popular form of payment in the UK for the first time, according to banking industry figures.Cash has been overtaken by card payments a year earlier than expected, as more smaller businesses embraced contactless and consumers got used to the speed and ease of “wave and pay” or “tap and go”. The rising popularity of online shopping was cited by the report as another factor for cash losing ground.Gareth Shaw of the consumer group Which? said: “Clearly the way we shop and pay for services is changing but for millions of people in the UK cash still plays an essential role in their everyday lives. With bank branch closures on the rise and the UK’s free-to-use ATM network under threat, it’s vital these people are still able to access the cash they need.”The average adult made 54 payments a month last year, 20 by debit card and 20 by cash, including nine contactless payments.Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, said: “We’re far from becoming a cash-free society and despite the UK transforming to an economy where cash is less important than it once was, it will remain a payment method that continues to be valued and preferred by many.“These trends are likely to shift further over the next decade. Developments such as Open Banking are expected to bring extensive changes to the payments landscape, something that will likely shape how we interact with our money in the coming years.”Initially, “touch and go” was only offered by coffee shops and sandwich chains and was largely confined to London. The technology received a huge boost four years ago when it became possible for people travelling on the tube and most of London transport using a contactless card, rather than tickets or Oyster smartcards. But contactless been held back by people worrying about falling victim to fraud.Figures from UK Finance showed money lost to fraud on contactless cards almost doubled to £5.6m in the first six months of 2017, from £2.9m a year earlier, overtaking the £5.3m lost from cheque fraud."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aab5ba21016f397ca616ecf1f248c5e1c5aeae56/0_66_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=339b75ab7ce30bc9c1a79bc564ef97ad","title":"uk pension funds get green light to dump fossil fuel investments","story":"Government directive means trustees will be able to push harder for green investmentsManagers of the £1.5tn invested in Britain’sworkplace pension schemes are to be given new powers to dump shares in oil, gas and coal companies in favour of long-term investment in green and “social impact” opportunities.Government proposals published on Monday are designed to give pension fund trustees more confidence to est from environmentally damaging fossil fuels and put their cash in green alternatives if it meets their members’ wishes. Until now many pension trustees have been hamstrung by fiduciary duties that they feel requires them to seek the best returns irrespective of the threat of climate change.The new rules, though couched in opaque legalese, are a coded go-ahead for pension funds to sell shares in fossil fuel companies if they believe that they could turn into “stranded assets”. The term refers to companies’ coal, oil and gas deposits that may not ever be monetised as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy. In the paper published on Monday, Clarifying and Strengthening Trustees’ Investment Duties, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: “Our proposed regulations are intended to reassure trustees that they can (and indeed should) take account of financially material risks, whether these stem from investee firms’ traditional financial reporting, or from broader risks covered in non-financial reporting or elsewhere.”Environmental campaigners reckon that investments amounting to trillions of dollars in fossil fuels – coal mines, oil wells, power stations, conventional vehicles – will lose their value when the world moves decisively to a low-carbon economy. They believe that fossil fuel reserves and production facilities will become stranded assets, having absorbed capital but are unable to be used to make a profit. This carbon bubble has been estimated at between $1tn (£753m) and $4tn, a large chunk of the global economy’s balance sheet.But the DWP warned that the new rules do not give carte blanche for activist groups to bully pension funds into selling out of fossil fuels. “These proposals are not intended to give any support to activist groups for boycotts or estment from certain assets,” the DWP paper said. “Trustees have primacy in investment decisions and, whilst they should not necessarily rule out the ability to take account of members’ views, they are never obliged to, and the prime focus is to deliver a return to members.”Unison, the public sector union, launched a campaign in January to encourage local government pension funds – which have invested £16bn in the fossil fuel industry – to est from carbon.The new rules, subject to a consultation period, have been brought forward by secretary of state for work and pensions, Esther McVey. “As we see the younger generation care more about where their money is going, they are also increasingly questioning that their pensions are invested in a way that aligns with their values,” she said. “This money can now be used to build a more sustainable, fairer and equal society for future generations.”Climate change campaigners said they were delighted at the proposals. Bethan Livesey, head of policy at ShareAction, said: “ShareAction has been pushing for changes to these regulations for years.“Pension schemes seem to fall into three camps: those who understand the financial value of taking ESG factors seriously and do so, those who say they understand but do very little and those who have no clue. These changes to the regulations should at the very least enlighten the third group.”A growing number of UK and European insurance companies have started selling holdings in coal companies and refusing to insure their operations. More than £15bn has been ested by insurers including Allianz, Aviva, Axa, Legal \u0026amp General, Swiss Re and Zurich in the past two years, according to Unfriend Coal Network, a global coalition of NGOs and campaigners including 350.org and Greenpeace.Last week Legal \u0026amp General said it would exclude China Construction Bank, Russia’s Rosneft, the Japanese carmaker Subaru and five other companies that have failed to act on climate change from its Future World Fund.The Rockefeller Family Fund, a charitable fund of the Rockefeller family, which made its fortune from Standard Oil, has started esting from fossil fuel holdings. However, Cambridge University has just ruled out esting from oil and gas in its £6.3bn endowment fund – despite public pressure from hundreds of academics and a hunger strike by three undergraduates. Cambridge said it had no direct investment in fossil fuel companies and wanted to avoid any direct investment in coal and tar sands, while keeping indirect investment to a minimum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b50b94905430eb7afd56db47e0ae2a9e57b228cc/0_9_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e0683f19a6945ce1e489747df228df6","title":"virgin money bought clydesdale bank cybg","story":"£1.7bn deal creates UK’s sixth-largest bank with 6 million customers and 9,500 staffMore than 1,500 jobs, mainly senior management posts, are to be axed in the £1.7bn takeover of Virgin Money by the owner of Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks. Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG) and Virgin Money have agreed to create the UK’s sixth-largest bank, with 6 million personal and small business customers and total lending of £70bn. However, the plan is to retain Virgin Money’s head office in Gosforth, Newcastle, for at least three years. Its chief executive, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, who has led the bank for more than 10 years, will become a senior adviser to the CYBG boss David Duffy, who will take the reins of the combined company.Duffy said: “It’s a pretty historic day for CYBG and Virgin Money.” He added that the combined company would offer the full scale of products and services, combining Virgin Money’s strength in mortgages, credit cards and investments with CYBG’s small and mid-sized business banking business.CYBG is paying 1.2125 new shares in exchange for each Virgin Money share. Based on Friday’s closing price of 306p, this values each Virgin Money share at 371p.CYBG will quickly adopt the Virgin Money brand for personal banking, before testing it with small and medium-sized business customers. The rebranding will cost £60m CYBG has agreed to license the Virgin Money brand for £12m a year initially, going up to £15m in the fourth year. The deal brings together the UK’s two largest challenger banks, creating the first true national competitor to the big five.Nick Cooper of branding consultancy Landor said: “The Virgin Money brand is perceived as entirely different to other banks and that’s why it’s the right one to take forward. When this deal is complete it will give Virgin Money the scale that it currently lacks and could propel the brand into a position from where it can really challenge the established high street lenders.”After the recent fiasco at TSB caused by a botched IT migration, CYBG stressed that there would be no “big bang” move of Virgin Money customers to its platform on day one. The transfer will be phased over three years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00bda917c5aeee9942d1958973c58be2e0d67b6c/0_558_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3b8f7043ea570449f6afa568c80e04e","title":"beyond stonehenge the cities built to celebrate the sun","story":"During Thursday’s solstice, stone circles and ancient monuments will be the focus of attention. Should we be looking to Milton Keynes or New York instead?During Thursday’s solstice, stone circles and ancient monuments will be the focus of attention. Should we be looking to Milton Keynes or New York instead?So who’s heading to Milton Keynes to mark the summer solstice this year? Don’t scoff so quickly. It’s true that when it comes to equinox and solstice-watching, we tend to think first and foremost about ancient sites, from the pyramids of Giza to Angkor Wat. For the British, all eyes turn towards Stonehenge, where, viewed from the centre of the stone circle at dawn, the sun rises directly above the Heel stone in more or less perfect alignment. But do you really want to be a part of what English Heritage, doing its bureaucratic best to get into the vibe, is calling Summer Solstice Managed Open Access? Me neither. Stonehenge? Stonehasbeen more like.Milton Keynes may once have evoked images of suburban dystopia with endless roundabouts, concrete cows and grey-faced commuters waiting for the 07:22 to Euston, but there’s another side to MK. If you don’t fancy hanging with patchouli-scented pagans, wildly dressed wiccans, staff-bearing druids, new age spiritualists and red-eyed stoners at Stonehenge, then this carefully planned town might offer a more original spot in which to worship the rising sun on the longest day of the year. For hidden among its many distinctions (22 million trees and shrubs, 20,000 parking spaces, 130 roundabouts, home to WD-40 lubricant production) is the sensational secret that it was actually designed as “a mystic portal to a higher realm”. Who knew?It turns out that the eastern end of Midsummer Boulevard, which runs south-west to north-east from the train station, past a Holiday Inn, a Jobcentre Plus, the Centre:MK shopping mall, the Yong Yu Chinese supermarket, the Post Office and ending at Milton Keynes theatre, is perfectly aligned with the rising sun on summer solstice. Having consulted Greenwich Observatory on the precise coordinates required to bring this about, the town’s architects encouraged the engineers to shift the urban grid a few degrees. Job done. One solstice they celebrated with an all-night bonfire, tunes from Pink Floyd and suitable quantities of marijuana – this was the 70s, after all. But just as Brits can claim no monopoly on the sun in our low-skied, grey-clouded land, so ancient humans all over the world refashioned their own built environments to mark and celebrate important solar moments in the calendar.A recent study by the Italian archaeoastronomer Giulio Magli suggested that Alexandria’s main east-west Canopic Way may have been built deliberately to align with the sun on Alexander the Great’s birthday. Ireland has Newgrange, a staggering Neolithic monument built around 3,200BC, giving it boasting rights over both Stonehenge and the pyramids of Giza, which were built later. Each winter solstice the rising sun enters through the “roofbox” within the great, grassed mound, which is considered part passage tomb and part temple, and for around 17 minutes bathes the inner chamber in a breathtaking fulgor of light. Last year the event was livestreamed for the first time on 21 December, but sadly the sun failed to show up.The Mayans knew a thing or two about the movement of the sun too. Their mastery of maths and astronomy is seen to spectacular effect in the Pyramid of Kukulkan, which dominates the centre of the pre-Columbian city of Chichen Itza on Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula. Built around AD1000, it has 91 steps on each of its four faces, the final temple on its summit giving a total of 365, the number of days in the Mayan year. The pyramid also appears to have been constructed to produce a stunning visual effect. At sunset on every spring and autumn equinox, light slants across the stepped pyramid and creates a snakelike shadow that for around five hours slowly steals its way down the structure in what is quite possibly a solar tribute to the feathered snake god Kukulkan, whose likeness is sculpted across the monument.12th-century temple at Angkor Wat in Cambodia discovered in 1976 that onlookers standing by the western entrance gate on the spring equinox see the sun rise directly over the top of the central tower. It seemed, in Nasa’s words, that the architect had “encoded calendrical, historical and cosmological themes into his architectural plan for the temple”.The summer solstice by definition transcends borders, religions, ethnicities. It unites rather than ides. Reassuringly, it harks back to a time long before Hinduism and Buddhism had entered the world’s consciousness, far earlier than the three great Abrahamic faiths that ided the planet’s population into rival God-fearing monotheists. In our endlessly, celestially revolving world the solstice demands a moment of stillness and reflection. Its very etymology – from the Latin sol (sun) and sistere (to stand still) – indicates that almost miraculous point of transition, sandwiched between cycles of movement, when the sun appears from Earth to have reached its most northerly or southerly excursion relative to the celestial equator and then, after “standing still”, reverses course. It is the longest day, the triumph of the sun, a celebration of midsummer and a marker that the days will start to shorten. For a fleeting moment the entire year is on hold, a moment of flux and suspense beautifully caught in Margaret Atwood’s Solstice Poem:This is the solstice, the still pointof the sun, its cusp and midnight,the year’s thresholdand unlocking, where the pastlets go of and becomes the futurethe place of caught breath, the doorof a vanished house left ajar.The summer solstice once marked the beginning of calendars, the season of harvest, the ancient middle of summer: a time to celebrate fertility and the life-giving strength of the sun in a pre-industrial environment. In today’s less rural world, for many people that ancient connection with the cycle of nature has been lost. Yet our fascination with the solstice remains curiously undimmed, as though deeply embedded in our ancestral memory. Perhaps, then, it is not altogether surprising that hidden within the urban fabric of the world’s cities are solstice-friendly streets aligned with sunrise and sunset on the summer and winter solstices.There can surely be few more dedicated urban solstice sleuths than Demeter Sztanko, a Ukrainian data engineer based in London. He says after getting into conversations “too often” about druids, freemasons and streets aligned towards the solstice, he decided to use his data-mining talents to create “a tool that helps to find out the truth. As I work in data analysis and love maps, that sounded like a great idea.” The result is his painstaking list On Solstices and City Planning, a compilation of 694 cities worldwide that contain streets thus aligned. Streets that run broadly south-west to north-east are aligned with summer solstice sunrises and winter solstice sunsets. Those that run south-east to north-west correspond to summer solstice sunsets and winter solstice sunrises. Europe contains the largest number of such cities (226), followed by North America (168), Asia (131) and Africa (55). Sztanko is confident he has logged every city on the planet. “It is pure math,” he says. “I am using OpenStreetMap as the primary geodata provider, which is like Wikipedia for maps, free, open-source and accurate.”The UK has 21 cities on Sztanko’s list, mostly the largest ones like London, Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Newcastle, Sheffield, Liverpool and Leeds. There may be a clue here in these cities’ sheer size. In other words, in vast, sprawling cities it may be inevitable that some streets are solstice-friendly.Tantalisingly, the jury is still out on the million-dollar question. Are these selected streets in 694 cities laid out like this by accident or design? Sztanko says he is still trying to find out. He is receiving so many emails from all over the world that he is “overwhelmed by the interest” in his site.Disappointingly for Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire’s greatest “new town” does not make the list, even after a direct appeal from the . Sztanko says his calculations are based on half the sun being visible, which may explain the absence of Midsummer Boulevard from his compilation. Be that as it may, summer solstice in Milton Keynes will be on Thursday 21 June at 11:07. No druids expected.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f30c0855ac50610925335f99a4544c2c2b1deaa/37_4_4859_2916/master/4859.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e0e69966f5b1e6ad59405fff6ca0b28","title":"from scandi fika to jamaican jerk how to travel the world without leaving the uk","story":"From Cantonese cuisine in Manchester to Italian gardens in Wales, soak up the UK’s rich culture and you can feel like a globetrotter wherever you areAs an island nation, the UK has never been short of visiting adventurers and settlers seeking a different place to call home. Over the years different communities have established homes away from home around the country – Little Italys, Chinatowns, Balti Triangles and more. Stay in an Airbnb at the heart of these communities, get local tips from your host, and experience interesting slices of world culture, without leaving the UK. Here’s where to kick off your tour of some of the little nations on the UK’s doorstep.Channel your inner ScandiIkea, Noma and Pernille Teisbaek all have their part to play in the UK’s obsession with Scandi-inspired interiors, food, fashion and, well, just about everything – and our love affair shows no sign of waning. Whether you’re in Manchester’s Northern Quarter or Bristol’s up-and-coming Montpelier neighbourhood, it is possible to find little pockets of Copenhagen or Stockholm in a growing number of UK cities. The Scandinavian population of London is also on the up, with favourite Scandi hangouts clustered around the Marylebone area, near to the Swedish church. Here, you can unwind over fika – a coffee and bun break – at the Nordic Bakery, where you can also pick up rye bread and other treats. Head to Totally Swedish for food and other knick-knacks, which are, yes, totally Swedish. Or try Scandi Kitchen to buy sweets and snacks or ingredients to prepare back in your Airbnb.Search for homes on Airbnb near stylish Marylebone, LondonTravel to Belgium via FifeFife, on the east coast of Scotland has long been known for its beauty, but very few people are aware that it is home to Flemish architectural gems – some of which you can stay in. Stand beside the 17th-century houses in Pittenweem harbour and it will look like you’re in Belgium – the steeped gables and pantile roofs will give your photos a feel that is not typically Scottish. At the end of your architecture trawl, head to the village of Crail where boats will be bringing in their catch of crabs and lobster – at the Lobster Hut you can buy them cooked and dressed and eat alfresco on the harbour wall. Get there early if you don’t want to miss out on the lobster or crab rolls.Search for homes on Airbnb in Flemish-inspired FifeFall in love with the City of LightsBlackpool Tower, built between 1891 and 1894, was originally inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, but these days it is more famously known as the place where the television show Strictly Come Dancing comes to put on a grand display. Get a snap of yourself holding the tower in the palm of your hand by posing farther down the promenade and then return to the famous ballroom to try out your waltz, paso doble and cha-cha-cha. Cap it all off with some kitsch souvenirs – a kiss-me-quick hat or a stick of Blackpool rock. And as the sun goes down – and if you are visiting between 31 August and 4 November – walk along the beachfront during the Blackpool Illumination, for a dazzling display of lights.Search for homes on Airbnb near the bright lights of BlackpoolGo back in time to Roman EnglandEngland’s most famous wall, dating back to the 2nd century, once marked the distinction between north and south. Now a Unesco world heritage site, and one of England’s greatest landmarks, Hadrian’s Wall threads along almost 80 miles from coast to coast, running from the river Tyne to the Solway Firth. It is the best-preserved frontier of the Roman empire, which ruled much of England for almost 400 years. Along the wall you will find the Roman town of Corbridge, and Roman temples and forts – as well as some incredible homes to stay in.Search for homes on Airbnb in historic NorthumberlandFind Little JamaicaWant to get your jerk on? Then look no farther than London’s Brixton, with a thriving Jamaican community, who’ve been in the area for seven decades. It’s here that you can get that hit of herbs and spices on the barbecue, as long-marinated chicken, pork and goat sizzle on the grill. You’ll find music all around you as you wander between boutiques and food emporiums, with Jamaican flags at every turn. Head to Bamboula or Negril for authentic saltfish with ackee (a buttery tasting fruit), or festival (cornmeal dumplings), and later after a night on the tiles, Refill serves up everything from stew made from cow foot and beans, to callaloo dumplings (made with a leafy vegetable) until the early hours.Search for homes on Airbnb near London’s cool BrixtonExperience Manchester’s ChinatownStand under the famous arch in Chinatown, Manchester, and you could almost be in any major city in China.

Head to south London’s Stockwell area, where you will find cafes and restaurants serving Portuguese food. There is a huge Portuguese community in this part of London – the largest outside the country itself. Check out Madeira cafe, which sells cakes and pastries, and has a bakery that makes 20,000 pastéis de nata per day, to be sent out across London. Or head to Sintra delicatessen, which sells everything from Portuguese sweets to cheeses and chorizo sausages.

Sofia Genders, co-founder of End of the Road Festival and Sheffield insider, has your ultimate 48-hour guide to the cityDay one – yoga, shopping and arty hangoutsExplore what Sheffield’s buzzing neighbourhoods have to offer. Spend the morning getting to know the hip, leafy suburb of Nether Edge – start with a yoga class at Hot Yoga Sheffield on Edgedale Road, then grab a healthy smoothie at the Wild Leaf cafe next door. Yoga was such a great stress-buster when I was running End of the Road festival, and it never fails to put me in a great frame of mind, whether I’m working or enjoying a day off.Next, take a stroll to nearby Abbeydale Road, also known as the antiques quarter. On the first Sunday of the month this vintage wonderland of a street also hosts a flea market at the Abbeydale Picture House – a gorgeous old venue that regularly screens black-and-white early cinema and hosts various cultural events. Spend some time wandering around the Vaults to find something special among the weird and wonderful retro items, or try the eclectic Rileys \u0026amp Co for vintage furniture, kitsch collectables and local crafts. I also love finding bargains in charity shops – there are quite a few along Abbeydale Road. Sticking with the retro theme, a visit to Jameson’s Cafe \u0026amp Tea Rooms is my all-time favourite afternoon tea spot, with great service and a live pianist. Two minutes walk down the road, there’s a great secondhand record store called Below. Also close by on Nether Edge Road, is the intimate and laid back Cafe #9 – perfect for a pick-me-up, plus they host live music now and again.As the afternoon rolls on, head to the villagey Sharrow Vale Road, where you can browse independent shops, delis and boutiques – such as the Front Parlour or Porter Book Shop – before grabbing an artisan doughnut and coffee from Eve Kitchen.If you need something more substantial, you could grab a late lunch from Porter Pizza on Sharrow Vale Road, probably the best pizza in town. It’s takeaway-only but the gorgeous Endcliffe Park is just around the corner, and is a top spot for a pizza picnic and a quick post-lunch stroll around the beautiful woodland.Alternatively, hop in a cab to Chesterfield Road in the up-and-coming Meersbrook area. Here, vegans are in luck: Make No Bones restaurant on Chesterfield Road is a true local’s favourite, or Just Falafs, on the same street, is a great fallback. That’s not to say that carnivores aren’t also well catered for in the area. I also really love the Tramshed Bar \u0026amp Kitchen – they’ve got a brilliant Asian menu, or you could just pop into the bar for a drink or two.Speaking of drinks, in the evening, Takk bar on Queens Road, Heeley, right on the edge of Sheffield city centre, is a great place for a dance and a cocktail in a fairy lit garden. You’ll find it in Hagglers Corner, a creative courtyard community of artists and independent makers, which doubles as an arts venue. If pubs are more your thing, the Brothers Arms and the Sheaf View are both nearby and have a reputation for top quality real ale.If you’re after a gig, try the Audacious Art Experiment, the eponymous venue of the local record label, on Harwood Street. Alternatively, head back to Abbeydale Road and check out Picture House Social, for an eclectic line-up of music events, with great cocktails, craft beer, Italian-inspired street food and a games room, too. I’m a big fan of small, independent venues with creative programming as they’re vital to a healthy music industry – both are destinations for the in-the-know crowd and have some great shows on.Day two – coffee, cake and creative curationThe second day is when you’ll find out what the city centre has to offer, plus a visit to Kelham Island, a riverside area that was once the central hub of Sheffield’s industry, and one of the oldest sites of its kind in the city.Start your day with a good coffee. There are so many great places to choose from, depending on where you are based. Tamper is a New Zealand coffee place with an industrial feel – its main outpost is housed in a 19th-century former silversmith workshop on Arundel Street. On the same street is the Holt, a true hidden gem of a coffee place, while tucked away on Aberdeen Court is Steam Yard, with a cosy feel and amazing cakes.Spend the rest of your morning checking out some of the best shops the city has to offer – in particular stroll along Division Street and the surrounding roads. Syd and Mallory sells the best handmade clothing and reworked fashion. La Biblioteka is a great little bookshop stocking a massive range of magazines and books from independent publishers, plus stationery. When I’m looking for good music, I often discover something new and fresh at Bear Tree Records – a lovely shop that sells both new and secondhand vinyl.While you wander, keep your eyes peeled. Sheffield is full of great street art, sculpture, graffiti and wall murals by local artists such as Jo Peel, Faunagraphic, Phlegm and more. Street Art Sheffield lists many of the sites if you’d like to plan ahead. One of my favourite sculptures is the Women of Steel by Martin Jennings outside City Hall. It commemorates the women who worked in the city’s steel industry during the first and second world wars.After a morning stroll, stop for lunch at Dina Diner, a vegetarian and vegan cafe attached to a music, comedy, poetry and theatre venue that is a social enterprise and platform for emerging artists. Dina is an example of what I like about most of Sheffield’s creative spaces: the really thoughtful curation. Similarly, Gloam Gallery is another great space dedicated to creativity. Gloam’s Instagram is exciting and exhibitions here are fresh and unusual. In September, the Site Gallery will also be re-opening – another great creative space to check out.For dinner head to Kelham Island and the cosy, neighbourhood restaurant Stew and Oyster. Later in the evening, check out the Delicious Clam – a record label and an unmissable DIY venue where you’re guaranteed to hear something interesting and underground. A lot of bands start out there and it’s worth catching a show if you can. Something entirely different is Public, a recently-opened cocktail bar in a converted old public toilet – it’s another small venue, and really worth it.Last but not least, be sure to check out what is one of the best railway station pubs in the country – the Sheffield Tap, a place where my husband and I love to sit and watch the world go by. Located within the old first-class waiting room, this pub is also a microbrewery and has a great selection of craft beers.

In fact, with its fixie bikes, cobbled streets, Noma-ish foraged cuisine and design-first ethos, it almost feels like a pocket of Copenhagen that just happens to be a 90-minute train ride from London. Throw in the refurbished 1920s theme park Dreamland and it all adds up to an irresistible artist’s enclave for a weekend city. Armed with effusive recommendations from my Airbnb host Clare – a trend-forecaster and trainee florist ­– I set about experiencing the best of the Kentish coast’s new capital of cool. Here’s my guide to getting the best out of a trip to this unique seaside town.Follow the foodie trailThe seafront chippies are still drawing crowds (and e-bombing seagulls) but in recent years, Margate’s culinary scene has evolved. Open since 2015, Hantverk \u0026amp Found is a seafood cafe and gallery that exemplifies that uptick in quality, whether you’re after a big last-night-of-the-trip dinner or a casual lunch slurping local rock oysters spiked with yuzu (a citrus fruit) in the suntrap garden. The food is unfussy and brightly flavoured – think clams in a spicy Korean broth and bream with a heady brown shrimp butter. The dinky emerald-tiled room adds a lively, squashed-in thrum to proceedings.For a legendary cheese toastie, and great rooftop views for sunset, head to Cheesy Tiger on the jutting Harbour Arm, my Airbnb host advises. There’s also friendly little Fez bar, a quirky, eclectic boozer close by. Or for an array of beachfront eating and drinking options, then the The Bus Cafe – with its crammed and zingy salad wraps – and the adjacent Sun Deck, are the places to head to. “There’s a really good juice bar, Po’ Boy that does great Creole-style food, and a cool tiki bar,” says Ed Warren, local and co-founder of Cliffs record shop and cafe.Sound out local musicThere aren’t many cafes where you can watch an experimental radio show broadcasting to the world and have a flat white made by a double Mercury Music prize-winning nominee. A labour of love for musician Obara Ejimiwe (aka Ghostpoet) and his creative director wife Kate, Radio Margate is a hybrid coffee shop, late-night venue and internet radio station launched in 2017 following their move from London. This sea-view space – all calming jazz and tasteful mid-century furniture – is, according to the Ejimiwes, a direct result of Margate’s contagious creative energy. “It’s totally infectious and there’s more room here to develop strong, independent ideas,” Obara says.Housed in a lovingly restored former 1920s tearoom in Cliftonville, Cliffs is a record shop that also encompasses a fitness studio, coffee roastery, hair salon, gig venue and an exceptional cafe (try the harissa oil and avocado toast). “I just wanted to sell Motown records but we got caught up in it all, like a lot of people here do,” says owner Ed Warren, explaining how he and his interior designer partner Kier Muddiman found themselves presiding over this artfully-distressed cultural fiefdom. “All these interesting little places in Margate are from the heart, basically.”Hit refreshWalpole Bay tidal pool is a must for lovers of outdoor swimming. It is the UK’s largest saltwater bathing pool, covering 4 acres (1.6 hectares), and was built in 1937. A group of locals swear by a regular swim in this beautiful coastal location, which fills up at high tide each day. “The first time I jumped in I squealed with excitement as the cold water engulfed me,” says Kathryn Ferguson, Margate resident and director of Taking the Waters, a short film about the pool. “But it felt exhilarating and from that moment I was totally hooked. A full moon swim is something I’d recommend everyone to try once.”Sticking with the theme of wellness, it’s worth stopping by natural fragrance and skincare company Haeckels to pick up a few restorative products to take home. One of the town’s most famous success stories, it was founded by Dom Bridges, a former film director who turned a hobby making soap from foraged Margate seaweed into a brand stocked in Harvey Nichols. Still, little can prepare you for the surprise of its flagship laboratory, shop and sea-based thalassotherapy spa, high up on a blustery Cliftonville parade. “It’s an example of the fact that each business has an amazing story of its own,” says Shelly Keeys, owner of shrewdly curated local fashion store Ruskin.Shop independent art and designThose that know their parlour palms from their succulents will feel at home in the jungle interior of Mar Mar, a cafe, gift shop and houseplant emporium on Northdown Road. Bolstering the town’s roster of design boutiques (homewares store Môr is worth a look too), it grew from Central St Martins graduate Boe Holder’s bold, Memphis Group-influenced creations. “She used to do pot painting and sell these great plant pots online,” says Margate-based photographer Harriet Bentley. “Now they’re selling plants, coffee, magazines and other great little things. It’s so cool.”Other interiors shops worth seeking out include: Clayspace Studios, a social enterprise and ceramics store Danish Collectables for curated Scandinavian vintage pieces Papillon Interiors for vibrant indoor and outdoor furniture and Imagineican Store, a tiny design and lifestyle studio. If you hire a bike during your trip, Westgate-on-sea is about a 15-minute cycle from Margate’s seafront, and is home to Eighty Two Westgate.Of course, one of the biggest draws in town for art is the Turner Contemporary, which opened in 2011 and sowed the first seeds for the current regenerative flowering.

This will potentially inflict a huge financial and emotional toll on the half million Americans who live in the properties at risk of having their basements, backyards, garages or living rooms inundated every other week.“The impact could well be staggering,” said Kristina Dahl, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). “This level of flooding would be a tipping point where people in these communities would think it’s unsustainable.“Even homes along the Gulf coast that are elevated would be affected, as they’d have to drive through salt water to get to work or face their kids’ school being cut off. You can imagine people walking away from mortgages, away from their homes.”The UCS used federal data from a high sea level rise scenario projected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and combined it with property data from the online real estate company Zillow to quantify the level of risk across the lower 48 states.Under this scenario, where planet-warming emissions are barely constrained and the seas rise by around 6.5ft globally by the end of the century, 311,000 homes along the US coastline would face flooding on average 26 times a year within the next 30 years – a typical life for a new mortgage.The losses would multiply by the end of the century, with the research warning that as many as 2.4m homes, worth around a trillion dollars, could be put at risk. Low-lying states would be particularly prone, with a million homes in Florida, 250,000 homes in New Jersey and 143,000 homes in New York at risk of chronic flooding by 2100.This persistent flooding is likely to rattle the housing market by lowering property prices and making mortgages untenable in certain areas. Flood insurance premiums could rise sharply, with people faced with the choice of increasing clean-up costs or retreating to higher ground inland.“Unfortunately, in the years ahead many coastal communities will face declining property values as risk perceptions catch up with reality,” said Rachel Cleetus, an economist and climate policy director at UCS. “In contrast with previous housing market crashes, values of properties chronically inundated due to sea level rise are unlikely to recover and will only continue to go further underwater, literally and figuratively.”The report does not factor in future technological advances that could ameliorate the impact of rising seas, although the US would be starting from a relatively low base compared to some countries given that it does not have a national sea level rise plan. And the current Trump administration has moved to erase the looming issue from consideration for federally-funded infrastructure.The oceans are rising by around 3mm a year due to the thermal expansion of seawater that’s warming because of the burning of fossil fuels by humans. The melting of massive glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica is also pushing up the seas – Nasa announced last week that the amount of ice lost annually from Antarctica has tripled since 2012 to an enormous 241bn tons a year.This slowly unfolding scenario is set to pose wrenching choices for many in the US. Previous research has suggested that around 13 million Americans may have to move due to sea level rise by the end of the century, with landlocked states such as Arizona and Wyoming set for a population surge.“My flood insurance bill just went up by $100 this year, it went up $100 the year before,” said Philip Stoddard, the mayor of South Miami. “People on the waterfront won’t be able to stay unless they are very wealthy. This isn’t a risk, it’s inevitable.“Miami is a beautiful and interesting place to live – I’m looking at a lizard on my windowsill right now. But people will face a cost to live here that will creep up and up. At some point they will have to make a rational economic decision and they may relocate. Some people will make the trade-off to live here. Some won’t.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2661222f2f693bbd4582936d78d99aa1416273ba/0_262_2686_3968/master/2686.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a8a0a5f532202d6dcf8ea086564dafa0 1440w","title":"brazil tite switzerland equaliser ruled out","story":"• Tite: ‘You have to be fair. There was a foul’• Switzerland’s Xherdan Shaqiri: ‘This was a normal challenge’Tite complained bitterly that Switzerland’s equalising goal ought to have been ruled out for a foul, as Brazil could only draw 1-1 on their opening night in Group E.The five-times champions had led through Philippe Coutinho’s beautiful long-range curling goal but Steven Zuber equalised early in the second half. The Switzerland midfielder pushed Miranda slightly before he headed home from Xherdan Shaqiri’s corner and Tite argued it had been a “clear” offence.The Brazil striker Gabriel Jesus believed he should have had a penalty in the 74th minute after he felt Manuel Akanji’s arms around him in the area but the equalising goal was the principal talking point.“I will also say this – Miranda said to me: ‘Well, when he pushed me, I should have fallen over,’ but I said: ‘No, absolutely not. Don’t simulate anything. Don’t draw a foul otherwise it will look like you are trying to do so.’”Switzerland emerged with their point after what was largely a rearguard action and they dismissed the controversy over their goal. The manager, Vladimir Petkovic, said: “It was a regular goal, a regular duel. You look to create space to have the opportunity. The defender was not well positioned. The VAR referees also keep an eye on proceedings.”Shaqiri added: “It is too much to say it’s a foul in every game when you have some little touches. This is football. You cannot stay without the little touches. Yes, many pushes are a foul but this was a normal challenge on a corner. It is no foul.”Brazil were the more proactive team and they dominated in terms of chances created but they were undermined by a lack of ruthlessness. “There was a lot of anxiety, a lot of pressure and it was translated into the final action,” Tite said. “We had more than 20 finishes but too many were off target. If we were more focused, we could have made the goalkeeper work more.“After the equaliser you could feel something emotionally. There was a feeling. We had to be cooler, more precise. My expectation was for a victory and, of course, I’m not happy with the result.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37c85be15668f715b8721d5de047bd98b83e52a8/0_165_4935_2961/master/4935.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=954881eb68d6ec0f87306748c87bc5dc","title":"mexican fans set off earthquake sensors celebrating world cup win","story":"Supporters in Mexico City watching Germany game cause two ‘artificial’ quakes during their team’s surprise winMexicans jumping in jubilation on Sunday shook the ground hard enough to set off earthquake detectors after their team scored a surprise victory over World Cup defending champions Germany.The Institute of Geological and Atmospheric Investigations said highly sensitive earthquake sensors registered tremors at two sites in Mexico City, seven seconds after the game’s 35th minute, when star player Hirving Lozano scored. It called the tremors an “artificial” quake. Fans waving Mexican flags and wearing traditional “sombrero” hats, gathered at the iconic Angel of Independence monument in downtown Mexico City, to watch the match on on a giant screen in front of a towering cathedral. As Mexico beat Germany 1-0 in Moscow, they sang the country’s unofficial soccer anthem, “Cielito Lindo,” or “Pretty Little Sky,” a popular folksong. At the Angel of Independence monument after the match, Rodolfo Pulido, 47, led a chant of “Mexico! Mexico! Mexico!” perched on a concrete barrier that usually separates traffic on a busy thoroughfare. “I am incredibly happy,” said Pulido, with his girlfriend and son on a Father’s Day outing. “It’s a double gift: Mexico won and I get to celebrate with my son.” He also said he could now dream of Mexico reaching the next stage along with 15 other teams, getting a shot at reaching the quarter- and semi-finals before the final match. “El Tri,” as the team is called, in homage to Mexico’s three-colour flag, has failed make it to the round of 16 in the last six World Cups. Presidential front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador offered his congratulations at a campaign event in Mexico state, telling supporters, “Just like the team won today, Mexico will keep winning.” Fans on social media celebrated goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa’s performance, circulating memes depicting him as president of Mexico. Others riffed on US president Donald Trump’s pledge to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico, placing photos of Ochoa guarding the goal alongside the caption “Hey! We already have a wall.” Another popular meme depicted German chancellor, Angela Merkel, holding a phone to her ear with the text: “Donald? It’s me Angela.

The decision not to award Argentina’s Christian Pavon a penalty against Iceland was particularly baffling. But VAR is getting it right more often than not. And for all the wailing on social media, the penalty awarded to Antoine Griezmann was a textbook example of how it should work – a clear error spotted, the referee alerted and the decision reversed after it became clear Griezmann was spiked.Our gallery of the best images of the World Cup so far has some absolute crackers, but this is my absolute favourite. It’s just a stunning photograph, cheapened only by the fact that Neymar was wildly overacting in a successful bid to win his opponent a booking.Some of these alternative Panini stickers are absolutely great:The Colombian Wilmar Roldan will meanwhile take charge of England’s game. He is best known for his performance in officiating River Plate’s Copa Libertadores game against Lanus late last year, which was described in commentary as “scandalous and painful”.Refwatch: Zambia’s Janny Sikazwe will be the man in the middle when Belgium play Panama today. A couple of years ago he took charge of the Cosafa Cup final between South Africa and Botswana, at the end of which the Botswana coach, Peter Butler, had this to say about him:I’d just like too say that this tournament will never ever gain any leverage or credibility when we have atrocious and disgusting and shameful refereeing decisions – not just tonight but throughout that tournament.This is the same guy that sent me off, the same guy that gave a penalty against us the last time and he’s given two penalties tonight. We were the better team for the majority of the game.Good luck to South Africa, I wish them well, but I think it’s disgusting and it’s shameful.But hey, we all have our off days.Barney Ronay’s piece on Russia’s role in his family history is excellently readable:There is a time and place for first-person stories, which is usually no time and no place. But this is the only time I’ll get to tell this one. It’s quite good. And it relates to Russia, Volgograd, and preconceptions. On this day in World Cup history: Diego Maradona scores his first World Cup goal. And his second.And so another day of World Cup-based excitement begins (if you share my time zone). I’m expecting another cracker. Today features press conferences from Australia, Mexico, Portugal, Iceland, France, Uruguay, Russia, Poland, Switzerland and Argentina, plus three actual matches and a whole world of fun. I’ll be here for the next eight hours or so. Strap yourself in and enjoy the ride!And with that, I’ll leave you with my esteemed colleague, Simon Burnton, who’ll occupy the hot seat until Sweden and South Korea kick off in Novogorod. From me though, until next time.Some glorious snaps have been taken so far in Russia, although it’s going to be hard to beat this one even though we might have been duped into liking it:Some great lines from Robert Lewandowski in this exclusive interview with Tomasz Wlodarczyk, including these:“There have been many attempts of dishonesty. Even fake charity proposals. The number of strange offers is absolutely astonishing and, because of that, I have become distrusting of people. No one becomes my friend in one day. I have many doubts and my first thought these days, sadly, is: ‘This person wants something from me.’ But even if I weren’t famous, it wouldn’t be that easy to get close to me. I have my old friends and I keep them very close to myself. I know who I can trust. I don’t change my friends like socks. When there is someone I think I may like, I can open the door, but I do it very slowly. Trust has to be there before I open my heart.”The Socceroos’ World Cup hopes hang in the balance after their controversial defeat to France, and captain Mile Jedinak, who scored Australia’s penalty in the 2-1 defeat in Kazan, knows there’s a touch of the last-chance saloon about the game against Denmark – lose and they’re out. “We can’t lose again,” Jedinak said. “Everyone knows what is at stake, no one is kidding themselves ... we have got to get a result. And you have got to control all that emotion and try and stick to what is being asked of you and not stray away too much.”More from Diego Maradona, speaking on Venezuelan television channel Telesur:Four days in, and we’ve had the first instance of World Cup espionage, and surprisingly it didn’t involved a drone – or indeed anything more ingenious than a Swedish coach walking into a training session which he claims he thought was open. (It wasn’t.) It prompted an apology from Sweden manager Janne Andersson, but he stopped short of responding to allegations the coach in question, Lars Jacobsson, had rented a house across the road from South Korea’s training ground. The Koreans, meanwhile, attempted to confuse the alleged spy by swapping their players’ numbers around.Oof, Daryl John Boyce writes in to point out an earlier clanger. “Didn’t Southgate miss at Euro 96?” Consider him stricken from the list of (World Cup) shame, and feel free to add in Pearce, Waddle, Ince, Batty, Lampard, Gerrard or Carragher instead, if we still need an England presence.With the weight of a nation of World Cup players’ shoulders, you’d hardly think they’d need any more pressure. But for South Korean players, including Son Heung-min, a good showing on the pitch could get them out of doing military service – and cutting their hair, living on a pittance and learning to eat instant noodles at a speed that would win gold if such a thing were an Olympic event.Speaking of El Diego, whether he’s missing in penalty shootouts or staring wide-eyed down television cameras, lifting World Cup trophies or scoring some of the greatest goals ever scored, Maradona has never been far away from making headlines at World Cups. And even years after his playing retirement, he’s still at it. Having already caused some iremirth with smoking a huge cigar inside a smoke-free stadium in Russia, he’s now had to explain himself after making a gesture that witnesses perceived as racist. What of Panama’s opponents in Sochi? Kevin De Bruyne, Romelu Lukaku, Thibaut Courtois, Dries Mertens, er, Marouanne Fellaini – this is a squad of the highest inidual quality. But it is Eden Hazard who will be striking fear into Panamanian hearts right now (and Phil Jones). The Chelsea forward is bang in form. But we didn’t need Courtois to tell us that.Office sweepstakes. For one lucky person, the source of great riches. For 31 other employees, a complete waste of a fiver. I got Panama, so I fit very comfortably into the latter category. Even so, it would be churlish not to follow the progress of Hernán Darío “Bolillo” Gómez’s side. They’re a “great story” and this, by Sid Lowe, helps explain their journey to Russia.I suppose now would be a pretty good time to plug this, a review of the documentary Managing England: The Impossible Job, which looks at the history of the one of the toughest jobs in sport. Over to the inimitable Sam Wollaston:God, can it really be 22 years ago, Euro 96? That was the last game for the then England manager Terry Venables, although he was always going to go after the competition (time-consuming legal battles, you may remember). The player who missed his spot kick? The current England manager, who has his first game in charge at a major tournament tomorrow. “Those experiences helped me in this role,” he – Gareth Southgate, one of five England bosses to take part in this timely, thorough and thoroughly enjoyable doc – says. Hope so, Gareth.Barnsy writes in below the line. “I read the ‘Who’s going to win the WC’ article in  about a week ago which highlighted 6 teams. Of the 6 mentioned: Germany have lost their opener, Spain, Argentina, Brazil drew theirs, France won and Belgium still to play. Interesting start.” Experts know nothing. Max Rushden is joined by Jacob Steinberg and Paolo Bandini in the studio to review day four’s action, as two of the tournament’s favourites faltered at the first hurdle in the latest World Cup Football Daily. I haven’t had time to listen yet, I dearly hope the pod get around to discussing Neymar and Pot Noodles.Still in any doubt over how much that win means to Mexican people? This is a great bit of audio of a commentator losing it. At least those Mexican fans could watch some action on the telly. That hasn’t been the case so far in Australia, where co-rights holder Optus Sport have come under a barrage of fire from disgruntled fans who haven’t been able watch complete games due to technical problems that have seen the live streaming service regularly interrupted. Amid the national outcry, PM Malcolm Turnbull has got involved. “I have spoken with the Optus CEO, Allen Lew,” Turnbull tweeted. “He assures me he is giving the World Cup streaming problems his personal attention and he believes it will be fixed this evening.” Huzzah! There was a similar statement from Optus on Saturday, a few hours before the problem reared is head again.One of the undoubted highlights from day four was the reaction of the Mexican fans to their goal. There was something about the way Hirving Lozano’s cut back inside before pulling the trigger that, by momentarily delaying the action, intensified the expectation and made the release of emotion when the ball hit the back of the net even more intense. From footage on social media, it was as though the stadium was rocking. There were similar scenes back home too, by all accounts. Upsets! No one is safe! As we try to digest Germany’s “negligent”, “haphazard” opening performance and Brazil’s controversial draw, both off the back of Argentina’s dropped points earlier in the week, thoughts naturally shift to the intriguing question: who’s next in line? And so, with impeccable timing, England open their World Cup campaign later today. Can Tunisia join Mexico, Switzerland and Iceland in getting one over more illustrious opponents?Yet, surely to suggest such an upset is even possible is to assume England are up there with the likes of Germany, Brazil and Argentina. And rankings, tournament history, national psyche and common sense tell us they are not, although try telling that to cheeky Tunisia coach Nabil Maâloul, who has asserted that Gareth Southgate’s men can go all the way in Russia. Clearly a born entertainer, that man – much like the majority of Belgium’s squad, who also debut today, against Panama in Sochi, and also with the threat of an upset of their own hanging over them. Hazard, Lukaku and an exciting glut of Belgian talent have been much vaunted for years now but, as England (and Belgium, for that matter) know only too well, converting expectation into actual, real success can sometimes (often) prove difficult (impossible).A Zlatan-less Sweden complete the day’s agenda (actually they kick it off) against South Korea. More on that one to come as I attempt build the excitement for the next three hours. Simon Burnton will then take over and guide us through until the first kick-off the day, at which time we’ll have separate liveblogs as follows:Feel free to get in touch on email (mike.hytner@the) or Twitter (@mike_hytner) or below the line.

Hours I spent, whole ironed-out hours – time would go very slowly and then very fast and suddenly it was 5pm – in the changing rooms of a selection of high-street shops, trying on swimming costumes. I was going to Center Parcs on the Monday you see (by the time this is published I will have enjoyed a week with three generations of my partner’s family under its magical dome), and had been wearing the same bikini since I was 18. I needed something that would not slide off on a slide.So I started by strolling among the racks with my usual meditative glee at being among so many possibilities of transformation, many of them neon, and entered the changing rooms feeling good, feeling fine, feeling like a person, with a body, who might take it swimming on Monday. That feeling lasted until I stepped into the first swimsuit and yes, saw hell. A waterproof apocalypse.If I might take a moment to talk about my body? It’s a sort of meaty trunk of flesh, with everything, I thought, largely where it should be, ie 1 x belly, 2 x nipples, 2 x legs, 2 x arms, etc, the former in the middle, the latter closer to the edge. If there were a size 11, it would be that, neither obese nor emaciated, sturdy, effective, and yet, it turns out, entirely the wrong shape for a swimming costume. To begin with, the gussets. Usually there’s a selection of bottoms, from shorts to thongs, but this year, the fashion is for a very narrow chocolate eclair sort of shape that extends between the legs and up towards the belly button, requiring even the blondest of women to depilate almost an acre of flesh. So that’s the gussets.But I was prepared for that, and indeed had taken it into consideration when selecting swimsuits, leaving behind a number of costumes that, rather than offer a covering for one’s genitals, instead provided a sort of will-this-do mental floss, like a hastily erected crucifix to show where one has buried the cat. But even the kinder gussets provided only a suggestion of arse coverage, the designer perhaps having never seen a human bottom, instead having only studied medical charts about digestion.I’ve always enjoyed a bikini. No longer. Today’s bikinis are created only for people such as Love Island contestants, for whom the ability to wear a bikini with confidence is the basis of their career. Purchasing one is as ridiculous as, say, a chef buying a chisel – it is the wrong tool for the job. Haters are going to say, “Didn’t she have a baby? Isn’t she in her mid to late-30s with a largely sedentary lifestyle? Isn’t that why she can’t find a flattering bikini?” To them I’d say, yes yes, but surely even the most Hobnobbed of us should be encouraged to swim? Should expect that, at the very least, a bikini should contain the rudest parts of our body, rather than, as these ones did, offer the merest suggestion of coverage, and that’s standing up. Lying down in one of these fabric panic rooms made of three Doritos threaded together with a kind of lurid vine would cause a whole body to puddle beneath the sun lounger.Bikinis though – bikinis, we’ve all held a women’s magazine in June, we all know that we must protect the world from the sight of women in bikinis after the age of 28, what was I thinking? Twist! After a day’s research I can confirm that this season’s all-in-one swimsuits are by far the more obscene choice. They are cut narrowly, to expose the erotic “side-boob”, but if you are larger than a B cup, then they offer a whole teapot of tit to your neighbouring bather. Nothing is adjustable nothing is safe. At any point you might look to your left and greet an entire breast or buttock that has escaped and has been enjoying your conversation with the waiter for some time, just so so pleased with itself.There is a trend, this year, for “cut-outs”. These are shapes hacked out of swimsuits in unlikely places to add interest and mystery – is it a swimming costume, is it a bikini? Who knows! The result, apart from inevitable tanning complications, is a costume with built-in landmines – step carefully, women of 2018, for these cut-outs are liable to take a whole breast off. While also creating little pouches of excitable flesh that will burst through the nylon like summer hernias, hello! Hello, I love you!I travelled home gingerly, in this body that had been exposed to me as trouble, resigned to a holiday sat by the side, cheering the children on. Waving with a hand now revealed to me as a swollen meat puppet, balanced on the end of something wobbly, attached to a machine so complicated and mottled that it should not be driven in public, and certainly not in water. Thanks to this season’s swimwear, Center Parcs slides will be safe from the groaning problem of my body, for this year at least.After I wrote about migraines, hundreds wrote in suggesting cures, including coffee, magnesium, therapy and fasting.

I have never won the lottery, or even found a fiver in an old coat pocket. But there is one aspect in life where fortune has smiled on me: I am eight months pregnant with my first child – the result of IVF treatment.The outcome amazes me still: the first implantation attempt was successful. But, now that the dust has settled, my experience in the private sector has left me feeling discombobulated and angry. According to a recent report by healthcare researcher LaingBuisson, the UK fertility market was worth £320m in 2016, with private investors increasingly interested in the sector. When I heard this, it struck a nerve. Surely infertile patients are the losers when healthcare is run to make profits for investors?IVF is expensive. And what makes it worse, says Hugh Risebrow, the report’s author, is the lack of pricing transparency. “The headline prices quoted may be, say, £3,500, but you end up with a bill of £7,000,” he says. “This is because there are things not included that you need – and then things that are offered, but are not evidence-based.”Those “things” are the add-ons – tests, drugs, equipment, procedures – offered on top of a cycle of IVF and charged for separately. And private fertility clinics sell patients add-ons that have no evidence behind them – in other words, they don’t work.I still ended up with a bill well over £3,000. The price listed for frozen embryo transfer was £1,500. One cycle was cancelled before the implantation stage – costing me £775. Some extra charges were, as Risebrow notes, unavoidable, if not transparent, such as drugs – but some were avoidable. A thyroid function test was recommended – presented as necessary before treatment could begin – but I have since discovered the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) recommends this should be offered only to women with symptoms of thyroid disease.This is not unusual. Information about the efficacy of add-ons and extras is not presented in a clear and coherent manner by all clinics. Often, the treatments or technologies are new and evidence is not yet clear, or available. I am kicking myself that I didn’t question things more at the time – I have a master’s in science journalism. But once through the doors of the clinic, I just wanted to get pregnant.Still, I got off lightly. Author and fertility campaigner Jessica Hepburn had 11 cycles of IVF – all unsuccessful – spending more than £70,000 over eight years. Hepburn says she “had everything going”, including controversial lymphocyte immunisation therapy, which involved being injected with her partner’s and a stranger’s white blood cells. “Patients do want add-ons – they will try anything because they are so desperate,” she says.In 2016, add-ons were investigated by the BBC’s Panorama programme, based on research from the University of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. They found that 26 out of 27 add-ons were not supported by high-quality evidence. But has anything changed since then? Prof Carl Heneghan, the centre’s director, cites the HFEA’s traffic light scheme – something I heard about numerous times while researching this piece, but which not one person mentioned during the many months I spent having treatment. Launched in July 2017, the HFEA website lists the 10 most commonly offered supplementary treatments. They are graded as either green (more than one good quality study that shows the procedure is effective and safe) amber (a growing body of evidence shows promising results, but further research is still required) and red (no evidence to show it is effective and safe). None are green, six are amber and four are red.Heneghan says it’s a step forward, but he wants to see more randomised controlled trials. “This is not a difficult area to reduce uncertainty … you want to know live birthrates, and you can do that systematically. But because this is the private sector there’s no incentive to reduce uncertainty.”Heneghan has no truck with the argument that trials are difficult to do. This, he says, has “always been the answer.” “It’s almost like you’re dragging people into an evidence-based world. It’s 2018.”Dr Jane Stewart is chair of the British Fertility Society, a body endeavouring to ensure patients are well educated. She is also an NHS consultant in reproductive medicine and gynaecology, heading up the Newcastle Fertility Centre. When I say the words “fertility market” to her, she sighs. What has happened, she says, is the “regrettable” practice of couples choosing treatments “like from a shop”.“Straightforward IVF is a good treatment, it doesn’t need a whole lot of extra help,” she says. The answer, for those struggling with infertility, is simple: “People should have a consultation and have treatment that is good for them. It’s about taking the pressure off patients who feel that they need to buy everything.”I am slightly baffled, as I am looking at a price list from her private clinic, where add-ons include assisted hatching (red on the HFEA’s list), embryo glue, (amber) and endometrial receptivity array (ERA) for £1,200.I point this out. “We positively discourage assisted hatching,” says Nargund. Embryo glue? “It’s a fantastic name, but it’s a joke.” ERA? “We have used it in the past, but now we have completely stopped.” So why list them, if she does not agree with their use? “Good question,” she says. For Nargund, it comes down to patient demand. If patients don’t see add-ons, they will go elsewhere, she says, and above all, she wants to educate patients.I don’t doubt that Nargund is sincere. But it’s confusing. After all, if you see something for sale, don’t you assume that you could, and maybe should, buy it?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b152f2a6a7932d1130ded245d2a05be12268c95/0_2419_4888_2933/master/4888.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe925378a31870233114c56f204e3bee","title":"nigel slater simple summer recipes scallops pork chop cherry drizzle cake","story":"Pork chop, herby salads and sides – dishes for relaxed lunches and languid suppersThis is the time of year I like to put several dishes on the table at the same time, a mix of recipes substantial enough to be main courses and others that can be used as an accompaniment or principal dish, as the mood takes you. This approach – thoughtful but relaxed – suits the more informal attitude I have to eating in summer, when courses become interchangeable and dishes tend to be served at cool room temperature, rather than direct from the oven or grill.I say scallops because that is what caught my eye at the fishmongers, but raw, grey prawns work here, too, peeled and sliced in half.

Slice each scallop into three horizontally, then place both white and corals in a single layer in a shallow dish. Mix together the lime juice, zest and olive oil, add a grind or two of black pepper, then pour over the scallops, cover and refrigerate for at least 25 minutes.For the tomato salad, lightly peel the cucumber, slice in half lengthways, then scrape out the seeds with a teaspoon and discard. Cut the cucumber into thin strips, about ½cm wide, then into small dice. Transfer half to a mixing bowl. Reserve the remaining cucumber. Dice the 250g of assorted tomatoes and add them to the bowl, then trim and finely chop the spring onions, folding them into the tomato and cucumber.Put the kettle on to boil. Place the two large tomatoes in a heatproof basin, pour over the freshly boiled water, and leave them for 2 or 3 minutes. Remove from the water and peel off the skins. Halve the peeled tomatoes, discard the seeds then put the flesh in a blender with the sherry vinegar, peeled garlic, olive oil, basil leaves and their stems, a little salt and the reserved chopped cucumber. Process to a thick puree then fold into the chopped cucumber and tomato, cover and chill thoroughly.To serve, spoon the tomato salad and its dressing onto a shallow bowl or serving plate.

Cover with foil and slide into the oven. Leave to bake for 20 minutes, then remove and leave the fish, covered and still in the stock, to cool.Boil the new potatoes in deep, salted water, for about 20 minutes till tender.While the potatoes are cooking make the mayonnaise. Put the egg yolks into a mixing bowl, add the mustard and a good squeeze of lemon juice, and very slowly whisk in the groundnut and olive oils until you have a thick mayonnaise that will stand in soft peaks.Finely chop the mint, parsley and dill and fold into the mayonnaise, seasoning with a little salt as you wish.When the potatoes are tender to the point of a knife, drain them, slice them into thick coins and toss them gently with the mayonnaise.Remove the trout from the cooking liquor and pat dry, then break it into large pieces. Serve with the salad leaves and potato mayonnaise.A salad of multiple textures, with soft young leaves, crunchy, lightly cooked peas and the pleasing knubbly quality of quinoa. Once made, it is a useful base for leftover roast chicken or cold pork torn into juicy pieces, or simply to put on the table with other dishes. I should add that it makes a sound addition to a lunch box, and will be fine in the fridge for a couple of days.Serves 6quinoa 100gpeas 400g (weight with pods)sprouted mung, sunflower and radish seeds 100gcress a small punnetmicro leaves and petals 1 large handfulFor the dressingpomegranate molasses 2 tbsplemon juice 2 tbspolive oil 2 tbspPut the quinoa into a pan with 175ml of water and bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 6 minutes before turning off the heat and leaving, covered, for 20 minutes.Pod the peas and cook them in deep, lightly salted boiling water for 4 minutes or until they are almost tender. (They are good when slightly undercooked.) Drain and plunge them into iced water.To make the dressing, mix together in a large mixing bowl the pomegranate molasses, lemon juice and olive oil, and season lightly. Wash the sprouted seeds in a sieve under running cold water and shake dry. Run a fork through the quinoa to separate the grains, then tip them into the dressing.Mix the sprouted seeds, cress, and micro leaves and petals with the quinoa and its dressing, and serve.The need for something tart, a slightly acidic accompaniment for the sweet and fatty pork, is usually filled by a pool of apple sauce. During their short season, I will use gooseberries in place of Bramley apples, sometimes as a straightforward puree, the fruit cooked with a little water and a dash of sugar then crushed with a fork, and at other times stirred into a heap of fluffy mashed potato.For the gooseberry and parsley mashpotatoes 350ggooseberries 250gsugar 2 tspparsley a good handful, choppedPeel the potatoes, cut them into large, equal-size pieces and bring them to the boil in generously salted water. Lower the heat a little and let them simmer for 20 minutes or until tender.Top and tail the gooseberries, discarding the little brown flowers. Put the fruit in a stainless steel pan, add 2 tablespoons of water and the sugar and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, and let them cook for 3 or 4 minutes, until they have started to collapse.When the potatoes are tender, drain them and mash them with the gooseberries. Taste as you go, adding the chopped parsley and a little more sugar if you wish, but remembering that the mash needs to be tart. Cover and keep warm.Get a grill or griddle hot. Rub the pork chops with a little oil, season with salt, black pepper and the fennel seeds. Cook the chops on the grill or griddle, turning them as necessary, letting the fat crisp. Serve with the gooseberry mash.When the cake comes from the oven, I like to scatter a thick layer of sugar over the top (you’ll need about 3 tablespoons), pierce 20 or more holes in the cake with a metal skewer, then spoon over the hot cherry syrup.I suggest fine-grade polenta for this simple cake.For the syrupcherries 400ghoney 3 tbspelderflower cordial 160mlSet the oven at 180Cgas mark 4.

Grate the zest from the lemon and stir into the polenta. Squeeze the juice from the lemon into a small bowl. Break the eggs into another bowl and beat them lightly.Add the beaten egg to the butter and sugar mixture, beating continuously, adding a little of the polenta should the mixture start to curdle. Then fold in the polenta and the lemon juice.Spoon the batter into the lined cake tin. Bake for 35 minutes, then lower the heat to 160Cgas mark 2 and bake for further 35-40 minutes until the cake is lightly firm to the touch.While the cake bakes, make the syrup. Halve and stone the cherries. Warm the honey and elderflower cordial in a small saucepan, then add the cherries and let them simmer for 5-7 minutes until the fruit has given up some of its juice to the syrup.When the cake is ready, remove from the oven, then pierce all over with a skewer or knitting needle. Spoon some of the syrup from the cherries over the surface of the cake so it runs down through the holes into the crumb of the cake, then leave to cool.Remove the cake from its tin, then serve with the cherry compote and, if you like, some cream or creme fraiche and more fresh cherries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15ccc6f8e296219db6b3c708f08802260820d69e/718_606_4693_2815/master/4693.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce272b05301bf321e4df3a12237bd115","title":"seven ways to improve your memory","story":"Getting plenty of sleep, learning difficult new skills and staying socially active can all help to keep your memory sharpSleeping well helps reinforce episodic memories – those associated with time and place. There is also substantial evidence that REM sleep plays a vital role in the consolidation of memories relating to learning motor skills, such as learning to play a musical instrument or ride a bike. Having a full night’s sleep soon after gaining a new skill helps consolidate the processes involved so they can later be performed “on autopilot”.Stress affects memory in different ways depending on when the stressful event occurs. The rapid release of adrenaline as part of our “fight or flight” response can make us more attentive, but the slower release of cortisol disrupts memory-forming processes. A stressful event that occurs well before efforts to form memories can impair recall, whereas one shortly before or after the learning of new information can enhance it. And getting stressed out just before efforts to retrieve memories impairs our ability to do so. Yoga, meditation or other relaxation techniques may help.Older people are often told to adopt a “use it or lose it” approach to maintaining cognitive function. In fact, when it comes to memory, research suggests that only certain types of mental activities help. In a 2013 study, US researchers found participants aged 60-90 who spent 15 hours a week for three months learning a complex skill, such as digital photography, saw significant improvements in episodic memory tests. This was not the case for those who did more familiar, less demanding, tasks such as crosswords.Positive thinking appears to boost memory performance – researchers at Harvard University found they could improve the performance of people aged 60 and above in memory tests by subliminally presenting them with positive age-related words such as “wise”, “sage” and “astute”. Priming others with words such as “Alzheimer’s”, “forgets” and “confused” undermined their performance. Brain scans have shown differences in activity levels in brain regions during memory encoding, according to whether or not iniduals believe they have good recall abilities or not.Memories can be undermined if the brain doesn’t have enough downtime to consolidate them. More than a century ago, German scientists showed that people performed almost twice as well in memory tests if they took breaks. More recently, neuroscientists have shown that some amnesia patients and healthy volunteers are more able to retain lists of words if the task is followed by periods of quiet time.Having an active social life delays memory loss as we age. US scientists who asked people in their 50s and 60s to do memory tests every other year between 1998 and 2004 found the decline in recall abilities of their most sociable subjects to be half that of the least well connected. Having good friends, volunteering for charities and other forms of social engagement also protect memory.Health claims made for many “superfoods” need to be taken with a pinch of salt. What we eat does, however, affects cognitive function. A 2016 research review found Mediterranean-style diets to be linked to slower rates of cognitive decline, Alzheimer’s disease and improved long-term working memory. So stock up on plant-based foods, cut back on red meat and dairy – and use olive oil as your main source of fat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0aa3e7cd22cc6bf38adfb83f409ac5452931cb/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38bbc2134c3c10da9a06ad31c1651302","title":"westminster council accused of playing politics over bike route","story":"London mayor’s office calls last-minute legal bid to halt CS11 cycleway ‘disgraceful’Westminster council has been accused of political game-playing after it emerged that the Conservative-run local authority had made a last-minute legal bid to block a new cycle route despite it being supported in a public consultation.The council’s decision to seek a judicial review to halt construction of the long-planned scheme risks further poisoning its relations with Sadiq Khan, a week after Westminster also sunk the London mayor’s flagship plan to pedestrianise Oxford Street.Khan made no immediate comment, but a source from his office said the cycle route had significant public support and “shouldn’t be held up by petty political posturing”.The argument centres around what is officially known as cycle superhighway 11 (CS11), the latest in a series of routes designed to separate cyclists from motor traffic. Earlier schemes have proved wildly popular with riders.Construction was due to begin next month on the first section of the route, which would make cycling significantly safer on the huge Swiss Cottage gyratory system, where cyclists currently have to contend with up to five lanes of one-way traffic. It could now be delayed again by Westminster’s move.Transport for London, which leads the scheme, was told last week that a campaign group was seeking a judicial review against it. Led by Jessica Learmond-Criqui, a lawyer and longtime opponent who has used campaign tactics such as putting young children in pollution masks to claim CS11 would increase smog levels, the application cites grounds including misleading cost-benefit assessments and failure to consider the impact of displaced traffic.Westminster has since issued its own claim, believed to be on similar grounds, although details are yet to be filed.The mayor’s office source said: “The fact that Westminster councillors are now trying to stop a new cycle route being built just weeks after pulling the plug on Oxford Street improvements is disgraceful.“There is an urgent need for safer cycle routes into central London and there is an equally strong case for pedestrianising Oxford Street. The idea that Westminster council think they can hold the rest of London to ransom is totally unacceptable.”The council’s move was condemned in a joint statement by the London Cycling Campign and Living Streets, which campaigned over Oxford Street.They said: “By its actions, Westminster council is putting people needlessly at risk of harm for purely political reasons. We urge it to put people’s safety first and stop attempting to wreck efforts to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured on London’s roads.”A Westminster spokeswoman said the council fully supported the provision of safe cycling, but that “residents are overwhelmingly opposed to the cycle superhighway 11 proposals. In particular, they have raised concerns about the impact of traffic displacement on congestion and air quality in the streets adjacent to the proposed route.“We have been in discussions over the last two years with TfL about residents’ concerns but, despite assurances, we have yet to receive any further information about the wider impacts of the scheme and how these may be mitigated. “As TfL is starting to proceed with the Swiss Cottage section without our support for the scheme as a whole, we have been left with no choice but to back our residents and to legally challenge the scheme.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61cafd89c0390c040f77ed1da1614bebbb3862bb/408_140_2589_1553/master/2589.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b8cd8bbdf5ca364c21b9942d41c85d1","title":"david dimbleby to step down as chair of bbcs question time","story":"Presenter, who has hosted the show for 25 years, says he plans to return to reportingDavid Dimbleby is to step down as chairman of the BBC’s Question Time programme after 25 years in the job.“At the end of the year I will have been chairing Question Time for a quarter of a century and I have decided that this is the right moment to leave,” the presenter said.Dimbleby turns 80 later this year, but insists he has no plans to retire from journalism: “Instead, after years in the studio, I now plan to return to my first love: reporting.”The BBC director general, Tony Hall, said the broadcaster and the British public were “extraordinarily lucky to have him in what are – to say the least – interesting times politically and socially … We look forward to working with him on other projects in the future.”Question Time has often hit the headlines while Dimbleby has been at the helm, most notably when it gave a platform to the BNP’s Nick Griffin while enormous protests took place outside the studio. His tenure comes to an end with a final broadcast on 13 December 2018.His decision to leave the high-profile Thursday night discussion show will open up a fierce competition among candidates who hope to replace him. Leading internal candidates include the Newsnight presenters Emily Maitlis and Kirsty Wark, the Today programme hosts Nick Robinson and Mishal Husain, and Desert Island Discs’ Kirsty Young.The BBC could choose to go for a more leftfield choice such as Victoria Derbyshire, whose morning news show has won a series of awards, or the 5Live presenter Emma Barnett, who received plaudits after standing in for Andrew Marr on his Sunday programme earlier this year.Dimbleby is one of only three presenters to have hosted Question Time since it was first broadcast in 1979. The others were Robin Day and Peter Sissons. There is likely to be pressure for the programme’s new chair to be a woman.The current host has gained a cult following during his time on the programme, attracting parody Twitter accounts and even dancing competitions. “I do know there’s a Dimblebot and there’s a Dimbledance and I can do it too,” he said on the show in 2011. Dimbleby has only ever missed one episode of the show, when he was admitted to hospital after being kicked by a cow at his rural Sussex home in 2009.The presenter has also anchored the BBC’s election night coverage since 1979. Four years ago the broadcaster announced that he would be replaced in this role by the News at Ten host Huw Edwards but Dimbleby has managed to cling on, leading television coverage of the EU referendum and last year’s general election. Dimbleby is from a broadcasting family. His father was the pioneering BBC journalist Richard Dimbleby, who provided commentary on the Queen’s coronation and hosted Panorama. His brother is Jonathan Dimbleby, who has hosted Question Time’s sister programme Any Questions? on BBC Radio 4 since 1987."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e858549e79e08a1663a88688b4268b5b556678aa/0_0_4900_2940/master/4900.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=304eca6963d582c2bd5224c1ccc2be19","title":"mortgage value property discount family funds","story":"I’m buying a house at a discount from a family member but need funds to renovate itQ My partner and I are first-time buyers.

How worried should we be? Water seems the most renewable of all the Earth’s resources. It falls from the sky as rain, it surrounds us in the oceans that cover nearly three-quarters of the planet’s surface, and in the polar ice caps and mountain glaciers. It is the source of life on Earth and quite possibly beyond – the discovery of traces of water on Mars aroused excitement because it was the first indication that life may have existed there.The problem is that most of the Earth’s water resources are as inaccessible as if they were on Mars, and those that are accessible are unevenly distributed across the planet. Water is hard to transport over long distances, and our needs are growing, both for food and industry. Everything we do requires water, for drinking, washing, growing food, and for industry, construction and manufacturing. With more than 7.5 billion people on the planet, and the population projected to top 10 billion by 2050, the situation is set to grow more urgent.Currently, 844 million people – about one in nine of the planet’s population – lack access to clean, affordable water within half an hour of their homes, and every year nearly 300,000 children under five die of diarrhoea, linked to dirty water and poor sanitation. Providing water to those who need it is not only vital to human safety and security, but has huge social and economic benefits too. Children lose out on education and adults on work when they are sick from easily preventable diseases. Girls in developing countries are worst off, as they frequently stop going to school at puberty because of a lack of sanitation, and girls and women travelling miles to fetch water or forced to defecate in the open are vulnerable to violence. Providing affordable water saves lives and reduces the burden on healthcare, as well as freeing up economic resources. Every £1 invested in clean water yields at least £4 in economic returns, according to the charity WaterAid.Climate change is bringing droughts and heatwaves across the globe, as well as floods and sea level rises. Pollution is growing, both of freshwater supplies and underground aquifers. The depletion of those aquifers can also make the remaining water more saline. Fertilisers leaching nitrates into the supplies can also make water unsuitable for drinking or irrigation.Cape Town in South Africa provided a stark example of what can happen when water supplies come under threat. For years the city was using more water than it could sustainably supply, and attempts to curb wastage and distribute water supplies more equitably to rich and poor had fallen short of what was needed. By late last year, a crisis point had been reached. The city’s government warned of an imminent day zero, when the water supply would simply run out. Taps would run dry. There would be no more water.In the event, day zero was narrowly averted, in part by public exhortations to use water more efficiently, rationing, changes in practices such as irrigating by night and reusing “grey” water from washing machines or showers, and eventually a new desalination plant.The poor are worst hit. Jonathan Farr, senior policy analyst at WaterAid, says: “Competing demands for water means that those who are poorer or marginalised find it more difficult to get water than the rich and powerful.” Many governments and privatised water companies concentrate their provision on wealthy districts, and prioritise agriculture and industry over poorer people, while turning a blind eye to polluters and those who over-extract water from underground sources. Sharing access to water equitably requires good governance, tight regulation, investment and enforcement, all qualities in short supply in some of the world’s poorest and most water-scarce areas.The number of water-scarce areas is increasing: Cape Town is just the beginning. A ground-breaking new study based on data from the Nasa Grace – Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment – satellites over a 14-year period discovered 19 hotspots around the world where water resources are being rapidly depleted, with potentially disastrous results. They include areas of California, north-western China, northern and eastern India, and the Middle East. Overall, as climate change scientists had predicted, areas of the world already prone to drought were found to be getting drier, and areas that were already wet getting wetter. The authors were uncompromising: the results showed that “water is the key environmental issue of the century,” they said. For instance, he notes, in many remote parts of sub-Saharan Africa, “there may be sufficient supplies of groundwater but there has not been enough investment in service delivery and service management to ensure that people can access this water”.Some of the most effective ways of managing water resources are also the simplest. Plugging leaks in pipes is a good example – ageing or poorly maintained infrastructure wastes vast quantities of water. A dripping tap can leak 300 litres a year. In the UK, the Environment Agency has warned of water shortages across the south-east of the country within a few years, if the 3bn litres a day wasted through leaks – enough for the needs of 20 million people – continues.Water meters for domestic users in developed countries have been controversial, because they can penalise large families which have greater needs. But they provide a readily recognisable gauge to give households more information on their usage, and encourage them not to waste water, particularly as there are readily available technical fixes, from short flush toilets to spray taps and shower heads. Irrigation has enabled farmers even in arid regions to grow a wider variety of crops. Some methods of irrigation are highly inefficient – in hot countries, water sprayed on crops evaporates before it can reach the roots. An alternative is drip irrigation, a system of pipes that delivers water directly to the roots of each plant, but this is also prone to wastage.Traditional methods can also be usefully restored in many regions, adds Marc Stutter, of the James Hutton Institute. He notes that in Rajasthan, in India, restoring traditional small dams called johads enabled the periodic rains to be held before they dissipated across the land. The johads led to “the miraculous revitalisation to a green landscape and the surface water returning”.Advances in sensor technology offer a new way forward. Field sensors, available for as little as $2 a year, can monitor the moisture content in soil, letting farmers know whether irrigation is needed and allowing them to calibrate the irrigation more finely than has previously been possible.Science is also being brought to bear on the crops themselves. Plant biologists are breeding varieties less prone to drought, through natural selection, and in some cases using genetic modification.But science and technology can only go so far. As with most water issues, the biggest problem is still governance and equity. Farmers will grow what they can to turn a profit, and many have little alternative than to use scarce groundwater resources. Without strong governance, this can lead to disaster as the depletion has a widespread effect on the whole local community.Climate change will not only mean more droughts, but also more frequent floods. These can be devastating to agriculture and cities, especially coastal cities already under threat from rising sea levels and stronger storm surges.The World Bank estimates that the damage to cities from flooding will top $1tn by 2050 if strong action is not taken to equip cities to cope with the consequences.Making the world more resilient to flooding involves more than just building walls and barriers such as London’s Thames Barrier, though these are still used. Increasingly, planners are finding ways to “make space for water”, and return to natural protections.For instance, in tropical areas more than a fifth of the mangrove swamps that used to cling to the coastline have been destroyed, cut down to make way for agriculture and aquaculture. Restoring mangroves yields many benefits: they protect inland areas from sea level rises and storm flooding, and provide nurseries for fish, increasing fishing yields. Mangrove restoration projects are now operating in countries from Bangladesh and Indonesia, to Cote d’Ivoire and Suriname.Flood plains and water meadows also provide natural water storage, with land that acts like a sponge to soak up water, releasing it gradually over time. This can prove unpopular with farmers who want to grow crops on such land, but payments from the public purse can offset the cost to them. In the UK, for instance, projects are under way from Historic England and the National Trust.Floating houses are another idea that is taking off, from the Netherlands to south-east Asia. The houses are built on floating platforms instead of foundations, but anchored to the sea or river bed, and a wide variety of modern designs are now available. Projects are already under way as far afield as Lagos and London’s Docklands.Sustainable development goal six from the UN concerns water, stating that safe water and sanitation should be provided to all by 2030. But WaterAid’s Farr notes that at current rates, some countries will miss the deadline by centuries. World governments will meet at the UN this summer to discuss the progress.According to James Famiglietti, co-author of the Nasa Grace study, some of the areas most vulnerable are “already past sustainability tipping points” as their major aquifers are being rapidly depleted, in particular the Arabian peninsula, the north China plain, the Ogallala aquifer under the great plains of the US, the Guarani aquifer in south America, the north-west Sahara aquifer system and others. “When those aquifers can no longer supply water – and some, like the southern half of the Ogallala, may run out by 2050 – where will we be producing our food and where will the water come from?” he asks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a09873756f76e79c4671a3837197cbf02f6ca14/0_0_4484_3035/master/4484.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d87ff51f2a1d472b191b43c2f916ebe","title":"can you solve it mirror mirror on the wall","story":"A puzzle to reflect onHere’s a puzzle about something we do every day: gaze at ourselves in the mirror. Who says maths is not relevant to the real world? In fact, You may have often pondered this question without realising it when trying on clothes.A man is facing a mirror hanging on a wall 1m in front of him. (The puzzle requires some basic physics, which I will spell out here. First, light travels in a straight line. Secondly, when light reflects in a mirror the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. In other words, light hitting a mirror behaves just like a snooker ball bouncing against the side cushion: the angle it hits the cushion is the same as the angle of the rebound.)I’ll be back at 5pm with the solution.

Paul Williams, a forensic scientist who led the development of one of the most widely used breath alcohol tests, said some experts have “shopping lists” of spurious technical data they request, including engineer and service logs for breathalysers, calibration certificates and the readouts from hundreds of previous tests.The relevance of such material, which was obtained by Cipriani’s defence team and unsuccessfully used to challenge the reliability of the breathalyser result, was questioned by the the high court judge in the rugby player’s 2016 trial. In other trials, experts have suggested the readouts could be corrupted by the presence of mobile phones, dust in the air or dental mouthwash.In another recent drink-driving case, Joanne Cronshaw, a senior prosecutor in Greater Manchester, told the court the Crown Prosecution Service was concerned about “a pattern of disclosure requests of this sort now being made routinely in excess alcohol cases”, with “serious practical implications for the resources of the CPS and police”.Williams said the practice had increased in the past couple of years at the behest of a few specialised law firms. “If you’re going to go down that route,” he said, “you might as well throw the machines out the window.”However, Tara Boyle, a partner at Geoffrey Miller Solicitors, which specialises in motor offences, said defence teams are entitled to scrutinise scientific evidence. “For every request for disclosure there’s a reason behind that,” she said. “It’s our duty to investigate.”The issue is the latest problem to emerge around the disclosure of forensic evidence in criminal trials. Since December police and the CPS have faced intense criticism over repeated failures to disclose crucial mobile phone evidence, leading to the collapse of a series of rape cases.A spokesman for the CPS said: “Proper and timely disclosure of evidence is vital to ensuring defendants get a fair trial. We are aware of regular challenges to prosecution evidence made by the defence in drink- or drug-driving cases and we have worked with the National Police Chiefs’ Council to develop guidance for our prosecutors on the appropriate handling of such requests.”Mundy did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15ea760af193db4b1a93c729c4cc6b2fd7a4c060/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a81968152f8430fedc223e2234bbfd20","title":"grenfell style cladding drops flat value nerisa ahmed","story":"Nerisa Ahmed and her husband to sue government agency that helped them buy their homeA family who have seen the value of their London flat slashed from £600,000 to just £90,000 because of Grenfell-style cladding will sue a government agency that helped them buy their home.They are the second homeowners in the New Capital Quay development in Greenwich to have their flat valued at rock-bottom prices. Nerisa Ahmed and her husband bought the flat under the help to buy scheme when it was built three years ago and have had two offers fall through in the past six months because of the cladding.In their report for Ahmed, Taylor Chartered Surveyors said the collapse in value of her flat was because the cost of replacing the cladding was unknown and that it was unclear when the cladding would be replaced due to ongoing legal discussions between developer Galliard and the insurer of the building. The company said some flats had been valued at £0. They were unsellable, unrentable and unmortgageable. “My flat is dangerous. I panic every night as I put my son to bed. I’m on the top floor – the 10th – and having a fire here is not something I’d like to experience,” said Ahmed.“It’s very stressful. I’m not doing this for the money,” said Ahmed.At the end of April she and her husband handed over the remaining £18,000 and expected the paperwork to follow within days of completion, but this did not happen. Ahmed, a lawyer, has said she will sue if it does not deliver on its contractual agreement to redeem her loan.“To change the rules and apply them retrospectively is an abuse of power. It is like buying a house and handing over the money and then the vendor doesn’t hand over the keys,” said Ahmed.Her plight highlights the predicament of thousands of homeowners in more than 100 private blocks around the country that still have Grenfell-style cladding, who are not getting help from the government.“The government have done nothing about forcing private developers to remove the cladding and, instead of attacking the root of the problem, they are adding to the stress. We are people and it is not like we have any choice in this: we can’t move, we can’t rent, we can’t sell. We are trapped in a fire trap. It’s like having your freedom taken away.New Capital Quay is believed to be the largest development in the country with Grenfell-style cladding, with almost 2,000 homes.Galliard Homes, the developer in Greenwich, is facing a bill of between £30m and £40m to replace the cladding and has done nothing to start the remediation works since it was discovered last year. It is now locked in a legal dispute with the National House Building Council (NHBC) over who is to blame and who should pay, in a case that lawyers say could take years to resolve.The couple, who have racked up large debts from postgraduate studies, had hoped to move to a larger flat to accommodate their son, who is two, and their parents.In her letter before action, which initiated her legal dispute, Ahmed told Target HCA that she understood it might be concerned with the fall in value of such properties but said it could not change the rules after it had entered into a contract to redeem her loan.Homes England said the redemption of help to buy loans was “purely an administrative matter and no contract has been reneged on”. It said it had not changed the rules on help to buy after the Grenfell scandal but could not comment on inidual cases.If a home is hit by “novel issues” such as Grenfell-style cladding, “Homes England reserves the right ... to agree the valuer used”. It said in some cases it could get a second opinion on valuation to ensure “the interests of borrowers and taxpayer” were protected. Taregt said: “If a borrower’s property is affected by novel issues in relation to its valuation, eg its external cladding, Homes England reserves the right, in accordance with the terms of the equity mortgage, to agree the valuer used. This ensures the appropriate due diligence is carried out in the interests of borrowers and the taxpayer investment in these homes.”Galliard declined to comment. The NHBC said: “We understand that the situation at New Capital Quay is very concerning for residents. We have been in regular contact with the residents to keep them updated.” It said Galliard’s subsidiary that is managing the estate, PMML, “is legally responsible for the ongoing safety” and its house guarantee “does not absolve PMML of this duty”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4afa9e6e04d007c9b1d34a4772fa69bb8ef68c54/70_263_2837_1703/master/2837.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e94b568022253ee07fd16313384941f9","title":"brooks koepka history tommy fleetwood retain us open","story":"• Floridian becomes third man since the war to win back to back• Fleetwood shoots a record-equalling 63 and loses by a shotThe only problem with Tommy Fleetwood’s making of history was Brooks Koepka’s eagerness to do likewise. On a Long Island Sunday when Fleetwood joined the elite group who have shot 63 in the US Open, the Englishman’s bid for a maiden major title came up agonisingly short. Koepka is just the third man since the second world war and the seventh in history to defend the US Open title successfully.Koepka’s triumph came by one shot, at one over par, from the inspired Fleetwood. Koepka was even afforded the luxury of a bogey at the last before signing for a 68. The Florida native will not be in the ever-growing queue for those looking to criticise the United States Golf Association. It has, after all, bestowed $4m worth of cheques on him over back-to-back Junes.Koepka had not foreseen this scenario even two months ago. He had fallen victim to a long-term wrist injury so serious that the lifting of a coffee cup was problematic. After a doctor remedied the problem, he set his sights on defending the trophy claimed at Erin Hills 12 months earlier. It was, at that stage, a long shot.Koepka’s versatility was demonstrated here. Whereas a year ago he indulged in a scoring blitz to win at 16 under par, Shinnecock Hills required a battle-hardened approach. Koepka had been unflappable when reaching the turn in 33 and notching a birdie at the 10th. Thereafter came the key moments the 28-year-old rattled home a bogey putt at the 11th when a far higher score had looked probable. He also saved par from tricky situations at the 12th and 13th before a wonderful approach to the par-five 16th gave him the two-shot cushion that was to prove crucial.For so long, this looked like being Fleetwood’s major. The Southport man was six shots adrift of the lead after 54 holes, meaning his final round was over by 4pm. What a final round it was, though Fleetwood made eight birdies and one bogey, at the 9th. There was a bittersweet element, too, as he missed birdie chances at the 16th and 18th – the latter from nine feet – when seeking to become the first player to post 62 in the US Open.“I knew I had chances for the record but it is something very special to shoot 63 in the final round of the US Open,” he said. “It feels strange to feel a little disappointed not to have shot 62 but it’s been a great day and to equal the record is very special. There’s not many people who have done it, so it’s very special and one of the best days I’ve ever had on a golf course.“The crowds were amazing. They are always great with me and I am very grateful for the support I get over here. When I went on that run on the back nine I was just loving getting everybody going and roaring for me. It was very cool. That walk down 18 will live with me for a long time.”Indeed, by the time he took to the 72nd green the American galleries were chanting the name of Fleetwood. Such a scenario is almost unheard of for a European player when the leaderboard is laden with stars and stripes.Dustin Johnson, one of four co-leaders at the start of the day, delivered the kind of wasteful putting performance which also undermined his US Open dream at Chambers Bay in 2015. The world No 1 finished third at plus-three on account of a 70.Patrick Reed’s charge had fuelled prospects of victory at the Masters and US Open in the same season. He played his first seven holes in five under par. The brakes were soon applied, however, Reed dropping shots at the 9th, 11th and 12th. His 68 meant fourth place, one ahead of Tony Finau.The USGA, so wounded by fierce criticism of the course set-up on day three, loosened the shackles for the closing day. That, of course, suggests the tournament organisers are unclear as to what precisely they want from the US Open. The dramatic shift in scoring patterns between rounds three and four hardly pointed towards a planning masterclass.Rickie Fowler’s 65 was 19 shots better than he had produced on Saturday. Fleetwood improved 16 strokes from day three. Hideki Matsuyama signed for a 13-shot swing to the good. Phil Mickelson, the man at the centre of epic controversy, turned an 81 into a 69 before beating a hasty retreat to avoid post-round interviews.Justin Rose left himself with too much ground to make up having produced sixes at the 4th and 5th. A 73 and plus-seven total meant a share of 10th. His fellow Englishman, Tyrell Hatton, was a shot better off and tied sixth. Yet this was Koepka’s day, again. What a lucrative habit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bc2ad07df9a67db1f536e261338b84247ce69f2/0_112_3053_1832/master/3053.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee2109c4ae125925426ad6f183d238c5","title":"johanna konta ashleigh barty final","story":"• British No 1 storms off court after Nature Valley Open final• Line call from chair umpire prompts angry outburstJohanna Konta, who blew a 4-1 lead in the deciding set, was furious with the chair umpire over a poor line call and stormed off court to cool down before returning to congratulate Ashleigh Barty for winning the Nature Valley Open in Nottingham on Sunday.“This is an absolute joke.

TV has never just been about what we’re watching, but who we’re watching it withI’ll cut to it, I’ve been watching Love Island. Sorry about that, but it’s for intellectuals too, you know. It’s a special time of the year, like the day ants grow wings. Many of my most cultured acquaintances, people who read Barthelme and have opinions on Shostakovich, have started talking like teenagers in Westfield and wearing white jeans. Curious, emboldened by the reduced stigma, and having Googled “is Caroline Flack a gateway drug to the Kardashians?”, I gave the first episode a watch. Like morphine, it took quick hold.We’re a special breed, people who need to rationalise watching popular programmes. “Crucial to stay in touch with the demotic idiom,” I think to myself, to justify the fact I am going to spend 100 hours this summer watching men with 88 abs ask each other where their head’s at. “It’s actually interesting from a sociological perspective,” I say, to explain why I’m interested in whether a shy A\u0026ampE doctor can hook up with a glamour model from Southend-on-Sea. My excuses ring as hollow as some of the contestants’ heads. The fact is, I just enjoy it.I do think the show teaches us something about human nature but I’m not sure it’s something I want to know. What’s that zombie saying – you never understand the appeal of being undead until you’re bitten? Despite my inner conflict about the show’s heteronormative, body-fascist vapidity, I’ve been seduced by it. Or rather, something around it: the fact I’m watching what everyone else is watching.It’s frequently said we’re living through a golden age of television. (The people who say this always sound so smug, as if they had anything to do with it.) And that’s true. Scripted dramas from the Sopranos to Patrick Melrose have hit new heights of world-building, thematic complexity and acting ability. Content-wise, no one should be watching Love Island, or Real Housewives, or America’s Next Top Arsehole, or Keeping Up with the Kardashians or Fucking Off With the Beckhams or whatever’s on now. But TV has never just been about what we’re watching it’s about who we’re watching it with.Thirty million people watched EastEnders on Christmas Day, 1986. These days, 30 million people don’t do anything together, apart from protest against Donald Trump. When I was young, there were four channels. All my friends watched … well, Friends. Next day, we’d talk about the best bits, from the one with the blackout, to the ones with Bruce Willis, to the one where they discover Ross’s monkey is a military bioweapon, and Dustin Hoffman has to stop him being blown up. Actually, that’s the film Outbreak. This was a long time ago, and that monkey worked a lot.My new hobby has recaptured some of that epic intimacy. It shortcuts friendship, lets me strike up conversations with strangers. Speaking the lingua franca is new to me, yet the natives have been kind. Watching week by week, rather than bingeing, means no one knows more than anyone else, and we can speculate together. People don’t suggest a superior series by the same writers you should be watching instead, or lecture you on why the show is important. They just have a gossip, a crucial part of the social glue. The value of connection is connection itself, as Hayley from Love Island would say.It’s a dangerous slope for me, though – self-styled maverick and outsider, discovering the comfort of conformity, and needing to belong. Thank God there isn’t a major sports tournament on at the same time, enabling me to finally win the approval of men I don’t know in the pub.Hey drinkers, there’s a new spot in town you should think about. I’m not saying you should go I’m saying you should think about it. Moonshine Saloon is an immersive, pop-up cocktail joint on London’s King’s Road, themed like a wild west saloon.I was unfortunate enough to visit the creator’s former venture, Alcotraz, an east London bar with a prison theme. I remember changing into an orange jumpsuit and being led to a cell, where we were smuggled cocktails by other “inmates”, while avoiding actors pretending to be guards. Lol. We were given ID numbers, lined against a wall and “strip searched”. Pure bants.Don’t get me wrong, it’s novel to take a thrill ride inside systemic inequality that doesn’t affect you but it’s not something I can relax into. Sam Shearman, the founder of the company that runs the bars, defended his misery safari, claiming it “gently opens the door to fiction and TV showing Alcatraz”. A door gently opening seems like an ironic metaphor.On the face of it, Moonshine Saloon sounds safer. It is “inspired by the captivating tales of the wild west and its covert operations”. Which operations would those be? President Jackson’s Indian removal policy, with its inhumane forced marches? Or the stealing and selling of land belonging to those native Americans who remained? Probably not. They mean the familiar caricature of rugged gunslingers from TV movies, pardner, duelling outside bars.On my visit to Alcotraz, the other inmates all felt unbothered by the environment. Was I overreacting? It made me pause, to see my friends and I through their eyes, as caricatures ourselves: snowflake liberals who only want to stop other people having a good time. There we sat, in our separate cells, drinking together and apart.Luckily, I can denounce these bars in non-political terms. A night of drinking should feel improvisatory, unscripted, pure potential. Alcotraz and Moonshine Saloon are the opposite. As immersive theatre they’re bobbins, having no drama or a believable world. Entry to Moonshine Saloon costs £34, per person, for less than two hours inside. And you have to provide your own alcohol, in unopened bottles. Now that, we can all agree, is offensive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0ed198ede103f3ced4b5f79bc4b858672ea6d90/0_44_2912_1748/master/2912.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3318d6aba55eaa98ff1cbc2d7dff34db","title":"us immigration family separations beto orourke texas","story":"First Lady calls on ‘both sides’ to come together on immigration reform as Democrats press for changes on controversial policyMelania Trump’s spokeswoman has said the first lady “hates to see children separated from their families”, in a rare public statement at odds with her husband’s policy of separating children from their parents at the Mexico border.Stephanie Grisham said the first lady believed “we need to be a country that follows all laws”, but also one “that governs with heart”. She added: “Mrs Trump ... hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform.”Former first lady Laura Bush has made a similar plea, writing in the Washington Post that a zero-tolerance policy was “cruel” and “immoral”. But unlike Melania Trump, Bush placed responsibility firmly on the Trump administration’s policy, not “both sides”. “The reason for these separations is a zero-tolerance policy for their parents, who are accused of illegally crossing our borders,” she wrote.Melania Trump’s intervention came as reports emerged of children being held in cages at a warehouse in Texas after being separated from their parents. One cage had 20 children inside.Those conditions were reported by media briefly allowed into the facility by US Border Patrol. But Donald Trump’s secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Neilsen, criticised what she called “misreporting” by politicians and the press. Elaborating on her statement that “we do not have a policy of separating families at the border”, she tweeted: “DHS takes very seriously its duty to protect minors in our temporary custody from gangs, traffickers, criminals and abuse. We have continued the policy from previous administrations and will only separate if the child is in danger, there is no custodial relationship between ‘family’ members, or if the adult has broken a law.”Melania Trump was joined in criticising the policy by a range of her husband’s allies, including the Rev Franklin Graham, who called it “disgraceful”, former White House communications director Anthony Scaramuicci, who said it was not “the Christian way” or “the American way”, and Republican senator Lindsey Graham, who said: “President Trump could stop this policy with a phone call.”According to DHS figures, since the announcement of the “zero tolerance” policy by attorney general Jeff Sessions, almost 2,000 children have been separated from their families. There is no law mandating separation of families. But White House policy is to maximize criminal prosecutions of people caught trying to enter the US illegally. That means more adults are jailed, pending trial, so children are removed from them. Before the Trump policy, many without a criminal record were referred for civil deportation, which generally did not break up families.Amidst outcry, Donald Trump has stuck to the untrue claim that Democrats are to blame. On Saturday, the president tweeted: “Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation, for a change! This is why we need more Republicans elected in November ... ”Trump has repeatedly referred to a Democratic law. He appears to be referring to one enacted in 2008 that was signed by a Republican president, George W Bush. It was focused on freeing and helping children who come to the border without a parent or  and did not call for family separation.In April 2018, the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced a “zero tolerance” policy under which anyone who crossed the border without legal status would be prosecuted by the justice department. This includes some, but not all, asylum seekers. Because children can’t be held in adult detention facilities, they are being separated from their parents.Immigrant advocacy groups, however, say hundreds of families have been separated since at least July 2017.\u0026nbspMore than 200 child welfare groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United Nations, said they opposed the practice.\u0026nbspThey are supposed to enter the system for processing “unaccompanied alien children”, which exists primarily to serve children who voluntarily arrive at the border on their own. Unaccompanied alien children are placed in health department custody within 72 hours of being apprehended by border agents. They then wait in shelters for weeks or months at a time as the government searches for parents, relatives or family friends to place them with in the US.This already overstretched system has been thrown into chaos by the new influx of children.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOn the other side, advocates for children have said they do not know how to find parents, who are more likely to have important information about why the family is fleeing its home country. And if, for instance, a parent is deported, there is no clear way for them to ensure their child is deported with them.When an influx of families and unaccompanied children fleeing Central America arrived at the border in 2014, Barack Obama’s administration detained families.This was harshly criticized and a federal court in 2015 stopped the government from holding families for months without explanation. Instead, they were released while they waited for their immigration cases to be heard in court. Not everyone shows up for those court dates, leading the Trump administration to condemn what it calls a “catch and release” program.The president of the American Academy of Pediatrics warned this week that forcibly separating children from their parents is a traumatic experience that will cause “irreparable harm”. On Sunday, senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told NBC’s Meet the Press: “As a mother, as a Catholic, as somebody who has a conscience ... I will tell you that nobody likes this policy.”Conway echoed Trump in saying Democrats must negotiate over immigration reform and border security. But when NBC host Chuck Todd said it “sounds like you’re holding the kids hostage to get the Democrats to the table”, Conway objected “very forcefully” and said: “I certainly don’t want anybody to use these kids as leverage.”That was not what an unnamed White House official told the Washington Post this week, saying: “The thinking in the building is to force people to the table.”The New York Times reported on Saturday that Stephen Miller, a hardliner who wrote the original travel ban on a list of Muslim-majority countries, is the chief driver of the separation policy. As the president headed to his golf club on Sunday, Democrats staged protests at detention facilities. One party rising star, from Texas, said events at the border were the responsibility of all Americans.“I’d like to say it’s un-American but it’s happening right now in America,” Beto O’Rourke, a US representative who in November will challenge Ted Cruz for his Senate seat, told CNN’s State of the Union. “It is on all of us, not just the Trump administration. This is on all of us.”O’Rourke organized a march to Tornillo, Texas, and what has been described as a “tent structure” for 16- and 17-year-olds. Some had crossed the border on their own, O’Rourke told CNN. Others made the journey with their parents and then were forcibly taken away.Those minors were now in Tornillo, he said, “with no idea no idea when or if they will see their mothers or their fathers, on this father’s day, again. This is inhumane. We will we be judged for what we do or what we fail to do now.”The Oregon senator Jeff Merkley led a group to the border near McAllen and Brownsville, Texas. On the other side of the country, seven members of Congress visited an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey.The group was denied entry for “over an hour”, they said, and police officers were called before they were allowed inside. At one point, New Jersey Democrat Bill Pascrell wrote, he and another member of Congress were “literally banging on the door to gain entry to the jail to see separated families”.New York’s Jerry Nadler told press and protesters people inside were “like the majority of migrants traveling from Central America, who are fleeing violence that has been well documented. Parents fleeing such unspeakable violence will do almost anything they can to protect their children from that violence. Instead they are being welcomed by more terror.”Earlier this week O’Rourke’s midterm opponent, Cruz, defended the Trump policy: “When you see reporters, when you see Democrats saying, ‘Don’t separate kids from their parents,’ what they’re really saying is don’t arrest illegal aliens.”On Sunday, Cruz tweeted: “My dad has been my hero my whole life. Here’s to wishing a very happy #FathersDay to all the dads out there!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4dbf938b8ef22490460dda43bc34d9c0afeba58/0_152_4380_2627/master/4380.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=150b26462c2740d2aec27aba3a6e8a04","title":"fathers day gift jay z","story":"For boys trying to learn to be men, the rapper and businessman’s autobiography can provide a guideCan growing up without a father be a gift? That’s how Jay-Z counterintuitively described it, in his autobiography. “We were kids without fathers … and in a way, that was a gift,” the rapper and businessman writes in Decoded. “We got to pick and choose the ancestors who would inspire the world we were going to make for ourselves.”If you choose the right inspirations, growing up without a dad can be a gift. But, as the title of Jay-Z’s album Blueprint 2: The Gift and the Curse suggests, there’s a flip side. Many of us who spend Father’s Day wishing we had somebody to celebrate with haven’t chosen the right influences as substitutes. We might not be making many choices at all.I grew up without a father regularly in my life. I would leave my mom’s house every morning searching for what was missing at home – the role models who could show me how to be a man. Like many kids in the same situation – and many of my peers were fatherless – I found those role models on television and in music.Jay-Z was one of them: the pre-Beyoncé Jay-Z of the late 1990s and early 2000s, big pimpin’ and trading disses with fellow New York rapper Nas. His tough-guy bravado, glorification of crime, flashy jewelry and videos full of dancing women captivated me. I tried my best to emulate him and other rappers. My friends and I wanted to use drugs and thought selling them was cool we got into fights, skipped classes and in some cases dropped out altogether. Studying seemed boring when compared to the gangster fairytales we shared. Delayed gratification, which is vital to living life with long-term benefits in mind, was a foreign concept.I have no interest in blaming Jay-Z – or any other man – for playing a role in my life he didn’t ask for. My father uniquely carried the responsibility of setting an example for me. But he, too, had fallen to the curse of fatherlessness. Born an orphan in Kenya, he was re-orphaned at 14 when his adoptive parents passed away. He persevered, working his way from an apprentice at the Hilton Hotel in Nairobi to a chef at the Hilton Hotel in London by the time he was 21. When the time came for him to have a family of his own, however, the curse caught up with him. He didn’t know how to be a husband to my mom or a dad to me. He had no examples from his past or his present to provide guidance. Unlike the years my father spent training with other chefs to learn how to succeed in the kitchen, he had no role models to show him how to be a family man. It didn’t take long for my father to give up and disappear.Evidently, it’s not easy to fill the void – but even easier to find the wrong influences. Kids today are exposed to a much broader range of media technologies than I was in the 1990s through which to find examples for what a “man” is. Online communities formed through social media and discussion boards can exert their own kind of masculine peer pressure: incel (“involuntarily celibate”) culture, which became the subject of international media coverage after this year’s mass murders in Parkland, Florida and my hometown, Toronto, is an example of how young men can develop resentful, angry and self-victimizing masculine identities while having these identities reinforced by an online peer group.As president, Barack Obama made it a priority to deliberately and strategically steer vulnerable young men away from the negative influences that affect fatherless kids. His initiative My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) galvanized foundations, businesses, local governments and community groups to promote a milestones-based example for young men to follow, including reading at grade level by grade three, attending postsecondary education and staying out of the criminal justice system. MBK offered a way to identify healthy role models at different stages of a young man’s life without being overly exclusive in defining who and what a man can be. MBK was renamed just before Obama left the White House and seems to have gone quiet as a federal government initiative. It continues as a nongovernmental organization.My search for role models wasn’t as deliberate or strategic as Obama advocates for, but after years of trial and error I was able to find positive role models in community college and then university. In particular, professors showed me how learn to read and write effectively, built my self-esteem and encouraged me to find new peer groups. Professors also connected me with role models in books, such as Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X, Booker T Washington, Marcus Garvey and WEB Du Bois, who demonstrated the ersity of ways men can and do exist in the world. With the right support, not having a dad became an opportunity for me to choose positive inspirations.A few weeks into my first semester at Yale law school, Jay-Z published his autobiography. It turned out he had transformed over the same period of time I had. In an interview about his book, he recalled the lyrics to one of his songs that I loved as a kid (Big Pimpin’) and confessed: “I can’t believe I said that. And kept saying it. What kind of animal would say this sort of thing?”Today, Jay-Z’s example as a husband and father, detailed in last year’s album 4:44, helps me when thinking about how to be a good partner to my girlfriend and a good father figure to her son, responsibilities for which I often feel deeply unprepared. Knowing that others are fighting a legacy of fatherlessness in their own lives motivates me to continue believing, trying and learning. For those of us lucky enough to eventually see growing up without a dad as a positive opportunity, the challenge remains for us to help more fatherless kids find life’s gifts and escape its curses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9495d24d73893d5a8e561417cf2d36cddd908c7/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b27aae49f0308433b57024b58313852","title":"barcelona calls for extra state aid to help settle aquarius arrivals","story":"City council says Madrid’s humanitarian gesture should be backed up with resourcesBarcelona city council has said more state aid will be needed to help settle refugees and migrants as the Catalan capital prepares to take in 100 people from the rescue ship Aquarius.Ignasi Calbó, the co-ordinator of the Barcelona City of Refugees programme, said that Pedro Sánchez’s new Socialist government needed to back up its humanitarian gesture with money and policies.“If it’s committed on the issue of refugees, the Sánchez government has no option but to provide resources,” he said. “There could be 300 more Aquarius this year so there needs to be a consistent policy.”The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, also called earlier this week for the central government to fulfil its obligations. “Cities can’t do it all themselves. We need policies and resources that allow us to plan for this,” she said.Since the Barcelona City of Refugees plan was launched in 2015, the city council has spent €6m (£5.2m) attending to 11,600 refugees and illegal immigrants. Colau has asked the new Madrid government to re-establish the €200m refugee reception fund that was abolished in 2011.“The government’s gesture has to be accompanied by resources,” Calbó said. “We’ve had 10 years of the People’s party who have done nothing to deal with refugees and immigration and have done nothing for the cities that are in the frontline when it comes to migration.”It will fall to the city’s Service Centre For Immigrants, Emigrants And Refugees) to accommodate and arrange schooling for the new arrivals. The state has an obligation to provide housing via NGOs for the first 12 months, which can be extended to two years in the most vulnerable cases. If the refugees have learnt the language and found work by the end of that time, they become legal residents like any other immigrant. If they do not, and jobs are scarce, they have to rely on organisations such as Caritas, the Catholic church’s charitable wing. “It’s going to be difficult to find places for these people,” a spokeswoman for Caritas’s immigration programme said. “We have emergency housing for 85 people but all the places are occupied.” Another 80 places offered by the city authorities are also full.  How many of the 100-plus unaccompanied minors on board the Aquarius will arrive in Barcelona remains to be seen, but the city already hosts about 2,000, mainly from Morocco. There is a chronic shortage of resources to help these young people, many of whom end up living precariously on the street, often resorting to crime in order to survive. Much of the burden again falls on the voluntary sector, but Caritas has facilities to house just 10 minors. The new Spanish government has been praised for taking in the 630 people aboard the Aquarius, but the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has said the country face “another very challenging year” as people cross the Mediterranean in search of refuge and a better life.Figures from the International Organisation for Migration show that 8,309 migrants and refugees have reached Spain by sea so far this year, and 240 have died en route. Last year, 21,468 refugees and migrants arrived by crossing the Mediterranean, and 224 people died on the journey. The 2017 figures were a threefold increase on the previous year.María Jesús Vega, a spokeswoman for UNHCR Spain, said the agency applauded the government’s decision to help the migrants and refugees on board the Aquarius.She also said the strong and positive response from regional governments, city councils and civil society groups could pave the way for a necessary review of how Spain deals with migrants and asylum seekers.“This could be an excellent opportunity to reconsider the national strategy on managing arrivals,” she said. “We’re seeing coordination mechanisms that allow regional and autonomous governments to participate in the process of taking in people. That’s the direction we need to go in when it comes to dealing with the challenges of the current situation, of which there are many.”UNHCR has previously called for closer coordination between government departments, police, maritime rescue services and NGOs, and improvements to the infrastructure for registering, identifying and protecting new arrivals.José Javier Sánchez Espinosa, the deputy director for migration at the Spanish Red Cross, said the challenges embodied by the plight of the Aquarius required an international response.“It’s not just a problem with Europe’s southern border or Spain’s, or with the Aquarius,” he said. “It’s a phenomenon that calls for a European solution at the very least. It’s about long-term global inequalities when it comes to economics and security.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31f8aab7aa823a12840adcdd18159f34d611b07d/0_81_4168_2500/master/4168.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1971ef2ffd057826c6c5bab9d0de74be","title":"ivan duque wins election to become colombias president","story":"Conservative opponent of Farc peace process wins long and isive campaignColombia has chosen Iván Duque, a conservative neophyte, to be its next president after a long and isive campaign that often centred on a controversial peace process with leftist rebels the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc).Colombia has experienced one of the longest internal conflicts in history. It started in the 1960s following a turbulent period known as \u0027la violencia\u0027.\u0026nbspOn the one hand, the Colombian government fought to maintain order and stability, seeking to protect the interests of its citizens and the legitimacy of the state.\u0026nbspOn the other, there were guerilla groups – like Farc and ELN – who said they were fighting for the poor and social justice.And then paramilitary groups emerged, claiming they were reacting to the threats from the guerillas while taking justice into their own hands.More than seven million people were uprooted from their homes and driven to cities fearing for their lives.\u0026nbspAt least two hundred thousand people lost their lives.Numerous human rights violations were committed. Hundreds of people were forcibly recruited and taken far into the Colombian jungle to fight. More than 8,000 cases of child recruitment were recorded.Overall, there have been more than eight million victims, due to the conflict. One out of every five Colombians has been directly affected.After talks lasting more than four years, a peace treaty was signed with Farc in November 2016 effectively bringing the conflict to an end. Key to the agreement are deals on rural development, political participation, illicit drugs and reparations for victims.Farc has given up all of their weapons (verified by the UN) and transitioned into a political party with a voice in the political process.With less money tied up in defence, the country\u0027s spending priorities should now be switching to education, health, infrastructure, the economy and the environment.\u0026nbspBut some are yet to experience \u0027peace\u0027. Scars are deep. Reconciliation, reintegration and access to opportunities take time. President Juan Manuel Santos is due to stand down in 2018 and some election campaigning has stoked concerns over the peace deal.Many now worry about the fate of the fragile peace deal signed with the Farc in 2016, which formally ended 52 years of civil war that left 220,000 dead and seven million displaced. That deal initially failed to pass a referendum with voters outraged by its guarantees of softer sentencing for rebel leaders and guaranteed seats in congress. It was later amended and ratified by lawmakers, a move some viewed as undemocratic. Sunday gave them another chance to voice their disquiet.Farc’s wartime leader, Rodrigo Londoño, tweeted after the result: “We have lived the quietest elections of the last decades, the peace process bears fruit. It is a moment of greatness and reconciliation, we respect the decision of the majorities and we congratulate the new president. Now to work, the roads of hope are open.”Duque promised on the campaign trail to modify the deal’s most contentious components, something that resonated with voters.On a clear Sunday morning in Bogotá’s central Ciudad Jardín neighbourhood, voters filed into a school repurposed as a voting station when polls opened at 8am. “I am voting for Ívan Duque,” said Marcelo Rodríguez, dressed in a Colombian football shirt. “I want peace but we can’t have it without justice.”Others at the poll station were less convinced. “Amending a deal is the same as tearing it up,” said Andrea Gómez, a student. “Some people in Colombia won’t be happy without war.”Duque – who will turn 42 just before taking office on 8 August – will be Colombia’s youngest ever president, though his party, Democratic Center, has a coalition in Congress. He also has the backing of several industry leaders and, perhaps most importantly, ex-president Alvaro Uribe, still an immensely powerful – if isive – figure in Colombian politics.Uribe, who dealt severe military blows to the Farc during his tenure from 2002 to 2010, led the campaign against the peace deal in 2016’s referendum. He was Duque’s earliest champion for president, having persuaded his protege to leave a job at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington DC to fill a party senate seat in 2014.Duque’s opponents say is little more to than Uribe’s puppet, a charge particularly worrying given the hardline svengali’s authoritarian tendencies. While president, a state intelligence agency was shut down after Uribe used it to spy on the opposition, journalists and members of the supreme court. His military campaign against the rebels was marked by grave human rights abuses: thousands of civilians were murdered in order to falsely inflate combat statistics.Both men denied the charge, and accused Petro of being the real threat to democracy. Uribe, after voting in Bogotá’s historic Plaza de Bolívar, said that Duque was the only bulwark against Petro’s “destructive socialism” – the same force he said has mired neighbouring Venezuela in economic and political turmoil.Petro was reluctant on the campaign trail to distance himself from Venezuela’s late president Hugo Chávez, and with 1 million Venezuelans having fled to Colombia, many here worry that Petro could bring a similar fate.Duque’s market-friendly economic policies appealed to voters near the Venezuelan border, though younger and more moderate voters worry about his conservative social policies from drug policy and crime to abortion.The campaign was long and ugly, with stark polarisation revealed in the first round when Duque and Petro eliminated a handful of more moderate rivals. Now, Duque’s job will be build bridges between Colombians ided on ideology and the peace process, with the worst outcome being another flare up of civil war.“Polarisation is common in politics around the world,” Pedro Piedrahita Bustamente, a political science professor at the University of Medellín previously told the . “But here, where there is a history of internal armed conflict, it could be a dangerous thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b4828d5ee366798bf1ffcce4b74f962ee06b73e/0_156_3515_2110/master/3515.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026amp;s=d877e6ac78d63c7e12a38269cc955232","title":"kaliningrad nuclear bunker russia satellite photos report","story":"Satellite images from Baltic outpost and World Cup venue are latest sign of Russian emphasis on nuclear armsRussia appears to have upgraded a nuclear weapons storage bunker in its Kaliningrad enclave, in the latest sign of Moscow’s increased emphasis on nuclear arms in its standoff with Nato, according to a new report.The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) will publish satellite images on Monday which the group says show a storage facility in the Baltic coast enclave between Poland and Lithuania being deepened and then covered with a new concrete roof in recent months.“It has all the fingerprints of typical Russian nuclear weapons storage sites,” said Hans Kristensen, the director of the nuclear information project at FAS. “There is a heavy duty external perimeter of multilayered fencing. The bunkers themselves have triple fencing around them as well. These are typical features from all the other nuclear weapons storage sites that we know about in Russia.”The work on the bunker began in 2016, and the new roof was put on earlier in the summer.“Its a site we have been monitoring for quite some time and there have been and there have been some upgrades in the past but nothing as dramatic as this one. This is the first time we’ve seen one of the nuclear bunkers being excavated and apparently renovated,” Kristensen said.“These pictures don’t prove that there are nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad now, but they do show it is an active site,” Kristensen said. He said it was unclear whether the Russian military already had nuclear warheads at the site, or that they are about to bring them in or whether the facility was being upgraded so that nuclear weapons could be moved in at short notice.Kaliningrad, formerly the East Prussian outpost of Königsberg, is currently in the public eye as one of the venues for the football World Cup. It is also emerging as a critical square on the east European chessboard in Vladimir Putin’s efforts to push back assertively against Nato expansion. The Russian military announced in January this year that the necessary infrastructure had been built to accommodate a permanent presence of mobile Iskander-M missiles, capable of carrying conventional and nuclear warheads a range of 500 km. The missiles were due to be combat ready early this year.The US says that because of their range, the Iskanders represent a violation of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. Kaliningrad also serves as a base for Russia’s Baltic fleet.Unlike Nato, the Russian military, particularly its navy, has kept many of its tactical weapons systems nuclear capable, including anti-ship missiles, short range land-attack missiles and even air defences. As tensions with the west have escalated over Ukraine and Syria, Vladimir Putin has put more emphasis on Russia’s nuclear arsenal. In March this year, Putin unveiled a range of new nuclear weapon designs which he claimed could overcome any western defences.Kristensen said it was unclear what kind of warheads, the renovated bunker in Kaliningrad is meant to serve, but it is much closer to the naval base that the missile base, which is further inland.

A second man, Motochika Goto, 85, was crushed by a falling bookcase at his home.The quake, which did not trigger a tsunami, left more than 170,000 households without power in Osaka prefecture and neighbouring Hyogo prefecture, where an earthquake killed more than 6,400 people in the city of Kobe in January 1995.Monday’s earthquake was of a relatively low magnitude but caused violent shaking due to its shallow depth of 13km. It registered up to a lower-6 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 0 to 7. Quakes of a lower-6 intensity make it hard for people to stay on their feet and can topple unsecured furniture and other items.Officials warned of possible strong aftershocks. “There are fears that the risk of house collapses and landslides has increased in the areas shaken strongly,” said Toshiyuki Matsumori of the country’s meteorological agency. “Please make sure that you are fully on alert about seismic activities and information on rainfall, and stay clear of dangerous places.”Experts said the earthquake could have involved a fault that has not moved for more than 10,000 years. “We may have to consider the possibility of even greater earthquakes following, as happened in the quakes in Kumamoto,” Kyodo news quoted Shinji Toda, an earthquake geology professor at Tohoku University, as saying.Dozens of people were killed in Kumamoto in south-western Japan in April 2016 after two powerful earthquakes struck within two days of each other.TV coverage of the immediate aftermath of the Osaka quake showed ruptured underground pipes spewing water on to the street, while firefighters were seen tackling a blaze at a home on the city’s northern outskirts. A number of other fires were reported.Kansai Electric Power said no irregularities had been detected at three nuclear plants in the region. Several rail services were suspended, including the bullet train. Television images showed passengers getting off trains and walking along the tracks between stations.The car manufacturer Daihatsu said it had suspended operations at its plants in Osaka and nearby Kyoto, while the consumer electronics firm Sharp said its factories were operating normally. “I saw the ceiling and the floor undulating, and I could barely stand. I was very scared,” Katsufumi Abe, who was at Osaka’s main railway station when the quake struck, told Kyodo.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said the government was assessing the damage and that its priority was to rescue anyone trapped inside buildings. He said he had instructed officials to “swiftly collect information on the damage, do their utmost to rescue people and save lives… and provide timely information to the public”.An American visitor to the city described being woken up by violent shaking. “We were sleeping and it woke us up abruptly,” Kate Kilpatrick, who was staying in a hotel in Osaka, told Reuters. “It was so terrifying because this is my first earthquake. I thought it was a nightmare because I was so confused. The whole world was aggressively shaking.”Some residents said their homes had not suffered structural damage but that the shaking had sent objects flying off shelves.Monday’s earthquake was the third measuring higher than magnitude-4 to have struck Japan – one of the world’s most seismically active countries – in recent days.In March 2011, a magnitude-9 earthquake triggered a tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people along Japan’s north-east coast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34dca697c22b172d14ef0503b9dddb339f8055fc/0_18_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40bed16c78a7ce48802a09e7f5f1c49a","title":"the good men inside the all male group taking on modern masculinity","story":"In the hometown of Jordan Peterson, the evangelist of white male resentment, a different and thoughtful men’s movement vies to be heardOn a warm Tuesday evening, a dozen men gathered on couches at a Lululemon location in Toronto called The Local. Since last year, as an experiment to reach more male customers, the store has been home to The Huddle, a male bonding group which meets Tuesday nights after closing to work out, run, or meditate.But once a month, the men circle up to talk about, well, their feelings.Downtempo jazz and cartons of maple sap water greeted me as I plunked myself down next to a young man who recently quit his job to become a freelance cinematographer. The evening’s facilitator, Alex Cameron, a man with hulking, tattoo-plastered arms and slicked-back salt-and-pepper hair, told us the theme for this session: emotional literacy. Cameron, who is 40, runs a psychotherapy practice nearby.To start off, Joe, a slight man in a hoodie, volunteered a story about how he came to realize that vulnerability was a strength rather than weakness. “I’ve never shared this in front of a group before,” said Joe, 34, who told us the story of his mother passing away when he was three how his dad became hardened and distant and how, at the age of 27, he found himself in deep depression.“I was single, in a job I hated, with very few friends I could count on. I felt like we are all going to die anyways, so what’s the purpose of trying?”Uncovering blocked emotions, Joe told us, saved his life. “I realized if I wasn’t going to take my life, I had to go back in time and work through my feelings. I was a 27-year-old living in a little boy’s trauma. I needed to prove to myself that it was safe to feel again.”We went around the circle sharing whatever came to mind about manhood, emotions, relationships, Donald Trump, Justin Trudeau, Jordan Peterson, the fact that most mass shootings are committed by socially isolated white men.“Conversations with other men are usually very superficial,” said Marvin, a transplant from Germany who works at an ad agency.“It’s always about sex and money,” the man next to him added. (Some of the participants declined to be named for this story.) “Like, ‘Oh, I got laid last night’. It gets boring.”“It’s not only fucking boring, it’s unhealthy,” said Marvin. “Most men suffer alone.”The discussion shifted to the meaning of anger.“I played football growing up and I learned that, as a man, you kept things inside so you could use them as a weapon. But emotions are energy and they have to move, they have to be released,” said Chris, who recently returned from a chakra retreat in Belize. Many men never learn “how to release that energy without using force”.“Anger is like an iceberg,” Alex Cameron, the therapist leading the session, told us. “Anger is what you see, but it comes from everything else below the surface – shame, fear, guilt. For most men, it feels safer to get angry than express sadness or vulnerability.”He wrapped up on a more personal note. “When I feel vulnerable, I cry. It looks like sadness on the outside, but it feels powerful.”I’ve dropped in on The Huddle several times over the past six months. One meeting focused on mental health and substance abuse a former drug addict shared the story of his attempted suicide and recent recovery. Another served as a #MeToo confessional. “I bet every man in here has a story about how they’ve mistreated a woman,” the facilitator prodded. After a deafening silence, one man threw up his hands. “I know I’ve done some foul shit.” Lululemon’s e into the murk of modern masculinity is a hipster-approved strand in a longer lineage of male reckoning.Alongside the din of women’s lib in the late 1960s was the lesser known men’s liberation movement. “Male liberation calls for men to free themselves from the sex role stereotypes that limit their ability to be human,” wrote psychologist Jack Sawyer, an early proponent, in a 1970 issue of Liberation magazine. “The battle of women to be free need not be a battle against men as oppressors. The choice about whether men are the enemy is up to men themselves.” Today the pro-feminist men’s movement champions causes ranging from reducing violence against women to raising awareness about male suicide and prostate cancer. Adherents dwell in gender studies programs, social justice groups, and mental health organizations—and in small groups of men who gather in coffee shops and living rooms for heartfelt talk. Pro-feminist masculinity has remained relatively obscure, though #MeToo may be changing that.“It’s allowed male feminists like myself to come out of the shadows,” Michael Kehler, a University of Calgary masculinities studies professor, told me by phone. His career, after two decades of “quiet, diligent work to move this agenda forward,” has flowered with media requests and speaking engagements. In January, Kehler became North America’s first masculinities studies research chair. Kehler believes this older breed of masculinity is dying. Some evidence, however, suggests otherwise.Pro-feminist men feel that by modulating hypermasculinity, and ceding a wider wedge of societal power to women, they can clear a path to male enlightenment – something good for men and women. Known as the men’s rights movement, these ad-hoc, mainly internet-based activists are resistant to policies promoting women’s equality and to the men-as-oppressors narrative generally. Oddly enough, the movement’s ideological godfather, Warren Farrell, was a well-known male feminist in the seventies who marched alongside Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem. By the time Farrell’s 1993 book The Myth of Male Power arrived on shelves, his metamorphosis was complete: “What we, as feminists, did is put men into the oppressor class and called it patriarchy,” he once said of his previous self.While some strands of the men’s rights movement tout their efforts to provide men’s shelters, male-centric mental health services, and legal support in paternity cases, others are openly misogynist.“Pussy is the only real empowerment women will ever know,” wrote Paul Elam, the founder of AVoiceForMen, to promote the website’s “slap-a-violent-bitch month” in 2017. “Put all the hopelessly wishful thinking of feminist ideology aside and what remains is the fact that it is men and pretty much men only who draw power from accomplishment, who invent technology, build nations, cure disease, create empires and generally advance civilization.” Elam’s online community has been deemed a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.ReturnOfKings, a blog for “pickup artists” (men focused on manipulating women into sex), has also earned this distinction. The website’s founder, Daryush Valizadeh, even suggested rape should be legal “if done on private property”. Also in the constellation of men’s rights groups are “incels” – men who blame women for their inability to attract a mate. (The word is a contraction of “involuntary celibate”.) The online subculture reached notoriety in April when 25-year-old Alek Minassian drove into two dozen pedestrians in Toronto. Eight of the 10 killed were women. “The Incel Rebellion has already begun,” Minassian posted on Facebook moments before he rammed his rental van into a Yonge Street sidewalk.Jahmal Padmore, one of the organizers of The Huddle, believes that blaming women, or anyone, does not dissolve one’s woes so much as harden them. The bespectacled, well-muscled 34-year-old gently badgers his male friends to show up for The Huddle because he knows firsthand how difficult it is to reach out for support. “Black kids can’t afford therapy – if we’re going to get fixed, we have to do it ourselves,” Padmore, the son of Antiguan immigrants, told me. “So I just went on YouTube and watched a lot of personal development videos.” Padmore’s craving for self-discovery accelerated as he approached his 30th birthday. He was drinking heavily and had some brushes with mental illness. One day he came across a series of videos by the University of Toronto psychology professor Jordan Peterson, focused on men’s pain. Padmore was hooked – briefly. “Peterson talked about finding your personal capacity within. I love that, that’s real, that’s what a lot of young men are looking for. When guys are maturing and coming to terms with the fact that they’re not going to be an NBA star, or whatever dreams or expectations they had aren’t being fulfilled, it can be painful. And because we’re men, we’re socialized to not express those feelings of frustration in a healthy way.”In the early 2010s, the eccentric professor was known for TedX talks with innocuous, New Age titles like “Potential” and “Redefining Reality”. But Peterson also had a reputation for blistering attacks on male laziness – “Clean up your room!” he often barks at his young followers – and criticizing political correctness.In 2016 Peterson’s viral popularity exploded after he protested Bill C-16, legislation adding gender identity to the characteristics protected by Canadian anti-discrimination law. The publication of his book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos in January this year vaulted Peterson into international stardom.While Peterson maintains the persona of a self-help guru styled as a stern but loving father figure – “To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life,” he writes – the threads of intolerance in his work, and the rhetoric of some of his followers, teeter toward hate.In a recent New York Times profile, Peterson surmised that the Toronto van attacker “was angry at God because women were rejecting him”. He suggested “enforced monogamy” as a societal cure for incels and other disgruntled young men. Peterson has never hidden his view that women should submit to conventional gender roles, but in May he published a chummy 90-minute interview with Warren Farrell, cementing his affinity with the men’s rights movement.Another reason he quickly fell from the orbit of Peterson’s charisma: “I’m black.”Doing pro-feminist men’s work under corporate auspices comes with certain pitfalls. The Huddle is free of charge, but when Padmore shouts “Hit me up if you want a discount on some stretchy pants,” one can’t but feel like the target of a sophisticated marketing scheme.The corporation in question also has some skeletons in its closet.Lululemon’s founder, Chip Wilson, once suggested that breast cancer rates rose in the nineties because of “cigarette-smoking Power Women who were on the pill…and taking on the stress previously left to men in the working world”. He said that Lululemon clothing was not for plus-sized or even average-sized women. In 2015, after being forced to recall a number of yoga pants with a conspicuous defect – they became see-through in the crotch after a short period of use – Wilson resigned.In 2016, a supervisor at a Lululemon in California was accused of raping a female co-worker. The victim’s lawsuit painted the company as a haven for sexual predators – a place, BuzzFeed wrote, “where women are encouraged to wear tight clothes to work, lewd comments go unchecked, and hookups between bosses and subordinates are accepted as par for the course after a wild night of drinking”.This February, Wilson’s replacement as CEO, Laurent Potdevin, was also forced out for misconduct, possibly because of a relationship with a subordinate. (Further details have not yet emerged.)When I contacted Lululemon headquarters to ask how the company reconciled its brand identity as a beacon of yogic enlightenment with its reputation as a bastion of toxic masculinity, a PR rep supplied me with a statement attributed to Ben Stubbington, senior vice president of men’s design:Padmore, unwilling to defend the company, took a more prosaic stance. “I’m not particularly concerned with Lululemon’s past, present, or future image I’m concerned with showing up and doing things that impact people’s lives in a positive way.” He said he hasn’t seen any signs of a culture of toxic masculinity at the company since being hired a year ago.The righteous aren’t immune to hypocrisy, he added. “I think a lot of liberal white folks get caught up in perfection. You’re going to make mistakes, you’re going to fuck up. But I think you have to be okay with that and keep pushing forward.”If the various men’s movement subcultures are in competition for followers, the pro-feminist folks are losing badly. Jordan Peterson has 1.2 million followers on YouTube and more than 700,000 on Twitter. Prominent pro-feminist male personalities count four or five digits at most.Jeff Perera, a figure in Toronto’s pro-feminist men’s community, told me he hasn’t won any converts from the Peterson camp, but has occasionally lost friends who “converted to the other side”.“We put out a lot of statistics about the unfortunate realities women go through, which are important for men to hear,” Perera said. “The problem is a lot of men don’t want to hear some expert telling them what a shitty person they are. They’re like, ‘Yeah, I wasn’t planning on raping anyone today, so peace out’.”Around the time Trump was elected, Perera, 42, worked part-time for Next Gen Men, a non-profit that works with teenage boys to get them thinking outside the gender box. During one afterschool program at an elite prep school outside Toronto, the conversation, Perera recalled, turned to the new US president.“I described him as the ‘televangelist of toxic masculinity’. I said to the guys, ‘He’s like Cobra Commander from GI Joe – he has to have his supervillain logo on everything from his helicopter to his evil headquarters at Trump Tower’. One of the boys looked at me with kind of a deadpan stare, and was like, ‘That’s actually kind of cool’. It was this moment where I had a crisis of faith. I realized that the movement is failing.”The coolness quotient of the pro-feminist men’s world, at least in the eyes of the average adolescent male, is rather low. Attendees of the annual conference put on by the National Organization of Men Against Sexism are likely to be treated to rousing renditions of songs like “Let the Woman In You Come Through” or “Womb Envy”. One can imagine howls of laughter from 16-year-olds forced to sing along to “It’s Only A Wee-Wee, So What’s the Big Deal?”Which is why it may not be a bad thing for a trendy, globally recognized brand, however imperfect, to take up the torch.Jian Pablico, who originated The Huddle at Lululemon’s Vancouver headquarters, told me his role as a “mindful performance manager” is to “curate” non-traditional masculinity for “men who may not be part of that culture yet”. That’s why the touchy-feely talks are held only one day a month.“We wanted to find a way to bring people together who might be hesitant about showing up for a conversation on vulnerability,” Pablico said. “Sweating together first helps it come naturally. Once you suffer together in a workout, you begin to bond and a layer of the mask comes off. It’s then a little easier to chat afterwards over a beer. Or a kombucha.”Jordan Peterson views feminism as an emasculating force. He believes men ought to be allowed to be unapologetically tough, ambitious, competitive, and forceful.But no one in the pro-feminist camp has really suggested that men can’t be tough, ambitious, competitive, or forceful – only that it is unhealthy to suppress other ways of being.After his Huddle session on emotional literacy, Alex Cameron, the therapist, showed me his tattoos. I’d assumed they were a relic from some previous life as a bouncer or lumberjack. It turns out he got them on graduating his master’s in social work. One arm depicts a dragon, symbol of virility the other, a phoenix, which in Chinese mythology signifies feminine grace.“We have opposing sides within us,” Cameron said. Harmony, he believes, must come from “embracing our entire self”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bbbe6754421827f4d83a9e9bb311b5ddea51079/758_23_4783_2869/master/4783.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc7031e1762a81c30d842ae0114c16b4","title":"turkey islamists and secularists join forces in bid to unseat erdogan","story":"Presidential contender Temel Karamollaoğlu tells the  he hopes to weaken Erdoğan’s hold on powerThe leader of Turkey’s largest Islamist party rattled off what he believes to be the failures of president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government: a high unemployment rate, a widening trade deficit, a chaotic foreign policy, a stalled European Union membership application and a state of emergency since the failed 2016 coup – all of which have damaged fundamental rights and freedoms.Temel Karamollaoğlu, the Manchester-educated head of the Saadet (Felicity) party, says it is for these reasons and more that he is running for president. He has also allied with staunch secularists in the race for parliament – a coalition that would have been unimaginable a decade ago. Two weeks before presidential and parliamentary elections, the race is unexpectedly tightening.Although Erdoğan remains the most powerful and popular politician in Turkey, his opponents have performed exceptionally well in opinion polls, with recent ones suggesting the legislative hold of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) could be broken.In an environment of declining freedom of expression and purges of dissidents as well as growing displays of public piety in a country where secularism is enshrined in its founding principles, a consistent voice of opposition has emerged from an unlikely quarter. Islamists, who were once ideological allies of the president, have joined the alliance trying to weaken his hold on power.“The policies that Erdoğan or his government are following do not help Turkey stand up on her own feet in almost all aspects and policies, whether economic or foreign policies,” Karamollaoğlu told the . “His method of approach, the discourse, causes polarisation in Turkey. He is in great extent disrespectful to the upholding of law.”Karamollaoğlu’s party was once led by Necmettin Erbakan, the father of Turkey’s modern political Islamist movement, one-time prime minister and former mentor of Erdoğan. Erdoğan and other key figures in the movement, who were seen as more reform-minded at the time, split off to form the AKP, which has ruled Turkey since 2002.Turkey’s president likes to portray himself as the global defender of Islam and has sought to position himself as a champion of Muslim causes and a leader of a solidarity movement for the oppressed faithful around the world, another stance that plays well with conservative voters.Karamollaoğlu said his party’s vision for Turkey is one of UK-style secularism in which religion and the state can co-exist peaceably, a self-sufficient economy and a foreign policy based on dialogue and diplomacy, with closer ties to Muslim nations. He wants to abandon the pursuit of EU membership in favour of a special status agreement, as well as the strategic alliance with the US that is already frayed under Erdoğan.For the elections, the Felicity party has entered an alliance with the main secular opposition bloc, the Republican People’s party (CHP). The Islamists and secularists make for unlikely bedfellows, united by their opposition to the president and his ruling party, despite their bitter ideological disparity.The oddity of the pairing belies the broader campaign to draw away voters from Erdoğan’s religiously conservative base, which has reliably voted for him.His strongest rivals in the presidential race are making implicit appeals to religious voters by signalling their own piety. Meral Aksener, the leader of a new nationalist party, points out that she performed the pilgrimage to Mecca and, though she does not wear the veil, she regularly performs daily prayers. Muharrem Ince, the CHP’s candidate, attends Friday prayers.Karamollaoğlu’s candidacy and vociferous opposition to the AKP’s policies also blurs the traditional iding lines of Turkish politics, and marks a public disavowal of the idea that Erdoğan is the only legitimate champion of the pious.Religious voters often point to Erdoğan’s personal piety as a factor in his appeal, as well as his support for Islamist causes like the headscarf, which under the ruling AKP was allowed in universities and state institutions.To many conservative voters, Erdoğan’s rise signalled that public displays of faith had become mainstream, after decades of the vilification of religion and its adherents. It was a repudiation of the “White Turks”, the secular elite who controlled the military and the state’s bureaucracy and looked down on their religious countrymen as ignorant and poor.Distrust will continue to pose a challenge to opposition parties who want to draw in conservatives in sufficient numbers to tip the scales.They hope, for example, that conservative voters in Kurdish areas who have long voted for the AKP will vote for other parties this time around, due to a combination of Erdoğan’s electoral alliance with the nationalists, Turkey’s military operations against Kurdish militias in Syria, and the sweeping crackdown on dissident Kurds, as well as the failed promise of the inclusive vision of Turkey once espoused by Erdoğan’s AKP."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3072115.1493933893!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ul makes settlements of up to 150 000 with whistleblowers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Department of Education is to launch an independent inquiry into a series of allegations of misconduct at University of Limerick (UL).The University of Limerick (UL) has made financial settlements in the region of €150,000 with three key whistleblowers who highlighted a series of allegations over the misspending of taxpayers’ money.The move followed mediation talks and the publication of an independent report which vindicated some of their allegations regarding the university’s finance, human resources and governance policies.Among its findings were that more than €1.7 million has been spent on severance packages for eight former employees between 2008 and 2015.UL president Dr Des Fitzgerald has confirmed that settlements have been made in the cases of the three women who formerly worked in the college’s finance section.A spokesman for the university declined to say how much they were paid beyond saying the financial element was “similar in each case and is not excessive”.One of the settlements is understood to be the region of €50,000-€60,000, so an overall package is likely to be in the region of €150,000.Dr Fitzgerald, who took over as president a year ago, said it has been his priority to get to the bottom of the allegations and put in place checks to ensure mistakes are not repeated.He has accepted the university made serious mistakes in the past and apologised for hurt caused to all those affected.Leona O’Callaghan, one of the whistle-blowers whose allegations were vindicated, said she felt satisfied the university had now taken steps to tackle the issues, although she felt disappointed there had been no “inidual accountability”.Two other whistleblowers, known as ‘B’ and ‘C’ in an investigation, were suspended on full pay for 2½ years. Their suspensions were lifted as part of the settlement.Meanwhile, The  understands that the Comptroller and Auditor General is finalising an investigation into severance payments by UL to former staff.It is understood that education authorities were kept in the dark over some of the payments, which may have breached pay policy guidelines. Some of these staff were later rehired on lucrative contracts.If the university is found to have formally breached pay guidelines, UL may face financial penalties from the Higher Education Authority.This is under new a new funding model adopted by the authority which came into force recently.The move to introduce penalties for governance issues follows a number of controversies involving higher education institutions over recent years.This penalty-based system may be used for “clear and unambiguous breaches of governance”.The authority is understood to have discussed the possibility recently, though officials are mindful that any penalty could end up depriving funds to support vulnerable students.In an interview, Dr Fitzgerald said underfunding of the higher education sector was putting strain on teaching and learning across the sector. It was also contributing to one in five students dropping out of college at UL.“It . . . affects our ability to deliver new programmes and impacts on our ability to provide problem-based learning and experiential learning . . . there’s one class with over 700 students.” He said he did not support the introduction of a loan scheme for students."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3534020.1529262774!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"university of limerick seeks to rebuild trust after controversies","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Des Fitzgerald, president of University of Limerick, says his priority has been to deal with damaging revelations involving the college. Photograph: Alan PlaceThe walls of the University of Limerick (UL) president’s office are plastered with Post-It notes, maps, flow charts and lists of faculty members.Dr Des Fitzgerald has no shortage of plans for the university, but much of his time has been spent mired in a swamp of allegations over misspending and poor human resources practices.The first year of his presidency has involved trying to get to the bottom of murky practices such as excessive payouts for former staff members, a VIP-style expenses system for senior staff and attempts to silence or “manage out” whistle-blowers.In total, the university spent more than €1.7 million on severance packages for eight former employees between 2008 and 2015.Some of these former staff were subsequently rehired on lucrative contracts. Education authorities were kept in the dark over the payments, which breached pay policy guidelines.The details shook confidence not just in UL, but in the wider third-level system at a time when the sector needed an urgent injection of State funding.Dr Fitzgerald, previously a senior academic at UCD and one of the country’s top researchers, says his focus has been on dealing with all the issues in an open and transparent way.“My priority was to try to find out what happened, begin the process of fixing it and making sure we dealt with people who had grievances in a systematic way,” he says.There have been sweeping changes to the college’s management and governance structures this year with expertise in audit and risk. There has also been mediation and financial settlements with whistle-blowers, who first drew attention to many of these issues.“All those changes have been aimed at bringing in oversight to ensure that it never happens again,” he says.Rebuilding trust for UL, and the wider third-level sector, will be crucial if higher education is to secure extra State funding.There is little doubt that it is hurting. Core State funding since the financial crisis is down by close to 30 per cent, while students numbers have grown significantly.While the idea of a student loan scheme has been floated as one way of helping to bridge the funding gap for higher education, Fitzgerald is opposed to such as move.He feels a publicly-funded system – as is the norm across most of Europe – is the best way forward.“I think loans could be barrier for students . . . just 27 per cent of school leavers in Limerick city go to university that’s one of worst statistics in terms of access nationally.”Instead, he says higher levels of State funding, along with tight spending rules, are required. At the same time, colleges should be given greater autonomy to hire additional staff if they can demonstrate they are performing well.The consequences of underfunding for higher education, he says, are plain to see in terms of students falling through the cracks.“We’re not providing the sort of services and student experience that we would like to . . . that can affect the number of people who are progressing and completing their courses. Our non-completion rate is 20 per cent. We could do a lot more on the student experience and engagement,” he says.“It also affects our ability to deliver new programmes and impacts on our ability to provide problem-based learning and experiential learning . . . there’s one class with over 700 students – it’s impossible for anyone to learn properly in that environment.”Student numbers at the university, perched on the edge of Limerick city, are projected to grow by 30 per cent over the next decade, up from 15,000 to 20,000.Yet State funding for capital projects has been virtually non-existent for the past decade.Notwithstanding that, there are ambitious plans for the expansion of UL into the heart of the city and in a new “university town” on the ClareLimerick border.Dr Fitzgerald says the university is in discussions with Clare County Council about a special development zone.“The idea is to create a university town: a space where people would move in to work, live go to school and participate in all the things that a university can offer: sports, arts, education and so on.”It would require a new norther distributor road, off the N7, to open up the land for development.Despite the challenges, he is defiantly upbeat for the future of the university and its students.He says they have some of the best employability rates, with 74 per cent of graduates securing work and 20 per cent going on to do post-grads.In addition, he sees a growing role for the university in providing upskilling and lifelong learning for employees in the workplace."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3533953.1529257995!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland second worst in eu on climate change action","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe report says Ireland has an “impressive potential” of integrating high levels of renewables, especially wind power. Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill  The Ireland is the second-worst performing EU member state in tackling climate change, both in terms of national action and support for greater ambition, according to Europe’s largest NGO coalition working on climate and energy issues.The 2018 Off Target report published on Monday by Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, which is supported by the European Commission, concludes all EU member states are falling short in adopting the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and in pursuing efforts to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees.CAN, however, reserves most criticism for Ireland, along with many central and eastern European countries, because of “stiff opposition” to climate actions. Without new, immediate and substantive efforts to cut emissions, it warns Ireland “faces annual non-compliance costs of around €500 million”.It assessed and rated the role member states play in setting ambitious EU climate and energy targets and policies, and what progress they are making in reducing emissions and promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency at home.It rates Ireland second last to Poland. “Ireland is set to miss its 2020 climate and renewable energy targets and is also off-course for its unambitious 2030 emissions target,” it warns.Emissions from the transport and agriculture sectors are increasing significantly, while the Government “has failed to prepare effective policies to align near-term climate action with EU and Paris Agreement commitments”.At EU level, it says Ireland “failed to join the group of progressive EU member states calling for increased EU climate ambition and played a negative role in the negotiations of the EU 2030 climate and energy legislation, pushing for loopholes to dilute the laws”.The report acknowledges, however, “the Irish electricity grid has an impressive potential of integrating high levels of renewables, especially wind power, which can still be further developed”.The Government needs to radically revise its National Mitigation Plan (NMP) to reduce carbon emissions – currently subject to legal challenge – and immediately put in place measures in the transport and agriculture sectors, it recommends.All use of peat in electricity generation needs to end by 2019 and coal use by 2025, the report adds – a tighter schedule than envisaged.Ireland needs to join the group of progressive EU member states calling for increased EU climate ambition and deliver urgent, near-term emissions reductions, CAN concludes.“Ireland’s poor position stems from dismal progress on 2020 climate and renewable energy targets, rising emissions from the transport and agriculture sectors, the absence of effective policies, and a failure to support greater ambition in EU 2030 climate and energy legislation,” the Irish environmental alliance Stop Climate Chaos said in response to the findings.The report welcomes the innovative deliberative process of the Citizens’ Assembly and recommends the Government “now radically revise its climate action plan (the NMP) on the basis of the assembly proposals on climate change”.The 2015 Paris Agreement, and committing to pursue efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, “was a major step forward in safeguarding our planet’s future”, the report says. “Yet the contributions proposed at the Paris talks are nowhere close enough to keep temperature rise below this threshold. Hence the EU, like all other countries in the world, needs to urgently and substantially increase its action, well beyond the currently agreed targets.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses after man\u0026rsquos wife finds his body on the roadside in Liscarroll, Co CorkPassenger fatally injured after vehicle hits bridge in early hours of Monday morningReaction to CAN report: Political leadership \u0026lsquourgently needed\u0026rsquo to turn record aroundVideo game concerns are dovetailing with scrutiny over harmful aspects of technologyConsultants \u0026lsquocannot hang around at pinnacle of careers waiting for things to improve\u0026rsquoFianna F\u0026aacuteil expresses concerns about Britain\u0026rsquos capacity to maintain standardsMove follows allegations of misspending taxpayers\u0026rsquo money at University of LimerickNiall Burgess identifies gaps in Spanish and Chinese as missions set to increaseCatholic couple evicted from Caledon 50 years ago recall their terror at the experienceWarning of annual non-compliance costs of about \u0026euro500 million unless measures takenIssues include Billy Caldwell case, Grenfell Tower fire, abortion and restoring StormontDocument distributed in error has notes on Brexit, abortion and other contentious issuesMinister wants to see \u0026lsquohighest standards achieved by dog-breeding establishments\u0026rsquoPost office sales remain most popular way of paying the chargeIrish Property Owners\u0026rsquo Association says it has no issue with new proposalsCounty by county performance on illegal dumping to be documented by RT\u0026Eacute programmeNew building will be biggest ever capital investment by Department of Foreign AffairsVaradkar adopts benign D\u0026aacuteil approach to possible post-election supportersIbiza flight from Dublin rerouted after group of up to 20 holidaymakers involved in disturbance"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3534111.1529273107!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"full text of northern secretary s leaked briefings on crunch ni issues","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCharlotte Caldwell, and her son Billy, from Co Tyrone,  stand outside the Home Office during a break in a meeting with officials to discuss how Billy can have his severe epilepsy treated with cannabis oil,  a banned substance in Britain, in London, June 11th, 2018.

The report on the views of those living on both sides of the border was completed by researchers at Queen’s University Belfast. It indicated that half of residents are against a technological solution to custom checks.The government has been criticised for not allowing time to debate the Irish border during a series of key Brexit votes at Westminster. Only 15 minutes was set aside for debating changes to devolved powers proposed by the Lords in the EU Withdrawal bill.SNP MPs walked out of the House of Commons chamber during PMQs on 13 June 2018, after their Westminster leader Ian Blackford was removed by the Speaker.Not giving Blackford the opportunity to speak?Not true. The SNP was about to be granted a debate on how the devolution aspects of the EU Withdrawal Bill.Disappointing that they chose not to take this opportunity to take this forward.Will their debate be granted?Understand a debate under SO24 has been granted. Entirely a matter for the Speaker of the House.Almost no debate yesterday on the important issue of the role devolved administrations will play in the Brexit process?The House agreed to the Programme Motion which allocated enough time to discuss devolved matters in the Bill. However, due to the number of isions pushed to a vote this time was restricted. This was not a decision or choice by the Government.On further engagement with DAs:Our amendment respects the devolution settlement – as agreed with the Welsh Government.We spent the last year negotiating with the Welsh and Scottish Governments and the amendment we have put forward sees the vast majority of EU powers with devolved responsibilities automatically flow to Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh. We look forward to continuing to work closely with the Scottish Government to create the UK-wide legal frameworks we need to protect the UK internal market – a market which is vital for business and jobs in Scotland. Digital Registration and the electoral consultation responseContext: Electoral digital registration which has been available in GB since 2014 is being rolled out to NI on Monday 18th by the Chief Electoral Officer. Digital registration is not replacing the paper application system which remains in place for those that wish to use it but we expect that as in the rest of the UK the majority of people will chose to use the new online system to register. All the parties have welcomed the introduction of the system.The consultation response, although containing no decisions, will be more controversial. It will be interpreted as opening the door to the closure of regional electoral offices. It is important to be clear that decisions on the future structure of the Electoral Office are and operational matter for the CEO not matters for ministers. I would like to take this opportunity welcome today’s launch of digital registration. This is an exciting step forward for NI. People will be able to register to vote quickly and easily on their phone, tablet or computer anywhere that is convenient for them. It provides for NI the same element of choice that is already available to the rest of the UK.  I am aware that the response to the consultation on the future of electoral delivery in NI has been published today. It will now be for the Chief Electoral Officer to consider how she wishes to move forward. The Electoral Office is independent. Decisions on the structure and makeup of the Electoral Office are operational matters for the CEO. Digital registration will be an additional option to paper registration – it won’t replace it, so those who wish to continue to register by post in person can do so.Further delay in MLA payContext: The News Letter’s Sam McBride wrote on 15 June 2018 that the Secretary of State has “declined to explain what has cause months of delay in cutting the pay of MLAs while Stormont lies empty”.The Secretary of State has made clear that she is minded to reduce MLA pay in line with the recommendations of Trevor Reaney. This remains her position. Context: A 12-year-old boy from County Tyrone has suffered an epileptic seizure hours after cannabis oil brought from Canada was confiscated at Heathrow Airport, his mother has said. Charlotte Caldwell said her son Billy had suffered a “small 30 second seizure”, the first in almost a year, on Tuesday morning. The cannabis oil was removed from Ms Caldwell at the airport on Monday. She has called on Home Office minister Nick Hurd to return the medication. Ms Caldwell posted a video of her son having the seizure on social media. Nick Hurd met Ms Caldwell on Monday and advised her that despite these extremely difficult circumstances, it is unlawful to possess Schedule 1 drugs such as those seized at the border on Monday morning, without a licence. The Minister urged the family to explore licensing options with the Department of Health Northern Ireland. This is a Home Office lead, but we can provide the following lines should we be asked for comment: Any parent will want to do whatever they can to alleviate the symptoms of their child when suffering from a debilitating illness. Nevertheless, it is important that medicines are thoroughly tested to ensure they meet rigorous standards so that doctors and patients are assured of their efficacy, quality and safety. In Northern Ireland licensing decisions are devolved and any applications would be considered by the Department of Health Northern Ireland. In the case of import or export licensing, the Home Office discharges this function for Northern Ireland and is the appropriate issuing authority for the UK. Whilst we recognise that people with debilitating illnesses are looking to alleviate their symptoms, it is important that medicines are thoroughly tested to ensure they meet rigorous standards so that doctors and patients are assured of their efficacy, quality and safety. Cannabis is listed as a Schedule 1 drug as in its raw form it is not recognised in the UK as having any medicinal benefit and is therefore subject to strict control restrictions. It is unlawful to import, possess, supply or produce products containing, or consisting of, cannabis except under licence.Context: One year on from the Grenfell Towerblock tragedy, sixty people, many of them elderly and vulnerable, have been told they must leave their homes in Block B, Russell Court, on Belfast’s Lisburn Road. The tower block is owned by Radius Housing who took the decision to close it after a group of experts reported a significant shortfall in fire safety measures at the building. All of the residents will be moved out within four weeks. In the meantime, marshals are on duty 24 hours per day to ensure that everyone remains safe. The fire alarm system in the building has been enhanced and water services and emergency procedures have been checked. Nothing is more important than ensuring people are safe in their homes.  The safety of residents is absolutely paramount but this will undoubtedly cause huge disruption and concern for residents in Russell Court. Fire safety marshals will be on alert around the clock while residents move out over the next four weeks The NI Department for Communities is working closely with Radius Housing and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive to ensure that affected iniduals are rehoused. My Department will continue to keep close contact with officials from the Northern Ireland Civil Service on how residents are being rehoused and supported through this process.DUP ‘fines politicians for media interviews’Context: The DUP has declined to comment on claims it fines its politicians if they talk to the media without permission. A DUP insider told the BBC’s Nolan Show politicians are forced to pay as much as £1,000 if they break internal protocol on dealing with the press. The DUP said it operated under a constitution and a code of conduct, passed by its executive. The BBC has seen a letter signed by the DUP’s chief executive imposing a fine on an elected representative. While the politician was asked to pay a £100 fine, the BBC understands repeat offenders might face higher charges of £500 or £1,000. The other main Stormont parties all told the BBC they do not impose similar penalties. This is unlikely to be something that you will wish to comment on beyond noting that it is a matter for the DUP.Restoration of an Executive The Government’s top priority remains the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland.  My focus remains on redoubling efforts to restore a locally elected, democratically accountable devolved government in Northern Ireland. Engaging closely with the political parties, and the Irish Government as appropriate, to encourage and support work towards an accommodation to restore the Executive. The UK Government also has a responsibility to ensure good governance and the continued delivery of public services. That’s why, with great reluctance, we intervened to set budget allocations for NI departments for 2018-19. I continue to keep available a range of options for supporting the process and encouraging the parties to achieve the positive outcome we all deeply want. I continue to keep under review my statutory obligation to call an Assembly Election.  We will take those decisions which are necessary to provide good governance and political stability for Northern Ireland - consistent always with restoring the Executive and local decision-making at the earliest possible opportunity. We will continue to implement our obligations under the Agreement and its successors where possible - always working for the good of the community as a whole. We will continue to work with all the Northern Ireland parties - and with the Irish Government as appropriate - to remove the barriers to restoring the Executive and a fully functioning Assembly. As we have made repeatedly clear, we continue to believe that a majority in Northern Ireland are committed to the Union, and therefore the tests for a border poll have not been met. On this basis, UKG has no plans to hold a border poll. As the Taoiseach himself acknowledged, continued discussion about a border poll at this time is unhelpful and unnecessary. Considering the importance of this judgment and the questions of law involved, I understand and welcome the NICS decision to appeal. It will be valuable to have these issues fully tested by the Courts so that there is clarity about the implications of the judgment. As these legal proceedings are ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time. I recognise, however, that in the ongoing absence of locally appointed Ministers from the elected NI political parties, the civil servants in Northern Ireland have been left with the responsibility of ensuring governance in Northern Ireland. Since January last year, the NI Civil Service has continued to manage and maintain the delivery of vital public services in Northern Ireland in very difficult circumstances. The NICS and are to be commended for the work they have and continue to do in the public interest. But, I remain firm in my view that it is absolutely crucial that we secure the return of a functioning, effective, devolved government in Northern Ireland, to get back to the business of governing and to take the strategic decisions that affect the long-term future of Northern Ireland and its people. We welcome the progress we made at March European Council, including progress on the Withdrawal Agreement and agreeing the Implementation Period. We want to get onto the future relationship as quickly as possible - both on the economic and the security partnership. We recognise the need to address the remaining areas on the withdrawal. On Northern Ireland  Ireland, we need to come up with a solution which works for communities on both sides, recognising the unique social, political and economic circumstances of the border. We are clear in our objectives of protecting the Belfast Agreement, avoiding a hard border (with no physical infrastructure or related checks and controls) and protecting the economic and constitutional integrity of the UK. We have been undertaking an intensive work programme with the Commission and Irish on solutions since the March Council. We have engaged in a detailed process and schedule of meetings that look at the issues and solutions covering the areas in their draft protocol (with solutions going no further than the PM’s Mansion House speech). This covers a range of issues from customs and SPS through to citizenship rights under the Belfast Agreement. As the PM set out in her letter to Donald Tusk, we are committed to translating plan C into legal text in the Withdrawal Agreement. In our view, we need to address the border through discussions on our future trading relationship with the EU - that’s why we’re keen to get on with discussing the future. The UK is seeking the broadest and deepest possible agreement that covers more sectors and co-operates more fully than any other Free Trade Agreement. We want an economic partnership that delivers the maximum benefits for our economies while respecting the integrity of each other’s institutions. We start from a unique position - on day one we will have exactly the same rules and regulations. A new trading agreement should reflect this starting point. The UK has been clear that we are committed to turning all of the commitments made under the Joint Report into legally binding text. There are some aspects of the Commission’s proposals which we agree with, particularly the preservation of the Common Travel Area. However, the PM has made our position on the other elements of the draft text clear, and said that we could never accept this. That remains our position, and that is why those parts are marked as not agreed in the Withdrawal treaty text. While the UK believes that these commitments can be fulfilled through the overall UK-EU future partnership, it is also necessary to ensure there is a backstop solution for the Northern Ireland border that both avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and protects the constitutional integrity of the UK internal market. We have agreed that, at least, the so called ‘backstop’ option should be translated in legally binding form in to the Withdrawal Agreement. The UK’s proposal on the customs elements of a temporary backstop is that a Temporary Customs Arrangement should exist between the UK and the EU. This will ensure that if a customs arrangement with the EU is not in place by the end of the Implementation Period there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, or between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. We are clear this would only be used in very specific circumstances and that it will be strictly time-limited. It is not our preferred option. The Prime Minister set out, on 7 June, that we are committed to making sure that the future arrangements are in place by the end of December 2021 at the very latest. She also set out that we will not sign up for anything which means the EU can hold the UK in this temporary backstop against its will. At the point that the new customs arrangement is ready the backstop will end. We look forward to discussing this further with the EU.Abortion in Northern IrelandContext: On 12 June 2018, Amnesty International criticised Karen Bradley’s claim that parliament was not qualified to change Northern Ireland’s abortion regime and her further contention that people in Northern Ireland did not want Westminster to take responsibility for the issue. The Government is facing mounting pressure to reform the strict abortion laws in Northern Ireland after Supreme Court judges expressed the view that the law is incompatible with human rights legislation insofar as it prohibits abortion on the grounds of fatal fetal abnormality rape and incest (though no formal declaration of incompatibility was made by the Court, given the standing issues of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission) The Government believes this is a matter for the people of Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland politicians. Abortion is an extremely sensitive issue, and we recognise the strongly held views on all sides of the debate in Northern Ireland. The Government thinks it is absolutely essential that a devolved government in Northern Ireland is restored, so that locally elected, democratically accountable politicians can debate fundamental changes to policy on abortion, and the people of Northern Ireland have a direct say in the process. Our key priority is to redouble our efforts to restore power-sharing, so that the people of Northern Ireland can decide what is right for Northern Ireland, rather than Westminster speaking on their behalf. .If asked about the Supreme Court judgment The Government is carefully considering the full judgment. This is clearly a complex area of law, and an extremely sensitive subject matter, which raises a number of different issues to consider.Does the abortion referendum result in Ireland not change things? The referendum in Ireland has not changed the UK Government’s successive approach to how abortion is dealt with in Northern Ireland. It is important to be clear. The referendum was not a vote on how the law should be reformed. In Ireland, a change of constitution requires a referendum before introducing new legislation. The Irish Government and Dail will now debate and pass the legislation to put in place in Ireland.What will the UK Government do to recognise the fact that Northern Ireland will soon have the most restrictive abortion law of any part of the British Isles? We are committed to restoring locally elected, democratically accountable devolved government in Northern Ireland, so that fundamental changes can be made in Northern Ireland. And action has already been taken in this area. We have put in place arrangements that mean women from Northern Ireland will not be charged for termination of pregnancy services in England, with travel support available for those women who find themselves in a financial hardship situation. We believe this approach strikes an appropriate balance between the devolved position of abortion in Northern Ireland, and allowing women normally resident in Northern Ireland to have access to abortion services in England within the bounds of the law.If the Irish Government extends provision of abortion services to women normally resident in Northern Ireland, won’t this increase pressure for Northern Ireland to update its abortion law? It would not be appropriate to speculate on what approach may or may not be adopted following the referendum. That is a matter for the Irish Government and the Irish Parliament.  The UK Government has already put in place arrangements to allow women normally resident in Northern Ireland to have access to safe abortion services in England within the bounds of the law. Since the 29th June last year no Northern Irish women have been charged for abortion procedures performed in England. But this decision does not change the fact that abortion is a devolved issue, and therefore rightly one for the Northern Ireland Assembly to debate.If asked whether the Government agrees that abortion is a human rights issue: The UK has a longstanding tradition of ensuring our rights and liberties are protected domestically and of fulfilling our international human rights obligations. Rights are protected domestically through the Human Rights Act 1998 – and through the devolution statutes, as well as other key pieces of legislation and the common law. Abortion raises complex human rights issues, as has been recognised by the courts when considering these matters. The Government is carefully considering the recent Supreme Court full judgment.If asked why the Government will not just repeal sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 to legalise abortion in NI We have no plans to amend the law on abortion in either England and Wales or Northern Ireland. This is a devolved matter in Northern Ireland, and ultimately this is an issue for a restored Assembly to consider, where the decision can be taken by locally elected, locally accountable politicians.Is the Government against extending abortion rights to Northern Ireland? We are very clear that abortion is a devolved issue and the Assembly is the proper place for such legislation for Northern Ireland to be considered. The Government therefore has no plans to introduce legislation changing Northern Ireland’s abortion law. We are committed to restoring locally elected, democratically accountable devolved government in Northern Ireland.But that does not prevent others from introducing such legislation if they so wish. In such circumstances, it is worth reiterating two important considerations: One, the power of Westminster, as the sovereign Parliament, to legislate remains and Two, the Government’s policy is to allow a free vote on matters of conscience such as abortion. Building on the good progress made on proposals to address the legacy of the past, this Government believes that now is the time to seek wider views. That is why on 11 May, the Secretary of State launched a consultation to provide everyone who has an interest, with the opportunity to see the proposed way forward and contribute to the discussion on the issues.  This is an open consultation and we want everyone to have their say on how the new legacy institutions would work in practice. There is broad agreement amongst victims and survivors that the legacy institutions as they are currently set up are not working well for anyone. As our Northern Ireland manifesto at the last Election made clear the Government remains committed to the implementation of the legacy institutions in the 2014 Stormont House Agreement. We believe that the legacy institutions have the potential to provide better outcomes for victims and survivors and for all those affected by the Troubles. The new institutions will be under legal obligations to operate in ways that are fair, balanced and proportionate. The HIU will deal with deaths in chronological order and ensure that unresolved deaths - including hundreds of murders caused by terrorists - are investigated. A number of terrorist murders from the Troubles are actively under investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other police forces. I am clear that under current mechanisms for investigating the past there is a disproportionate focus on former members of the armed forces and the Police. The Government is committed to ensuring that all outstanding deaths in Northern Ireland should be investigated in ways that are fair, balanced and proportionate The point the Prime Minister was making was that we want to see all outstanding deaths in Northern Ireland investigated in a fair, balanced and proportionate way to ensure the system does not focus disproportionately on the security forces. We want the HIU set up to look at all outstanding cases, and to investigate in chronological order, so that there is no unfair focus.Statute of Limitations Our Northern Ireland manifesto made clear, any approach to the past must be consistent with the rule of law. Any amnesty or statute of limitations would need to apply to all those involved in Troubles-related incidents, including former terrorists, if the UK is to comply with international law. To imply otherwise would be to mislead veterans. A statute of limitations does not remove the need to have Article 2 compliant investigation where iniduals have been killed as a result of the use of force by the state. We must remember that in Northern Ireland, our soldiers put their lives on the line to uphold the rule of law. Many people in Northern Ireland still cling to the hope that the law will see justice done for the many terrible crimes that took place during the Troubles. For that reason, we need to be aware that within Northern Ireland there is widespread opposition to any form of statute of limitations - from victims and survivors from all parts of the community from political parties from many veterans who live in Northern Ireland and from former and serving police officers. It is better to have the HIU, a carefully designed Article 2 compliant mechanism which would only re-investigate in specific circumstances set out in the legislation. The HIU will have a duty to act in a manner which is fair, balanced and proportionate. The current mechanisms for investigating the past are not delivering for victims. Right now too many cases are not being investigated, including hundreds of murders by terrorists. Implementing the consultation proposals will create the Historical Investigations Unit (HIU) which will be under a statutory duty to aim to complete its work within 5 years and to deal with deaths in chronological order. The HIU will be under a legal duty to be fair, balanced and proportionate, to ensure that our veterans are not unfairly treated or disproportionately investigated. The HIU cannot unnecessarily duplicate any investigation or part of it. It will look at more deaths of security forces than deaths by security forces.Support for veterans Where veterans face allegations in connection with events arising from their duties, they receive full legal support and representation (including the services of a barrister, where this is appropriate) for as long as is necessary. This applies regardless of how long the veteran served, the duration of any proceedings, or how long ago the events occurred. In addition to legal support, a range of welfare and pastoral support is available, depending on the needs of the inidual veteran. Sometimes this is delivered through the MOD’s ‘Veterans UK’, and the Regimental Association or equivalent organisation can also be involved, as can appropriate charities, depending on circumstances. Inquest reform is essential if the inquest system is to work effectively. The Government continues to support reform of the legacy inquest system. However, this is a devolved matter and it will be for the devolved administration to make a decision on inquest funding. I have been deeply moved listening to the victims and survivors I have met in recent months, including those living with severe injuries as a result of the Troubles. Work on a pension is properly for the Executive to take forward. It is one of the many reasons why it is so important to have an Executive restored. However, the Government is aware of how deeply upsetting and frustrating this delay is for those who suffered so much during the Troubles.  That is why I have commissioned advice from the Victims Commissioner in Northern Ireland on a victims’ pension. This is an important issue for the UK Government and we want to ensure that progress is made. The Government believes that once updated advice is received, consideration must be given to agrees how a pension could be brought forward in a way that has the support of, and meets the needs of, victims and survivors in Northern Ireland. In the continued absence of an Executive, I set out a NI Budget for the 2018-19 financial year in a Statement to Parliament on 8 March. I am planning now to take forward a Budget Bill to put this budget position on a legal footing, providing certainty on finances, in order to protect delivery of public services and ensure good governance. The Government is committed to a comprehensive and ambitious set of city deals across Northern Ireland to boost investment and help unlock Northern Ireland’s full potential. I understand that the Belfast City Regions has now presented its initial proposals to officials from the NICS and UK Government, and that work is ongoing to refine projects and develop the appropriate business cases.  I welcome this progress, and officials from UKG will continue to support the development of a set of city deal. There remains more work to be done, but it is important that progress continues. I understand your calls for a review of local government services, however, you will understand that this is a devolved matter and not one for the UK Government. This is one of many areas which show just how important it is to have a restored Executive back in place and making the strategic decisions required in the interests of the whole community. And that is why restoring devolution remains our overriding priority."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3534096.1529268751!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"northern secretary s briefing notes sent to media in blunder","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Northern Secretary Karen Bradley arrives for a Cabinet meeting chaired by British prime minister Theresa May at No 10 Downing Street earlier this month in London. File photograph: Jack TaylorGetty ImagesThe Northern Ireland Office has issued a press notice to journalists which included the Secretary of State’s briefing notes on a range of key issues including Brexit and abortion, and legacy and economic issues.The document, sent to outlets on Sunday night about a media opportunity with Karen Bradley on Monday, outlined the British government’s position on a number of key issues impacting on the North.On abortion, the document said: “Our key priority is to redouble our efforts to restore power-sharing, so that the people of Northern Ireland can decide what is right for Northern Ireland, rather than Westminster speaking on their behalf.”On what the government intended to do to recognise the fact that Northern Ireland will soon have the most restrictive abortion law in the UK or Ireland, it noted a commitment to restoring Stormont and that it provided the option for women to travel to England for a free abortion.“We believe this approach strikes an appropriate balance between the devolved position of abortion in Northern Ireland, and allowing women normally resident in Northern Ireland to have access to abortion services in England within the bounds of the law.”On Brexit, the notes said the British government wanted to get to the future relationship with the EU as quickly as possible – in terms of both the economic and security partnership.“In our view, we need to address the border through discussions on our future trading relationship with the EU – that’s why we’re keen to get on with discussing the future.”On the UK’s future economic partnership with the EU, it is seeking “the broadest and deepest possible agreement that covers more sectors and co-operates more fully than any other Free Trade Agreement”.The  asked the NIO to comment on the inclusion of Ms Bradley’s briefing notes in the document.An email sent to media afterwards said: “Please disregard previous email which was sent in error – the contents of which should not be used.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3533998.1529261112!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ryanair wants morning airport alcohol ban after flight diverted","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA group of drunken Irish-based holidaymakers forced an Ibiza-bound Ryanair flight from Dublin to ert to Paris on Saturday morning.

A group of up to 20 holidaymakers were involved in the unruly drink-fuelled disturbance, and three passengers were removed and detained by French police on arrival at Paris Beauvais on Saturday morning.The captain of the return flight from the party island to Dublin on Saturday afternoon – delayed by 2hrs 40m as a result of the disturbance – apologised for the delay and explained the outward flight had had to ert due to the disturbance.The captain said there had been children onboard the earlier flight, which was erted over safety concerns for all the passengers.The captain said the unruly passengers had been drinking at Dublin Airport prior to take-off.The Ibiza-bound flight’s scheduled take-off had been 8.50am on Saturday. Speaking of the episode, Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said: “This flight from Dublin to Ibiza erted to Paris Beauvais after three passengers became disruptive inflight.“The aircraft landed normally and the passengers were removed and detained by police upon arrival, before the aircraft continued to Ibiza.”Mr Kiely said: “We will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time and the safety and comfort of our customers, crew and aircraft is our number one priority.”Mr Kiely was not able to comment on the costs to Ryanair of the ersion or the legal fate of the three passengers who were taken off the plane.He said: “This is now a matter for local police.”He said the incident “is exactly why we are calling for significant changes to prohibit the sale of alcohol at airports, such as a two-drink limit per passenger and no alcohol sales before 10am”. He said: “It’s incumbent on the airports to introduce these preventative measures to curb excessive drinking and the problems it creates, rather than allowing passengers to drink to excess before their flights.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3534090.1529268402!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new rules to tackle ireland s reputation as puppy farm capital of europe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe puppy farms “are a profit-making operation churning out puppies all the time”. Photograph: Getty ImagesNew dog-breeding guidelines to combat Ireland’s reputation as the puppy farm capital of Europe will be published by the by end of June.Minister of State for Rural Affairs Sean Kyne has said he wanted to see “the highest standards achieved by dog-breeding establishments in Ireland”.The Minister said he would meet the commitment he made to publish the guidelines by the end of June following a detailed consultation process, which he described as “robust” and which included a large number of submissions.Mr Kyne said there had already been improvements, including a drop in the number of dogs being put down every year.He said 996 dogs were euthanised in local authority pounds last year compared to 1,600 in 2016. That was part of a continuing decline, from a high in 2002 of more than 21,000.The issue was raised in the Dáil last week when Independent TD Maureen O’Sullivan said she had checked a website and discovered it had “2,000 ads selling puppies and that does not take into account the number of puppies available on each of those ads”.The puppy farms “are a profit-making operation, churning out puppies all the time”, the Dublin Central TD said.“We know the appalling conditions on some of the farms,” she said, and warned that the guidelines should include a provision that inspections of such dog-breeding establishments should be unannounced. “The problem with inspections is that they are by appointment, and the dog breeders know when the inspector is coming”.She also criticised the level of enforcement as not strong enough because if a fault was found the only penalty was a notice to improve. Ms O’Sullivan, who with Independents4Change TD Clare Daly has repeatedly raised animal welfare issues in the Dáil, said three Government departments – Agriculture, Rural and Community Affairs and Culture – had responsibility for the issue, “and when it falls between the cracks like that, abuses take place”.She also said the issue of whether puppy farms should be allowed to operate at all had to be considered. “Puppies are not livestock and are not bred for slaughter or food production. I hope the guidelines will be more robust and have severe enforcement aspects.”Mr Kyne said some of the submissions took the view that it should be entirely within the Department of Agriculture, where vets had a role. Local authorities, however, have ultimate responsibility for enforcement, and he had had discussions with local authorities and animal charities.He agreed with Ms O’Sullivan’s concerns about the advertising of dogs for sale on websites, but said she should take revenue issues up with the Minister for Finance.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"magnum freedom project pictures","story":"1968 was a seismic year of deep societal and political shifts.

Money Expert, said: Clearly the way we shop and pay for services is changing but for millions of people in the UK cash still plays an essential role in their everyday lives. With bank branch closures on the rise and the UK\u0027s free-to-use ATM network under threat, it\u0027s vital these people are still able to access the cash they need.Banks and FinanceTransport for London (TfL)Please review our commenting policyThomas Markle reveals he cried as he watched Duchess of Sussex marry Prince Harry from rented hide-outAnt McPartlin \u0026#39finds love\u0026#39 with personal assistant as wife tweets of heartbreak Three dead as strong earthquake shakes Japanese city of OsakaMelania Trump and Laura Bush wade into debate over children separated from families at US-Mexico borderThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendComment: Marks \u0026amp Spencer has rare flashes of brilliance, but that\u0026#39s no way to run a thriving businessColombian election: Ivan Duque vows to \u0026#39correct\u0026#39 peace accord after comfortable winChildren separated from parents at US border held in cages in Texas warehouseMillennials on track to have worse health problems than their parents by middle age, new study findsWorld Cup 2018: \u0026#39Safe space\u0026#39 for LGBT football fans in Russia forced to move after \u0026#39political attack\u0026#39Shoppers offered cash for old unwanted John Lewis clothes even if they are damaged\u0026#39Windrush Day\u0026#39 will celebrate the arrival of Caribbean migrants 70 years ago Donald Trump UK visit: Everything you need to know, from when he will arrive to who he is expected to meetStealth tax to pay for NHS boost, with personal tax thresholds expected to be frozen after 2020Comment: NHS funding boost comes dangerously close to being a magic money treeDavid Dimbleby to leave Question Time after 25 yearsPoldark, series 4 episode 2 review -

her predecessor at the Home Office - came under fire for her hostile environment policy towards migrants.Sajid Javid, who replaced Ms Rudd, signalled a softening of immigration policy under his leadership and that the much-criticised policy would be reviewed.Last week, Mr Javid admitted that as many as 63 Windrush generation migrants may have been wrongly deported by the Government.

We will be the government that like never before in our country will confront this cancer.”Mr Duque also vowed to convert Colombia into “the country of social justice and political equality.”Followers of presidential candidate Duque celebrate his victory in the second round of the presidential election in BogotaThe new president will inherit a country still scarred by five decades of bloody armed conflict and grappling with soaring cocaine production. Former guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are struggling to reinsert themselves in civilian life in a nation where many people remain hesitant to forgive. It was the first presidential election since the signing of the 2016 peace agreement ending Latin America\u0027s longest-running conflict and was ultimately just as much about the isive accord as it was deeply entrenched issues like persistent corruption.Colombia\u0027s peace process to end a conflict that left more than 250,000 people dead is considered largely irreversible. Most of the more than 7,000 rebels who have surrendered their weapons have started new lives as farmers, community leaders and journalists. Last year the rebels launched a new political party and will soon occupy 10 seats in congress.But the accord remains contentious and Mr Duque pledged throughout his campaign to make changes that would deliver peace with justice.That peace we long for - that demands corrections - will have corrections, so that the victims are the centre of the process, to guarantee truth, justice and reparation, Mr Duque said.Through constitutional reform or by decree, he could proceed with proposals such as not allowing ex-combatants behind grave human rights abuses to take political office until they have confessed their war crimes and compensated victims.The current agreement allows most rebels to avoid jail, a sore point for many.“I am a victim of the FARC, I suffered violence in Antioquia,” Andres Felipe Londono, an economist, told The . “Law and order is the most important.”Responding to concerns Mr Duque would jeopardise the peace process, Mr Londono said the president-elect would just make “modifications”.He added: “Old FARC commanders are today enjoying impunity and will pay for their crimes. In the peace process, victims were not represented. It’s very important to go over the accords.”  FARC called on Mr Duque to show good sense over his threat to rewrite the 2016 peace agreement.It is necessary for good sense to be imposed. What the country demands is an integral peace, which will lead us to the hoped-for reconciliation, the FARC said in a statement after Duque\u0027s win.Mr Duque, who has just four years experience as a senator, will be one of the country’s youngest ever presidents. But this was of little concern to his supporters.“For young people, their age is always something that will be held against them, but doing a job is how you learn,” said Edna Meldrano, a 32-year-old numerical analyst from Bogota. “He has the backing of a lot of people with experience.”President Elect Ivan Duque shakes hands with supporters after his victory in the presidential runoff election in BogotaCelebrating with Mr Duque was a hall of fans adorned in orange and blue, the colours which have become associated with his campaign.Through the evening, they enjoyed a party atmosphere, taking selfies and chanting, while dancing to the traditional sounds of Vallenato and Champeta, music from Colombia’s coast.Some had travelled from across the country to see Mr Duque in his moment of victory.Lourdes Menezes, 50, and Eddy Cruz, 51, travelled 300 miles from Cucuta, in the department of Norte de Santander. The town is at the epicentre of the ongoing Venezuelan migration crisis, which is likely to be one of Duque’s biggest foreign policy headaches.Presidential candidate Petro addresses supporters after being defeated by Duque in Colombia\u0026#39s presidential election in BogotaFor Mr Petro,  the outcome was bitter sweet. Mr Petro won a majority in only eight of 32 provinces, and the capital Bogota. But the fact that a leftist advanced to the presidential runoff is historic in Colombia, where traditionally conservative politicians have held sway.  He had energised young voters and drew millions to public plazas with his fiery speeches vowing to improve the lives of poor, disenfranchised Colombians.And though he failed to catch Mr Duque, his more than 8 million votes marked the biggest ballot box success for a leftist presidential contender in a country where leftist politicos have long been stigmatised over fears of potential ties to guerrilla causes.Perhaps as time passes people will be less scared about voting for left-wing politicians, said Jorge Gallego, a professor at Colombia\u0027s Rosario University. Although with this result, it\u0027s proven that Colombia is still a right-wing country.Please review our commenting policyThomas Markle reveals he cried as he watched Duchess of Sussex marry Prince Harry from rented hide-outAnt McPartlin \u0026#39finds love\u0026#39 with personal assistant as wife tweets of heartbreak Three dead as strong earthquake shakes Japanese city of OsakaMelania Trump and Laura Bush wade into debate over children separated from families at US-Mexico borderThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendComment: Marks \u0026amp Spencer has rare flashes of brilliance, but that\u0026#39s no way to run a thriving businessChildren separated from parents at US border held in cages in Texas warehouseMillennials on track to have worse health problems than their parents by middle age, new study findsWorld Cup 2018: \u0026#39Safe space\u0026#39 for LGBT football fans in Russia forced to move after \u0026#39political attack\u0026#39Cash is no longer king as pensioners buy into contactless revolutionShoppers offered cash for old unwanted John Lewis clothes even if they are damaged\u0026#39Windrush Day\u0026#39 will celebrate the arrival of Caribbean migrants 70 years ago Donald Trump UK visit: Everything you need to know, from when he will arrive to who he is expected to meetStealth tax to pay for NHS boost, with personal tax thresholds expected to be frozen after 2020Comment: NHS funding boost comes dangerously close to being a magic money treeDavid Dimbleby to leave Question Time after 25 yearsPoldark, series 4 episode 2 review - Ross and George\u0026#39s metaphorical battle for supremacy continues to win us overGrenfell survivors question why it took 15 minutes for firefighters to tackle initial blazeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"thomas markle describes moment prince harry asked permission","story":"digitalservices@telegraphDuchess of SussexDuke of SussexThomas Markle has told how he cried as he watched his daughter’s wedding on television in a small rented hide-out, in a tell-all interview in which he claims Prince Harry was open to Brexit.Mr Markle, who said he was “jealous” as the Prince of Wales walked his daughter down the aisle as he was receiving treatment for a heart attack, has spoken to Good Morning Britain in an extraordinary interview detailing private political conversations.Claiming Prince Harry had once told him to “give Donald Trump a chance”, the 73-year-old alleged the sixth-in-line to the throne had seemed “open” to the idea of Brexit.Mr Markle told how his daughter, then actress Meghan Markle, had confided in him that she had a new boyfriend, before eventually revealing he was British, then that he was a Prince they should call him “H” for security reasons.He spoke to the Prince straight afterwards, he said, getting to know him over the telephone before giving his blessing to their marriage following their engagement in November.“Meghan told me first and then a few times after that Harry got on the phone with her and asked for her hand over the phone,” he said.“I said you’re a gentleman, promise me you’ll never raise a hand against my daughter and of course I give you my permission.”Thomas Markle with his daughter Meghan, whom he \u0026#39absolutely wanted to walk\u0026#39 down the aisleSaying his new son-in-law was “great” and an “interesting guy”, Mr Markle said he “made a great pick” in his daughter, who has been a “princess since the day she was born”.Revealing that he watched the ceremony from a television in a room rented for him by friends in California, Mr Markle said he had been “jealous” that he was left as a “footnote in history”, but said “thank God” that the Prince of Wales, whom he has never spoken to, was there to step in.In an interview unlikely to have been sanctioned by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex or Kensington Palace, Mr Markle said he had come to know the “smart” Prince Harry over the phone in a series of “interesting conversations” in which they allegedly discussed his private political views.“I was complaining I didn’t like Donald Trump,” said Mr Markle. “He said give Donald Trump a chance. I sort of disagreed with that but I still like Harry. That was his politics, I have my politics.”Thomas Markle gives his first interview on Good Morning BritainAsked whether he believed the newlywed Duke was still a fan, he added: “I would hope not now, but at the time he might have been.”On the subject of Brexit, he said: “It was just a loose conversation about something we have to try. There was no real commitment for it. I think he was open to the experiment.”Mr Markle said that he expects his daughter will want to try for children soon.Asked whether a “stork” had paid a visit to the palace yet, Mr Markle said: “She’s wanted children for a long time.“When she met Harry and she spoke about how much she loves him... there’s got to be a child in the making there soon.”Saying he had “absolutely” wanted to walk his daughter down the aisle, he disclosed he had spoken with Prince Harry, Ms Markle and one of their security staff about his trip to the UK shortly before being admitted to hospital with heart problems for a second time.After learning how severe they were, he said, he had to tell his daughter he would not make her wedding, leaving her concerned and in tears.Talking about the moment he told his daughter and her husband-to-be that he would not make the wedding, Mr Markle said: They were disappointed. Meghan cried, I\u0027m sure, and they both said \u0027Take care of yourself, we are really worried about you\u0027.He added: I absolutely wanted to walk my daughter down the aisle.The retired TV lighting director disclosed he had cried as he watched the royal ceremony on television, describing his daughter as beautiful.It was incredible watching her, he said. I was very proud. I was very upset that it wasn\u0027t me (walking her down the aisle) but the whole world was watching my daughter. I was very happy about that.The unfortunate thing for me now is I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history rather than the dad walking her down the aisle. That upsets me somewhat.Royal wedding day pictures: Best photos from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#039s ceremony and receptionSaying he had prepared a speech for the big day, Mr Markle told GMB he had hoped to regale wedding guests with the story of how he had told her about this nice British guy before thanking the Royal family for welcoming her.I couldn\u0027t be more proud of those two, I think they\u0027ll do a fabulous job, he said. They\u0027re great and I love then dearly. I\u0027m very happy to have a new son-in-law.Asked about his own actions before the wedding, which included a series of photography shoots set up with the paparazzi, Mr Markle said I accept full responsibility. I can say I\u0027m sorry for those things for the rest of my life, but I\u0027m paying for those things for the rest of my life.But as long as they\u0027re happy and have a great life and have some beautiful children and do good things in the world, I\u0027m can\u0027t ask for more.Asked about the much-publicised episode, which saw him exposed for colluding with the paparazzi days before the royal wedding, Mr Markle said he had not done it for the money but to improve his image.“Obviously that all went to hell,” he said. “I feel bad about it, I apologise for it and that’s all I can do. That was a mistake.”Mr Markle said dozens of members of his daughter\u0027s family had come out of the woodwork demanding wedding invitations, saying he thought it very smart of her not to have them in Windsor.Saying he had spoken to the happy couple the day after their wedding, telling his daughter it was fabulous, she looked beautiful.As they discussed visiting him in Mexico, Mr Markle claimed he told the newlyweds it was a bad idea, due to the Press around his house, and that I wished they would go on a honeymoon.Thomas Markle Snr and his daughter Meghan Markle, in picturesSaying he had not yet met the Duke or his family in person, he said: I look forward to coming to London and seeing them soon, I would love to.Adding that he knows the couple are  very busy, he spoke of his admiration for the Queen he described as one of the most incredible women in the world.Mr Markle said he hopes he has not offended his daughter and Prince Harry by appearing on GMB for the interview.He said: I hope I haven\u0027t offended them, I don\u0027t think I have, they know I love them and I hope the royals - the Royal family - will understand my feelings as well.He also told the programme about how he mixed up a set of white dolls and black dolls when Meghan was a child because that was normal to me and that\u0027s the way I wanted my daughter to feel.Mr Markle said that he opted to take part in the interview because he wanted people to know he is a normal guy and because he wants to have a good relationship with Meghan and Harry.He said: Over the last few weeks, everybody has had different opinions, some people said I was faking my heart attack, some people said I was skipping out, all kinds of stories were coming out about me, negative ones.But I just want people to know I\u0027m a normal guy, I\u0027m a retired man and I was living a quiet little life and this happened, and lots of things happened around it, and I\u0027ve tried to survive through that, but more than anything I don\u0027t want my daughter or new son-in-law to be hurt by any of this. I want to have a nice, normal relationship with my royal family as well now.Duchess of SussexDuke of SussexPlease review our commenting policyAnt McPartlin \u0026#39finds love\u0026#39 with personal assistant as wife tweets of heartbreak Three dead as strong earthquake shakes Japanese city of OsakaMelania Trump and Laura Bush wade into debate over children separated from families at US-Mexico borderComment: Marks \u0026amp Spencer has rare flashes of brilliance, but that\u0026#39s no way to run a thriving businessThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendColombian election: Ivan Duque vows to \u0026#39correct\u0026#39 peace accord after comfortable winChildren separated from parents at US border held in cages in Texas warehouseMillennials on track to have worse health problems than their parents by middle age, new study findsWorld Cup 2018: \u0026#39Safe space\u0026#39 for LGBT football fans in Russia forced to move after \u0026#39political attack\u0026#39Cash is no longer king as pensioners buy into contactless revolutionShoppers offered cash for old unwanted John Lewis clothes even if they are damaged\u0026#39Windrush Day\u0026#39 will celebrate the arrival of Caribbean migrants 70 years ago Donald Trump UK visit: Everything you need to know, from when he will arrive to who he is expected to meetStealth tax to pay for NHS boost, with personal tax thresholds expected to be frozen after 2020Comment: NHS funding boost comes dangerously close to being a magic money treeDavid Dimbleby to leave Question Time after 25 yearsPoldark, series 4 episode 2 review - Ross and George\u0026#39s metaphorical battle for supremacy continues to win us overGrenfell survivors question why it took 15 minutes for firefighters to tackle initial blazeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/12/15/the-meg-0.jpg?width=900\u0026amp;height=340\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6313726  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= The Meg  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/12/15/the-meg-0.jpg","title":"incredibles 2 box office record release date uk trailer disney animation","story":"Created with Sketch.The animated sequel has already earned a global total of $231.5 million\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent CultureIncredibles 2 shatters records with $180m box office openingThe superpowered sequel opened to a whopping $180 million, making it the biggest debut of all time for an animated film.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Dedan\u0026nbspinscriptions. Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.Iranians are angry with Israel and Saudi Arabia, not just TrumpSaudi Arabia to build giant $9bn oil complex with French company TotalSaudis \u0027to cut off Qatar\u0027 with canal, nuclear dump and military baseSaudi Arabian Prince toured Hollywood and Harvard on trip to USAnd a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Perhaps people are fed up with being distracted. Perhaps they’re fed up with being tarred with the same brush as all those proper racist, right-wing fanatics who’ve coopted the British flag for their own endsClick to followThe Independent OnlineSome homes do beg the question: patriotism or jingoism?If you’re of a flag-waving bent, you’ll be enjoying an almost unparalleled summer right now. From the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, through the Queen’s official birthday, to the World Cup, which segues nicely into the annual patriorgasm of The Proms, 2018 is the year for you.But… where are you? As the globe’s finest football tournament gets underway in Russia, there is a definite dearth of flags draped from bedroom windows, flying from car roofs, clattering against poles erected in gardens. Whither John Bull, Britannia, and Captain Britain?We in Britain have a curious relationship with the Union Jack, and in England an even more uneasy affair with the cross of St George. We often opine that other countries have a far more relaxed approach to waving their national flag, and wonder why we can’t be the same here.It’s a vexing question, or perhaps more a question of vexillology (the study of flags, don’t you know). But the simple answer is that being overly fond of the English or British flags these days marks you out as a certain type of person.You fly the flag, you’re a close-our-borders, take-back-control, I’m-not-racist-but Brexiteer who brushes away a tear at the first strains of the national anthem. You fly the flag and you’re a gammon-faced Middle Englander one heart-pump away from a coronary as you spit bile from the fourth row of the Question Time audience. You fly the flag, you’re a bulldog-tattooed, shaven headed, there’s-no-black-in-the-Union-Jack sports casual yomping around London fuelled by cheap lager and steak bakes, demanding the release of the English Defence League’s jailed founder Tommy Robinson.The Union Jack and the St George cross have been tainted by association with the far right. Nobody seems surprised any more to see some bull-headed idiot draped in the flag and performing a Nazi salute. Which is a quite remarkable state of affairs.We’ll recall, of course, that back when the Nazi salute was even more popular than it was now, the red, white and blue of the Union Flag (it’s often said that the flag should only be called the Union Jack when flown from a royal navy ship, though this is apparently a relatively recent cause for debate) was the symbol under which the free world rallied. This flag kills Nazis, we said, back in the 1940s. Even Dad’s Army in the 1970s had in its opening credits the Union Jack pointedly and relentlessly pushing swastikas back into the depths of Europe.These colours don’t run, people used to say. Back in the Second World War, they didn’t, but that’s not what they meant when they said it. They meant that anyone wearing the English flag on foreign soil, for the purposes of supporting the national football team, would not be backing down from a fight with fans of other nations.English football fans abroad earned such a foul reputation that ahead of the World Cup, England’s head of football policing, Mark Roberts, urged fans to leave the flags at home, warning they could “come across as imperialistic and cause antagonism”.It may not surprise you to learn that there is a Flag Institute in the UK, which describes itself as the country’s national flag charity and which has members “in all six continents” (not quite sure how that works). They have produced a guide entitled Flying Flags in the United Kingdom (which is downloadable free from their site at flaginstitute.org) and they want the British flag to be a symbol of unity not ision.In the guide’s introduction, written by Flag Institute president Malcolm Farrow and co-signed by MP Andrew Rosindell, chair of the Flags and Heraldry committee, it says:\u0026nbsp“For too long our flag has been taken for granted and largely ignored.“Few children are taught about it in school, few people know its history or even the correct way to fly it. It is time that this changed and we became familiar with our flag, because all of us have the right to fly the flag and may use it on land wherever and whenever we wish. It is the people’s flag as well as the state flag.”But… is it, though, really? The origins of flags lie in military roots. Roman troops used to have a standard bearer carrying, say, the eagle of the Ninth Legion to let you know that trouble was on its way.

And by the turn of the 17th century, the forerunner of the Union Jack was created by royal decree so that both English and Scottish ships could fly the same banner and be easily identifiable at sea.Flags have without question proved vital during times of war and strife. Look, here we come to kick your arse. Oh dear, we’re getting our arses kicked, send help. That ship’s not flying our flag, let’s go and kick its arse.Had Britain not planted its flag in large amounts of the world during the days of empire, perhaps the Union Jack might not have the imperialist, unwelcome connotations it has\u0026nbspacross the world. Imagine, if you will, the Second World War having gone in a different direction. Imagine the Nazis had won. Then consider how people would have felt, 20 years later, when the German team came over to Britain for the 1966 World Cup, their fans draped in swastika flags.Flying the British or English flags on home turf is necessarily an act of nationalism. What else can it be? Patriotism? Isn’t that just the same thing? If you fly the Union Jack from a flagpole in your garden, what’s the purpose? To tell your neighbours that you’re English? They probably know that. They live next door. They are, too.However, to voice criticism of flag-flying is to invite a host of problems to your door. Ask Huw Thomas, who was standing in the Welsh ward of Ceredigion for Labour in the 2015 General Election, and who wrote a blog (almost 10\u0026nbspyears earlier) saying the number of England flags he saw flying in Wales “sickened” him and were the signs of a “simpleton or casual racist”.Ask Emily Thornberry, the Labour MP who resigned as shadow attorney general in 2014 after being attacked for posting to social media a picture of a house in Rochester draped with three England flags. Her tweet was deemed to be snobby and disrespectful, especially to the working class that Labour was desperately trying to court back to the fold.And class must raise its head in this debate. Where are you most likely to see flags being flown? On the council estates, in the working-class enclaves. Not so much in Ilkley and Mayfair, perhaps. Save for the almost cartoonish pomp of the Proms, grassroots patriotism is seen as a salt of the earth sort of thing. Why, is another matter. Maybe it’s a classic authoritarian bread and circuses sort of thing as a government, if you can keep the masses distracted with flag-waving fervour, they’re not going to spend as much time worrying that you’re stripping the NHS down to the bone, scrapping all their benefits and mothballing the places where they work.Maybe that’s why there aren’t as many flags flying as normal this summer. Perhaps people are fed up with being distracted. Perhaps they’re fed up with being tarred with the same brush as all those proper racist, right-wing fanatics who’ve coopted the British flag for their own ends.Still, we must remember that there was a brief period in recent history when the Union Jack seemed to shed its negative connotations. It was the 1990s, of course, those middle years of the decade when Britpop held sway, when football was coming home for Euro 96. Three Lions on a Shirt. Spice Girl Geri Halliwell’s Union Jack dress.

Can we ever return to the days of the 1990s when Britain was out, loud and proud?Perhaps this year, with its much-rumoured reunion of The Spice Girls, is when we finally find out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Attacks on humans are supposed to be as rare as winning the lottery and being struck by lightning at the same time. Yet last\u0026nbspyear, a man’s body was extracted from a 23-foot\u0026nbsppython, in an incident captured on\u0026nbspa gruesome YouTube video.When Ms\u0026nbspTiba\u0026nbspfailed to return by Friday morning, her sister went to search\u0026nbspfor her alongside around 100 people from\u0026nbspthe village of\u0026nbspPersiapan\u0026nbspLawela. They\u0026nbspfound only Ms Tiba’s footprints, her flashlight, her machete and slippers.The snake was found a few dozen yards from Ms Tiba’s belongings. It was 23 feet long and so bloated it could barely move, with a large bulge midway down its body.The villagers killed the snake and opened it up to find Ms Tiba intact inside the snake, clothed just as she had been when she went to check the corn.Found in the Middle East, North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, the cobra’s venom can kill a human within 15 minutes and an elephant in three hours. It can be recognised by its small flat head and round snoutFound across Southern Africa, the snake, which has dark stripes, hunts small mammals, birds, lizards, frogs and toadsOnce thought to be the world’s deadliest snake, the black mamba is found in Southern and Eastern Africa. It strikes once, then waits for its prey to become paralysed before devouring itThe snake, which is found in South Asia and India, has a speckled belly and a distinctive cross-shaped white mark on its head. It hunts lizards scorpions and centipedesThe colour varies on this snake, which is found in sub-Saharan Africa. It eats small rodents, lizards and other snakes. Unlike other snakes it projects its venomA reticulated python secures its prey with a bite, then wraps its body around the victim, squeezing down until the victim cannot breathe, before consuming.It’s so rare for humans to be eaten that it’s more common to see hoaxes. A single photo of a snake digesting a pig has been used to falsely claim attacks on humans in China, Africa and across Southeast Asia.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This London-dominated house totally fails to represent huge swathes of the UK.Many peers are former MPs, political staffers or civil servantsWhat\u0027s the purpose of the House of Lords? How do you become a Lord? What are the House of Lords traditions? All these answers explained.1 of 25Regions including the north west and the Midlands are not only under-represented, but those peers who say they live there do not represent each region\u0027s ersity, whether in terms of their politics or otherwise.The Lords is looking increasingly like just another Westminster private members\u0027 club, and it\u0027s not hard to see why when the system is so unbalanced.The analysis also revealed out of 816 peers, 235 are former politicians, 68 worked as political staffers and 13 were civil servants.Mr Hughes said: Adding to the detachment between the House of Lords and UK citizens is the fact that so many peers are former politicians.More than half of peers say they live in London, the east or south east, the ERS saidWhen the PM can stuff a so-called scrutiny chamber with whoever they want, the result is that it fails to reflect the nation.That won\u0027t be solved by bunging in a few more unelected cronies. Instead, a fairly elected chamber of the regions would ensure guaranteed, proportional representation and a strong voice for all parts of the UK.A House of Lords spokesperson said: Members of the House of Lords come from across the UK, but are not representatives of geographical areas.Members are appointed by virtue of their experience and represent nearly every profession including law, nursing, teaching, defence, engineering, music, television, and politics.No other senate in the world has such erse members, or as broad a range of expertise. All members use their wealth of experience to debate crucial issues, and hold the Government to account.The House of Lords should be reformed to better reflect British society, the ERS saidMPs are today due to discuss the possibility of holding a referendum to do away with the House of Lords after an online petition gathered more than 169,000 signatures.Just 10,000 are required to warrant a Government response.In addition to reforming the House of Lords, the ERS is also pushing to replace Britain\u0026rsquos traditional first-past-the-post voting system with proportional representation.It backed changing the way elections are held in a 2011 referendum in which the UK had the chance to switch to the alternative vote method championed by the Liberal Democrats.The electorate voted by 67.9 percent to 32.1 percent in favour of sticking with first-past-the-post."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/David-Dimbleby-975650.jpg","title":"BBC Question Time David Dimbleby retire politics show 25 years","story":" David Dimbleby retires from BBC Question Time after 25 yearsThe renowned broadcaster said it was \u0026ldquoexhilarating to bring political debate to the country, but after growing speculation about his future, Dimbleby said he wants to become a reporter again.BBC director-general Tony Hall said he has been \u0026ldquoa brilliant champion of the public.However, BBC bosses are remaining silent over who his replacement will be.Early contenders include Kirsty Young, the presenter of Desert Islands Discs, Victoria Derbyshire, who hosts an award-winning news programme, and Newsnight presenter Evan Davis.

We expect that around 1,000 claimants will be affected.I am absolutely committed to ensuring that disabled people and people with health conditions get the right support they need.The Work and Pensions Secretary faced embarrassment this morning when a damning report blasted the roll-out of the flagship Universal Credit benefits reform."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004126077062.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may must win crucial commons vote to save brexit and her job","story":"If not — and Tory Remainers successfully rule out us ever leaving with no deal — our negotiating position is toast.The EU will offer nothing.

Working mothers are often the most motivated and dynamic workers in the room.And yet working mothers still get seriously bad press.The comments by Kelly Brook this week are a case in point.She said on TV’s Loose Women some working mothers use their children as an “excuse” to skip deadlines or miss work.She also said it’s unprofessional for women to talk about children in the workplace and that “professional” women never do so.Kelly — who doesn’t have any children — made the remarks during a discussion about whether it is a mother’s job to look after her sick children.I honestly wonder what her views are founded on.Since she started modelling when she was still a teenager, it’s hard to imagine she has ever worked any kind of nine-to-five job in an office.And has she ever employed any working mums? I don’t know for sure but I somehow doubt it.I think Kelly’s comments are just founded on prejudice.I also wonder why she didn’t include men in her evaluation of working ­parents.Funnily enough men, in my experience, are way more comfortable than many women about citing ­childcare or a sick child as the reason for their absence or lateness.And most working women I know would go to extraordinary lengths to avoid “blaming” their absence on their children.Either way, Kelly’s suggestion that it’s more professional for women not to mention their children is crazy.But with views like that flying around — from other women — is it any surprise that some women worry that if they mention their children at work they will be discriminated against?I certainly know women who go to work and feel like they have to “present” as being someone without children — for fear of losing out on promotion.But if we all pretend we don’t have kids we will never change people’s opinion.So the more women talk about the fact they are working mothers — and proud — the more perceptions will change.It’s important people realise there IS pressure on a working parent — and particularly on working mums.But that’s very different to assuming the pressure makes them unreliable.No doubt when Kelly Brook has children herself, she will realise all this.And I really hope she does have kids.Unlike Luisa Zissman, who said in retaliation to her comments that Kelly will “never have children” because of her “track record with men”.That’s mean-spirited and unfair.I am sure motherhood will be the making of Kelly, just as it is for so many other women.Having said all of the above though, I will say this: There is a difference between acknowledging that you are a working mother and banging on about your kids and their achievements to anyone who will listen.Don’t get me wrong.I often talk to other working mums whose kids are at the same stage as mine about whatever issues we are particularly grappling with.But no matter how wonderful your kids are, there is nothing more boring to most people than being shown pictures of kids they’ve never met and don’t know.In other words, it’s one thing being proud to be a working mother — but we should all avoid being baby bores.The fact is, breastfeeding is not for everyone. Nor does it necessarily come down to choice – sometimes it just ain’t going to happen, for a variety of reasons.If that’s the case women should be supported, not vilified and pressured.For what it’s worth, I tried breastfeeding – for about five minutes. It didn’t work for me and, having just given birth to another human being, I didn’t feel bad about that one little bit.After all, it’s my body and I’ll do what I like, thanks very much. No one was going to tell me I was letting my kids down by giving them formula and – guess what – they’ve turned out fine. ONE of the highlights of my year was attending a private lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace last Wednesday.I left feeling bowled over by how incredible she is, so engaging and knowledgeable on so many subjects, from working mothers to football.The other thing that struck me is how very human and down to earth she is.When we were comparing notes about our various family members and how quickly they grow up, I realised we were just talking woman to woman.It really was an extraordinary lunch with an extraordinary person. IN the wake of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein it is no surprise that large companies – especially those in the film industry – are absolutely terrified their staff might behave inappropriately.But the news that Netflix has banned flirting is pretty unbelievable.It has issued a series of guidelines for employees about how to behave at work.That includes a ban on film crews looking at anyone for more than five seconds and the suggestion that anyone who feels pestered at work yells: “Stop! Don’t do that again!”Employees are also not allowed to touch or hug people for too long.It’s not that I disagree with those guidelines – try locking eyes with someone for five seconds and you’ll realise it’s creepy.It’s the fact that Netflix feels the need to issue them.I guess the company executives think their employees are in need of guidance.But the rules they have set out look, to any right-minded person, like common sense.After all, most of us know if our attention is unwanted or if someone feels uncomfortable – we stop whatever is causing the issue.And if you need a set of rules like this to tell you how to behave then there is a problem.The fact Netflix has decided it needs to do this is, frankly, a terrible state of affairs.It’s also a bit ironic given how many of the shows it makes and airs are about rape, murder and other violence against women.I guess there’s an element here of Netflix wanting to be seen to be doing the right thing.But to my mind it’s a bit holier than thou – and the company has taken it too far.CAN it really be true that Niall Aslam quit Love Island because he is insecure about his ears?If so, that is so sad. What is wrong with our young people? Actually, I know the answer to that.I can honestly say that I was never worried about body issues and none of my friends were either – it simply wouldn’t have occurred to us to compare ourselves unfavourably to everyone else.I’m pretty sure this kind of insecurity, which is rife among our young people and getting worse, is a direct result of reality TV and social media. IN the same week it was revealed that a young girl wet herself rather than interrupt her gaming, new research has proved that video games are addictive in the same way as drugs and alcohol.So what can we do about this new epidemic?There is usually an age limit for these games – and that is often ignored.But the fact is, you can’t expect the Government to sort this out: It is a parenting issue.Technology has given us many positives over the years – but it’s also caused problems that didn’t exist a decade or two ago.And this is one of them.Parents, listen up.If you want to avoid children getting addicted to games, don’t buy them.Limit the time your children have on technology.Get involved with what they are doing online and don’t just turn a blind eye.The best thing you can do is get kids out of the house – active, busy and involved in sport.Also bear in mind that if you are lazy, they will be lazy.And if you spend all day, every day, looking at your phone, so will they.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We were then told over the tannoy that the flight had been cancelled. We were escorted out of the departure lounge by the police.“There were only two members of staff dealing with everybody from the flight. There were children on the floor crying, we didn’t know what to do.“Two of our friends went down to the customer service desk and that’s when we found out that it was because the staff had worked too long. They had been working for 11 hours and couldn’t work any longer. But we booked in September, they should have been prepared.”Abi said the group felt like “criminals” as police then escorted them and other passengers out of the departure lounge.However, a spokeswoman for easyJet said if police escorted passengers away from the lounge, the decision would have been made by the airport or the police force.Abi added: “They told us there were no flights for the next week. The bride thought the hen do was going to be cancelled.“One of the members of staff even turned around and said ‘I hope you’ve got your coats because it’s raining outside’. That isn’t what people want to hear when their flight has just been cancelled.“We were basically told to leave the departure lounge, get our suitcases and leave the airport.”“In the end, we managed to get new flights through our travel agent but we had to pay £6,000 for the new flights. Half of the group had to fly from Stansted and the others from Birmingham and we had to split it onto two credit cards.“We had to sleep in the airport until the next day when we were able to travel.

Two months have passed [since the election] so it would be very strange \u0085 to say that what I told voters during the whole election campaign doesnt stand anymore.She has vowed to do everything to ensure that this country is well led through these difficult weeks.However Merkel is also facing a revolt within her own party, according to one MP.Kai Whittaker, a CDU Bundestag member, said: “We are in a serious situation because the question of the migration crisis evolved into a power question.“The question is who is leading the Government? Is it Angela Merkel or is it (CDU member) Horst Seehofer?“Everybody seems to be standing firm and that’s the problem.”He added: “This [...] has the potential to diminish the authority of her and Horts Seehofer and it could well be that at the end of next week we have a new situation.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004138588511-e1529248189990.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn signs sun reporters chest while being chased around by crazed fans at bonkers jezfest event","story":"It may sound like a scene from Monty Python’s Life of Brian but today is no laughing matter.I morph into a rugby player and shoulder barge my way through the scrum.In the middle, J.C. is posing for selfies and grinning from ear to ear.“Jeremy, can you sign my t-shirt?” I scream, batting off all the hysterical superfans.He is flanked by three burly security guards. “He doesn’t do autographs,” one booms, pushing me to the side.But Jezza steps in to save the day. Like a true rockstar he takes the pen from my hand and begins to sign my top.“Your pen isn’t working,” he informs me, smiling. “Hang on,” he adds, dipping his hand into his shirt pocket.What a charmer.After, Corbynites pursue me for a selfie.“He’s touched you,” says an awed super-fan, taking his camera out for a pic.I am the chosen one.“He left a sandal over there,” I tell them, pointing in the other direction before making my escape.Around the corner, a young Lenin - I mean Lennon - lookalike approaches, breathless. “Don’t speak to him,” he warns, pointing at a smartly dressed journalist who is politely asking revellers for their picture.Lennon’s wild, curly hair is flying in the wind and he pushes his vintage round glasses up, his nose twitching. “He’s from a right wing paper we don’t like,” he continues, excitedly. “My boss has told me to follow him and warn everyone about him. Got to go, he’s getting away.”With that, he begins to run after him in a zigzag pattern to avoid getting caught.This is North London, not North Korea. Where’s the solidarity?Not in the Solidarity Tent, apparently. Right now it is looking more like the Solitary Tent with a lone tumbleweed blowing through the dancefloor.It is 4pm. And I’m at White Hart Recreation Ground in Wood Green, London, for Labour Live - aka Jezfest.For one day only, I am living as a Corbynite and already the experience has been enlightening.After the positive reception at Glastonbury last year, Jezza fancied himself as Jay-C and decided to headline his own festival.But with a 4,000 turnout filling the 20,000 venue, it feels more like a summer fete on speed.Things could have been so different had Labour not balked at the £100,000 price tag for grime act Stormzy.Turns out the singer preferred to do it for the many (pounds) rather than the few.Which is a shame. He might have saved the day by appealing to the youths and performing his hit single “you’re getting way too big for your boots”. Which by the looks of things, Jezza could do with listening to. On repeat.Instead, privately-educated electronic band Clean Bandit were parachuted in at the last minute and tickets were slashed by 70 per cent from £35 to £10 to save the day, while one batch was given to Unite to give out for free.All in the name of equality.Which has not gone unnoticed by even Jeremy’s biggest fans today - who are still irked about this.“Jez fest?” commented one guy sporting harem pants. “More jizz-fest, I want a refund.”“I’m going to Twitter-bomb Jeremy,” moans a 56 year old dad, from Portsmouth, as he queues for food. “I came up with my wife and son and it’s cost us a bloomin’ fortune. We had to pay for trains, full price entry and it’s £5 a pint in here so it’s not cheap. I want a refund on the price difference, it’s not fair.“What’s Jeremy thinking holding this?” he goes on, as his young son looks away bored. “I’m here because I want some clarity on Brexit, and I’m hoping we’ll get some today.”Talking of which, a 30-something mum wearing a black t-shirt with the word “love and peace” shimmies past. Her adorable toddlers waddle behind like ducklings, both wearing fluorescent yellow “b*****ks to Brexit” stickers.And it is not the only obscene message. A flurry of “f**k the Tories” swamp the event. A bit much for a family event?Suddenly, a woman with brown cropped hair thrusts a leaflet into my hand. It reads: Marxism Festival 2018.“Don’t miss it next month,” she tells me, but it feels more like an order than a friendly message. “We’ve also got two Labour MPs going but they don’t want to reveal their names yet as they fear the press will call them ‘Reds under the bed’.“But it’s a very scary time at the moment,” she continues, shaking her head. “Last week 15,000 Nazis marched for Tommy Robinson. Horrible, violent lot.”Later, I look up the festival on their website, one of the workshops at the event is called Do we need violence to get real social change?Meanwhile, UB40 are speaking live via a video link on the big screens surrounding the main stage. “We wish we could be there today,” they fib, to a lacklustre crowd.The video goes down like a lead balloon and leaves everyone feeling more awkward than watching Jezza try to high five.But if I thought it could not get any worse I was wrong.Now,  columnist Owen Jones is walking onto the main stage and clarifying that he won’t be taking part in a prat battle - I mean rap battle.Instead, he breaks into an impassioned speech where he compares the Labour party to the suffragettes.After all the excitement, I’m feeling peckish so I decide to check out the award-winning street food.But I’m confused. Are they referring to the four miserable-looking stands? There’s a better selection next to the taxi rank on the high street at 2am on a Saturday.And I’m not the only one annoyed.“I’ve been queuing for 45 minutes,” explains one woman with pink hair and facial piercings. “What on earth would Jeremy have done if 20,000 had turned up? He can’t even feed the 5,000 and I don’t even think there’s that many people here.”Another pipes up, “I just paid £7 for a halloumi burger, overpriced and not worth the wait.”And my experience is not much better.After queing for over an hour for £4 cheesy nachos I’m served a stingy portion of eight tortilla chips with a sliver of plastic cheese. I’d find more cheese on the crusty lefties here than on my plate.I sneak a peek of the packet and see the tortilla chips are from Lidl, and cost 46p a packet. Not bad money if you can get it.Capitalist endeavours are rife here. Corbyn has his own stall at the entrance - where you can buy anything from Labour’s £6 manifesto to a £15 t-shirt with Jezza’s face on.But it is stalls which shock the most. The Bakers Food and Allied Workers Union are charging £10 for a t-shirt.“It’s really important the workers are looked after,” says one. I have a sneak peek at the inside label and am horrified to see it has been made in Nicaragua. Not a place known for its high standards of workplace ethics.And it is not the only stall. Love Music Hate Racism also offer a t-shirt made in Nicaragua, while the People’s Assembly are selling a t-shirt made in Honduras. All of them are made by Gildan, a low-cost producer who have been slammed in the past for using sweatshops in Central America.The outright hypocrisy is astonishing and what’s more, none of them can make the link.After listening to the Magic Numbers - a pop band who were famous 15 years ago, not one of Diane Abbott’s methods of police funding, I fancy a drink.I make my way to the bar for a “worker’s beer” - although most of the “staff” are volunteers and not getting paid.But it’s all gone Pete Tong.The card machine is down and people are moaning and groaning about having to walk to the other side of the venue to withdraw cash.Nearby, a disabled woman in a wheelchair is growing increasingly frustrated that her wheels don’t work on the grass. She does not want to sit in the segregated area for disabled people, she wants to be at the front of the stage, in the mix with everyone else.At long last, Jezza takes to the main stage, and his 4,000 disciples flock to see him. To the chants of “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn”, it seems like he is poised to break out into song. “Lenin Be”, perhaps?After JC’s latest sermon, the party’s over, and the Corbynites file out.It’s 8pm. As I make my escape, I notice one woman caught short evacuating her bowels behind a bin, just a stone’s throw from the portaloos. Part of me wonders whether her coiled offering is some sort of protest at this ramshackle event.It seems Labour would struggle to organise a piss-up in a brewery - let alone run a country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The captain performed a routine landing in accordance with standard operating procedures.“Passengers returned to the terminal whilst a replacement aircraft was sent from Berlin to operate the flight from Copenhagen to Manchester as engineers were investigating the original aircraft.“The safety of its passengers and crew is easyJets highest priority.”According to Aviation Herald, the flight was delayed by seven hours as passengers waited for another Airbus plane.The damaged aircraft remained on the ground at Copenhagen for around 23 hours before it was taken to London Gatwick for servicing.Once fixed and inspected, the Airbus was returned to service 12 hours later.Bird strikes on aircrafts are an ongoing threat but it is rare for them to cause a major aviation accident or disaster.One bird sucked into an engine can even go unnoticed until the aircraft has landed and is inspected by ground staff.However, if a flock of birds were to fly into an engine, it could cause an explosion that could throw the aircraft off balance and the pilot could potentially lose control.There are more than 13,000 bird strikes in the United States every year, but fatal bird strikes are extremely rare – occurring possibly once in every billion flying hours."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000005062407.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"spending on defence should be boosted by a third mps urge","story":"Currently the UK spends two per cent of GDP on defending the nation and its overseas interests - roughly £36bn a year.But now the Defence Committee has suggested spending should be upped to three per cent to meet multiple new threats posed by Russia, North Korea and terror groups.Dr Julian Lewis, Defence Committee chairman, said: “The Government now needs to look beyond the two per cent minimum on Defence spending, and begin moving towards a figure of three per cent, to place our defence policy on a sustainable basis to meet new threats and fill existing financial ‘black holes’.“Defence is constantly described as the first duty of government.

These things matter when you are 92.You have your favourite chair, tea cup and biscuits, and routine is important.Both of these women will have bonded during the overnight journey in the royal train to carry out engagements in ­Cheshire, with the Queen dispensing the solid, common sense advice she has learned the hard way after 66 years on the throne.They might be from ­completely different backgrounds and ­cultures but the Queen and Meghan do have a ­surprising amount in common.Obviously first and foremost they both share a deep love for Prince Harry, but they also have a real sense of duty and a desire to serve.Meghan has a lot more substance than the majority of self-centred young American actresses and, from an early age she has wanted to change the world for the better.This week she became an official partner in The Royal Foundation, joining William and Kate and husband Harry — all dubbed the “Fab Four” ­— to help charities close to their hearts.Meghan wants to make a difference. She doesn’t want to be just a clothes horse or to merely cut ribbons and unveil plaques, and I don’t believe she’d be ­content with just being a mum and virtual stay-at-home housewife like most upper-class wives. She wants to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in.Those who snarkily accuse her of self-promotion are missing the point.Meghan is canny enough to realise her new position in life means she will ­constantly be photographed and written and talked about.She knows that a new hairstyle or frock will steal the headlines but will hope people will also listen to what she has to say on poverty in Africa, equal rights for women and saving elephants.Meanwhile, her old life could be luring Meghan back to La La Land with news that her performance in Suits has been submitted for an Emmy award.A submission is a long way from a nomination, but it will be interesting to see if those in charge fast-track her into the awards category for best actress. ­Personally, I don’t think it will happen.Even Meghan would admit she wasn’t by any stretch of the imagination the best actor in Suits.If Meghan was nominated and ended up winning, it would be nothing more than a stunt to get some sort of seal of royal approval.Surely even the US entertainment industry wouldn’t be that cynical.Since Meghan met Harry, she has been compared to Grace Kelly, the Hollywood star who gave up her career to marry Prince Rainier III of Monaco.Unlike Grace Kelly, who wanted to go back into movies, I don’t see Meghan being in any way tempted back to her old life after landing the best role of all.That’s not a criticism because I admire her work ethic and single-mindedness — and I think her desire to be a force for good is genuine.The Queen is nobody’s fool and if she thinks Meghan is worth cultivating and training, the new ­American Duchess should have our approval, too.THE two new judges being wooed to join The X Factor could very well save this show’s rather tired-looking format.Robbie Williams is an inspired choice, bringing his own brand of cheeky humour but also a real empathy for all those seeking fame and fortune.I reckon, however, his wife Ayda could prove to be the real star.She’s funny, feisty and has proved to be a TV favourite during her appearances on Loose Women.Ayda won’t take any nonsense from the formidable Simon Cowell and, much as she loves Robbie, you can expect some straight-talking spats between them.Of course there are those who will say she’s only getting a seat on the judges’ panel because of her husband’s fame, but I reckon Ayda , left with Robbie, is more than up to the job and will be a much needed breath of fresh air on a panel that was looking increasingly bored and out of touch.ON World Blood Donor Day this week I repaid my debt to the NHS when my fantastic TV show team donated their very own blood (having already given their sweat and tears on a daily basis).I had to have a life-saving three pints of blood after a serious accident and, like every other patient who is given a transfusion, I am no longer allowed to donate my own.Where can I give blood? Here’s how to find a donation centre and how often you’re able to donateIt’s something that has made me feel very guilty, so I cannot thank my team enough – although there would have been even more of the precious life-saving blood if some of the boys who work with me and happen to be gay had not been banned from donating.Gay men who have had recent sex are not allowed to be donors, which surely is an edict that needs to be changed.There has to be a way to ensure safety without making gay men feel like pariahs.IN Hollywood, money talks and the box office dictates trends.So It’s good news that the all-female Ocean’s 8 has trounced the other male-dominated movies in the franchise, because it clearly shows moviegoers WILL happily pay to see films starring women in leading roles.Ocean’s 8 is a rather silly but hugely enjoyable spin on the heist movie with a satisfying end twist and decent parts for women – who are all too often usually “the wife” or “the best friend”.It shows that the appallingly bad all-girl version of Ghostbusters, a real stinker that bombed horribly, was just a blip.Hopefully, this will be the start of more big- budget films with kick-ass roles for women that aren’t twee or patronising.ALL my fellow Holby City fans know that surgeon Jac Naylor would make a polar bear shiver if she gave it one of her “looks”.She’s the ultimate ice maiden, although we have seen a little bit of a thaw in recent weeks on her return to our screens.In fact, Jac showed her human side when the character had a breakdown on screen, something that Rosie Marcel, who has played the character for 13 years, knows all about.Rosie told me that she suffered her own mental health problems after having a real-life breakdown on set.She suffered from depression and had to seek medical help.Rosie walked out of her house in her pyjamas and bare feet and even had the dark thought that her family would be better off without her.Luckily, she was given treatment and was able to get back to work, but it was a frightening time and demonstrates once again that mental health problems can hit anyone.I salute Rosie for being so open and brave about her struggle.FASTEN your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride in Poldark when the admirable Rebecca Front sails into Truro harbour like a magnificent galleon as the formidable Lady Whitworth.This ghastly harridan is the mother of the monstrous Ossie Whitworth, who has made his reluctant wife Morwenna suffer the torments of hell and even had his wicked way with her sister.If you wondered how Ossie could be so self-centred, heartless and cruel, then all will be explained when his mother heaves into view.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Say it. Sorted.”Endless repetition probably cost her a million votes in last year’s catastrophic snap election and earned her the label “MayBot”.She did it again while hailing her long-overdue £380million-a-week Brexit boost for the health service.Her NHS treatment for diabetes helped her “get on with my job”, she said.Except, it didn’t. Her Type 1 diabetes deserves sympathy and understanding, but it has nothing to do with her job as PM.To lead is to choose. Mrs May chose to lead but suffers paralysis by analysis.Since achieving her dream of leading this country, Mrs May has failed to make the right choices at a pivotal moment in British history.As a sceptical Remainer, she was perfectly placed to steer Britain through the complex task of leaving the European Union.Her first act should have been to summon her Cabinet and tell them “Brexit means Brexit”, which means every minister and Whitehall mandarin must work their socks off to make it a success.And while staring Chancellor Phil Hammond in the eye, invite anyone who felt otherwise to find another job.Instead, she boxed herself in by triggering a rigid Brexit timetable, slapping £39BILLION cash on the table and inviting Brussels’ biggest bullies to do their worst.And they did. Any idea this would be a friendly divorce has turned to ashes. We are at war with Europe, if only by another name.This week we are likely to see their Commons cats’-paws, the increasingly triumphant Remoaners, take Mrs May and the UK to the brink of abject surrender.We are being forced to repeal the verdict of our biggest ever single-issue vote by screeching siren Anna “Suck it up” Soubry and hypocrite Tory lawyer Dominic Grieve, who yesterday said he and fellow rebels were prepared to bring down the Government if they are not granted a “meaningful vote” on the final Brexit deal.Obnoxious Soubry gives even Remainers a bad name, resorting to reckless slurs of “racism” even as her precious European Union is being torn apart by rows over uncontrolled mass immigration.She shrugs off the real grounds for scepticism about Brussels — its sneering contempt for democracy and the misbegotten euro, which has destroyed the job hopes of a generation of young Europeans.These were the failures which actually led to Brexit, long before Tony Blair flung open the door to 4million foreign migrants and German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the stakes with a million more.It was Merkel, as much as Blair and David Cameron, who soured the public view of Europe’s Grand Project years before Brexit ever became a possibility.But while it is easy to condemn defeated Remoaners as sore losers, it is hard not to be impressed by their organisational zeal, which would do credit to Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxist militia.By stark contrast, all of those who voted Out — and won — are entitled to be outraged by the performance of the Cabinet’s victorious Brexiteers.What the hell have they been doing for the past 18 months?They have been caught flat-footed, ambushed in the night, bound and gagged by a richly funded, highly motivated mob of undemocratic contemptibles. They should be shot for sleeping on the job.Boris trumpets the occasional bugle call. David Davis threatens to quit once a month. Michael Gove is busy elsewhere. And Liam Fox?They never talk to each other, prepare strategy or organise tactics, let alone mobilise financial backing or communicate with 17.4million supporters. Do they too think we are all thick and racistNow we risk the horrifying prospect of remaining half-in, half-out of the EU, robbed of our vote, our hard-won rebate and £39billion in hard cash.The game may be lost by default to the dark forces of organised bureaucracy: The Civil Service, the BBC, EU pensioners such as Peter Mandelson and those faceless Eurocrats.We shot their fox in The Glorious Referendum, only to let them regroup and return as a pack of wolves with a scent of blood.They had to suck it up or risk choking on the toxic fumes.But I think it sounds more like the punchline to a particularly revolting joke which is unsuitable for a family newspaper like this.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What all cyclists have in common though is the need to stay safe on the road. That starts with the equipment you use and ends with a well-maintained bike. So let\u0027s take a look at some tips for being as safe as possible when you take to the roads this summer. Helmets save heads   From a topple when your youngest is learning to ride a balance bike through to dad wanting to protect himself on his cycle to work - everyone needs a helmet and Halfords has a range of helmets suitable for all ages and cycling abilities. Mums and Dads are covered with the Ridge All Terrain Pro for \u0026pound15. Kids can chose polka dots , princesses , stars or even an absolutely awesome skull design . Let everyone chose the helmet they love and they\u0027ll be excited to wear it when they next go for a bike ride. Be seen   Bike lights aren\u0027t just about finding your way in the dark. Increasingly people are using them like running lights on a car - for visibility. Using flashing lights means that other road users can see you more easily - and when the sun does set you can switch to constant illumination. As a rule the brighter your bike lights the better. During the day they will need to be more than 400 lumens to be easily seen, so get the brightest lights you can - like the Halfords Superbright LED bike light set, \u0026pound15. It\u0027s also worth considering high visibility jackets for big and little riders alike. Halfords has a family pack of these that contains two adult and two childrens vests. You can, of course, buy these individually too. These are especially important as the light fades in the evening and when dark winter nights eventually roll around. Adjust and maintain   It\u0027s important to make sure that you kids bikes are well adjusted to their size. Make sure that the saddle is high enough for them to be able to pedal comfortably, but also still reach the ground with the ball of their foot. Make sure that lights all work, and get recharged or new batteries as they dim. You should also make sure the bikes reflectors are in the right place and are not broken. You can get replacement reflects and other fun light accessories - like spoke lights - at Halfords. Brakes, gears and tyre pressures should all be regularly checked too. If you kids are out on their own then encourage them to tell you if anything doesn\u0027t feel right on the bike - say, brakes getting less effective. Encourage them to check the tyre pressures but back that up with monthly checks of your own. For smaller kids who cycle less you can check all these things before you go on a ride, but remember punctures can vary in size and worsen if you continue to use the bike without fixing them. Likewise, brake cables stretch over time and need adjustment to stay efficient and safe. If there are any problems pop in to Halfords for a free check on your bike, giving you complete confidence without having to get your hands dirty. In-store experts will check tyre pressure, brakes and gears. Consider a new bike for little riders   A child\u0027s bike should last at least two years before they outgrow it. But obviously everyone grows at different speeds and growth spurts make this sort of thing hard to predict. So make sure that your kids bikes are the right size for them. Halfords has a video that guides you through finding the right size bike. You can also pop into a store with your little ones to get some help and advice on the correct size. When sitting one the saddle a child should be able to reach the floor with the ball of their foot. They should also be able to stand over the top tube which runs horizontally from the handlebars to the saddle. There are also size guides on all the Halfords bike pages which help explain what height they are designed for. If you find you need a new bike consider the sort of cycling your child will be doing. If it\u0027s mostly on-road, perhaps for older children who ride to school or out with friends, then consider a hybrid like the Apollo Vortice Junior Hybrid Bike for \u0026pound104 (save \u0026pound26) . If your kids are younger or only want to ride off-road then a mountain bike is a good choice - consider the Carrera Blast Junior for \u0026pound232 (save \u0026pound58) .

Theresa May is formally unveiling the health service\u0027s 70th birthday present - \u0026pound20billion a year in extra real terms funding by 2024. But the 3.4% rise has unravelled after she refused to say how much taxes will go up to pay for it. And the PM has been panned for claiming it\u0027ll be funded by a \u0027Brexit dividend\u0027 - which experts say does not exist and a Tory MP branded tosh. Now Mr Hunt, the Health Secretary, has twice refused to give a straight answer when asked if the cash will definitely arrive. Instead he admitted NHS chiefs will have to meet very ambitious efficiency goals as part of getting the extra funds.  Critics may now fear a repeat of the NHS \u0027five-year forward view\u0027, which commanded trusts to find \u0026pound22billion in savings when it launched in 2014. Pressed by BBC Breakfast on whether the cash would definitely happen, Mr Hunt said: We\u0027ve agreed the outlines of that deal. I\u0027m totally confident the NHS will be able to come forward with a [10-year] plan that meets what we need. But as Theresa May is going to say today, we\u0027re going to have some very ambitious objectives for productivity and efficiency. Because if we\u0027re going to be putting a lot of extra money into the NHS, taxpayers want to know every pound is being spent wisely.  Pressed later on whether he\u0027d resign if the cash didn\u0027t come, Mr Hunt insisted: We wouldn’t be making this commitment if it wasn’t something we could honour. The money is going to be forthcoming and that’s why the Prime Minister made her commitment and she’s someone who keeps her word. But he refused to say how much will come from a \u0027Brexit dividend\u0027, after experts and Tory MPs said it doesn\u0027t exist. And he refused to say how much taxes will have to rise to pay for it. Mr Hunt admitted the tax burden is going to go up, but said how that happens will only be revealed in the Budget in almost six months\u0027 time. He also said the rise will be funded by economic growth and after Britain stops contributing EU budget payments to Brussels.

Mrs May promised to distance herself from Moscow-linked donors when she took office. But in the 23 months since then her party has pocketed \u0026pound201,000 from Alexander Temerko, an ex-chairman of an agency in the Russian Defence Ministry who later ran an arms company. The revelation, the latest from our investigation into Russia and the Tories, was branded “staggering” by MPs. Mrs May will tomorrow face pressure to return the cash in the wake of the attempted poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury.  We have already found evidence the Tories took \u0026pound50,000 from the wife of the ex-Russian deputy finance minister and two Tory peers are earning thousands a year from firms with Kremlin links. Mr Temerko, 52, donated \u0026pound16,300 to the Tories on July 13, 2016, the day Mrs May was officially appointed Prime Minister by the Queen. Documents show that just 24 hours later he gave \u0026pound3,750. And his most recent donation of \u0026pound3,000 last March 22 came just a fortnight after the Skripal murder bid.  The donation was uncovered after a Mirror analysis of a cache of data published by the Electoral Commission. Mr Temerko, who was born in Ukraine when it was part of the USSR, is now a London-based businessman and British citizen. He insisted to the Mirror he has been a “vocal critic” of President Vladimir Putin. However, he did not deny previously working for the Russian defence ministry or heading up Russkoe Oruzhie, a firm that produced weapons for Russian military forces.

Students piled into boats and floated down the River Cam in the annual jaunt which is known as Suicide Sunday. Not bothered by the comparatively chilly 18 degree temperatures, the students raced each other down the river with some falling into the water. Pictures show the students holding their booze bottles above the water after falling into the river. Students spent the morning making their vessels out of cardboard, glue and anything else they could find. The aim was to row from Jesus Green to Magdalene Bridge but many of them ended up being plunged into the cold waters.  Some were seen clinging onto the remnants of their boats as they paddled downstream. Suicide Sunday is the first Sunday after the end of the summer term and end-of-year exams. The day is known for wild antics as the students blow off some stream as they await their resutls.

Celia is the younger daughter of Diana\u0027s sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale, which makes her Diana\u0027s niece.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were among the guests on the day, just four weeks after their own special day.  Princess Diana broke with tradition on her wedding day and wore the Spencer family tiara rather than picking one from the royal collection.  The tiara dates back to th 18th century, and the family heirloom is now owned the Diana\u0027s brother Earl Spencer. It has been worn by several members of the family on their wedding day, including both of Diana\u0027s sisters. Celia wore the stunning tiara with a full veil and a beautiful lace-bodiced dress with a bouquet of white roses. She arrived at the church in a vintage 1910 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost and walked into the church on the arm of her father, Neil McCorquodale. The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex were full of smiles as they arrived at the ceremony.  But the new Duchess of Sussex, who was wearing a long-sleeved blue-and-white paisley dress and white fascinator, almost had an embarrassing moment when she took a bit of a stumble walking into the church. Luckily hubby Harry, who looked sharp in a morning suit, kept a firm grip on her hand.  Celia attended the royal wedding last month.

Adesanya Olamide Omolaja, 35, told police he was held at knifepoint by three men who demanded he hand over his backpack in Koh Samui, Thailand. He said the locals made their escape on motorbikes and he was devastated that his prized Apple MacBook had been nabbed. He then asked for an official police report to make his fake travel insurance claim. But when officers began investigating, CCTV showed Adesanya had left his room without a rucksack on the day he claimed to have been robbed.  The financial trader was also accompanied by a young woman - contradicting his claim to have been alone taking photographs of a house when he was robbed. Police Lieutenant Colonel Varong Thapana, Chief of Tourist Police in Koh Samui, arrested Adesanya on June 14 and the holidaymaker admitted he had lost his laptop back in England. Officers ordered him to make a grovelling apology while warning others not to make unscrupulous travel insurance claims. Adesanya said: \u0027\u0027As you have seen from the video that was what happened to me the other day.

Rimi Thapar appeared on the show looking for \u0026pound50,000 investment in her LoveRaw business. But she turned down Debra Meaden when she asked for 30 per cent stake in return for her investment in the company which makes organic, gluten and dairy-free products. She has now made the company a success on her own and said she\u0027s glad she walked away from the dragons.  Speaking to the Manchester Evening News , Rimi said: “They were just asking for way too much.  There was no way we were giving that much away. All that time I spent building the business, doing 20-hour days, I just couldn’t give a big chunk of it away.  We did want the investment, of course, but we weren’t in such a desperate position.” Thapar, a former banker, who lives in Altrincham with husband Manav and daughter Marni, two, said she doesn\u0027t regret turning down the Dragon\u0027s offer. After the show we put together an investment deck which valued the company at \u0026pound1.7m and raised what we needed through private angel investors, she said.  Appearing on the show was an amazing experience. It was a great opportunity to show people what we do and the philosophy behind our products. We are passionate about creating wholesome food that makes people feel good. The Dragons are great at what they do having the chance to pitch to them is invaluable. “It was very scary, it’s a very intimidating process. I walked in and saw these poker faces, the dragons are looking right at you. All I was thinking was, ‘don’t mess up, don’t scupper the pitch. Thapar is originally from Wolverhampton where her parents were textile manufacturers. After studying economics at university she got a job at Merrill Lynch working in its private banking arm. I really enjoyed working with a range of people, Thapar said. It was a tough job and taught me to be resilient, organised and certainly better at crunching numbers.  During her seven years at the firm Thapar met and married her husband Manav, who was from Manchester but was running an interior textile business in Spain. In 2010 Thapar quit her job to join Manav in Spain where she started to help developing the e-commerce side of his business. But then 2011 Thapar\u0027s father died after a serious illness. During her grief she started to explore the local markets where she discovered a world of fresh, organic and locally grown food. I found that eating this wonderful food made me feel better and it started me off on a health food journey, she said. I gave up gluten, and felt better, then tried veganism. I found it helped me get out of that dark and negative time. Thapar said the experience completely transformed her attitude towards food.

Abi Parker from Newport, South Wales, and 19 of her friends - including the future bride - were supposed to fly to Malaga from Bristol Airport on May 31. But the 32-year-old said the group were left devastated when the budget airline cancelled their flight without warning when they were in the departure lounge ready to take off.  Ms Parker told Wales Online : “We were waiting in the departure lounge and the flight had already been delayed for 40 minutes.  We were then told over the tannoy that the flight had been cancelled. We were escorted out of the departure lounge by the police. “There were only two members of staff dealing with everybody from the flight. There were children on the floor crying, we didn’t know what to do. “Two of our friends went down to the customer service desk and that’s when we found out that it was because the staff had worked too long. They had been working for 11 hours and couldn’t work any longer. But we booked in September, they should have been prepared.”  Ms Parker said the group felt like “criminals” as police escorted them and other passengers out of the departures lounge and were disappointed with the lack of support offered by the flight company. However, a spokeswoman for easyJet said if police escorted passengers away from the lounge, the decision would have been made by the airport or the police force - not easyJet. “They told us there were no flights for the next week, said Ms Parker. The bride thought the hen do was going to be cancelled. “One of the members of staff even turned around and said ‘I hope you’ve got your coats because it’s raining outside’.

Half of the group had to fly from Stansted and the others from Birmingham and we had to split it onto two credit cards. “EasyJet wouldn’t even pay for us to the use computers to search for new flights, we had to keep putting a pound in just to use it. “We had to sleep in the airport until the next day when we were able to travel.

Kat Lee, 32, was a just 18 when she started escorting after taking part in an adult photoshoot alongside her twin sister. During her 14 years of working in the adult industry, Kat built up a huge client list.  But now Kat, from south Manchester, has opted for a career change and started working as a barmaid as well as volunteering for charities, reports the Manchester Evening News .  Kat said: I worked (as an escort) from when I was 18 until I was in my 30s, I must have seen over a million clients.  “I was a teenager when I got into it. It started because of a photoshoot where me and my twin sister were asked to take off our tops and knickers for an adult magazine. “Later, the photographer said we would be good in adult movies, being twins, and that led to escorting. “I’m now working as a barmaid and volunteering for various charities because I love to help people. “It is weird because you’re working seven hours and you think ‘Oh my God, I could have worked one hour for \u0026pound140 instead of many hours work at \u0026pound7.’ “When you serve behind the bar and people say ‘have one for yourself’ you’re only allowed to take 20p off them whereas, when I was an escort they would buy me cars and holidays, not give me 20p tips. “I grew up in Sunderland and we were racially abused in school because my dad is Arabic, but the bullies later booked me as an escort, so I had the last laugh. “My clientele was mainly regulars in Manchester, people in the north west and businessmen stopping over at Manchester Airport.  Kat described how her usual working day often started early in the morning - seeing clients before they went to work. She said: “A typical day would start at 9am but I was never off the clock. People want mornings because they want to release themselves before they go to work. “You just don’t know when you’re going to be busy, but it’s usually dinnertime and after work at about 6pm, as well as Sundays at 3am. “I would put my clientele into two types. Some who wanted companionship, conversation and for me to be like a girlfriend - and others who would pull your hair and spit on you. So I tended not to wear much makeup because you keep having to put more on, and I tied my hair up in a bun. I would spend about an hour getting ready and showered a lot throughout the day. Kat said she experienced one frightening situation during her 14 years as an escort. She said: “I’ve only been in one dangerous situation on the job - when a client spiked my drink and took the money back after I was paid. I thought I was going to die. I couldn’t breathe or anything. I had a driver to get me to jobs and I wouldn’t have got home without him.  “I never caught diseases from clients, but I feel a lot safer in my bar job with CCTV. “I used to see four to five clients a day. You do get idiot clients who come in drunk. “One would see me when his wife had gone shopping. Another spoilt me with an Audi convertible and trips to Milan and Paris. I felt like Julia Roberts. “I never worked from home and always picked a hotel to meet the clients at. I worked at an agency for a bit but I didn’t have any power over whether I wanted to take a job or not. “If I turned down a client, the agency would fine me \u0026pound50, so I started to find my own clients. It meant I would be waiting in hotel bars for my next job and I would drink to gain confidence before seeing a client. “That led to public disorder offences and ending up in hospital to have my stomach pumped. “I found the work lonely as other women doing it would dislike me because men booked me more than them. While Kat does still work over webcam, she\u0027s unsure about returning to full escorting. “I still perform on webcam and stay in touch with regulars, but I’m not sure if I will ever return to escorting.

Ernestas Lukosevicius was repeatedly booted out of the country where it was said he had developed the necessary \u0027skills and expertise\u0027 to carry out such car crime. By April last year, the Lithuanian had racked up his eighth conviction for 23 offences, was jailed for nine months and handed his fourth deportation order. A court heard he is currently banned from returning to Sweden until February 2027. But it was between January and March this year, having moved to the UK, that the 27-year-old was recruited for his techniques to help steal valuable car parts. In that short time he and another man targeted 70 high-value BMW, Audi and Mercedes vehicles parked late at night on driveways outside homes across north Kent. In one botched theft in Swanley on March 3, a BMW caught alight and was engulfed in flames, leaving the homeowners including two young children fearing for their lives and their house fire-damaged. However, footprints found in the snow outside were subsequently matched to trainers Lukosevicius was wearing when arrested in Larkfield, near Maidstone, just nine days later. Police were alerted to a garage break-in in Carroll Gardens on March 12 and discovered the Lithuanian crouched down by a BMW. Inside his jacket was a steering wheel stolen from another BMW in the same road.  Maidstone Crown Court in Kent was told that was the only stolen car part ever recovered from all 70 vehicles. Lukosevicius, of no fixed address, admitted conspiracy to steal. His accomplice remains on the run. Prosecutor Mary Jacobson told the court that as well as onboard computers and parts, the thieves stole personal belongings from the cars including SatNavs, laptops, designer clothing, expensive sunglasses, and golf clubs. Vehicles were targeted in Gravesend, Medway, Maidstone, Sevenoaks, Sittingbourne and Canterbury. The total loss was \u0026pound503,698 although it was claimed Lukosevicius never received any financial benefit. The court was told there was no record of when he came to the UK, and Recorder Matthew McDonagh said he could not make the same recommendation for deportation as ordered in Sweden. But on jailing Lukosevicius for four years on Friday the judge told him his illicit skills had been \u0027essential and integral\u0027 to the conspiracy. This was lucrative work and in the two to three months when you and your colleague carried out those activities, you targeted whole streets and areas. It undoubtedly had substantial impact on the victims, and the targeting and stealing to order caused a high level of inconvenience and financial loss. Any suggestion you were recruited to this enterprise because of your own vulnerability cannot follow from the fact you have done this before in Sweden. You have skills and expertise which either you informed others of or they became aware of and were utilised in this spate of high-value offending. While I accept you were not ultimately benefiting from that taken and may not have been directly involved in the planning, your skills were essential and integral to what was taking place.

According to local rumours, the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex are hoping to move in as soon as the development is finished. The luxury manor house has three reception rooms, a huge walk-in wardrobe and staff quarters - so it would be the perfect home for the new couple. Computer-generated images of the development show the stone building in all its glory, including the stunning grounds and garden. But the stunning house, which is set in the Great Tew estate, has a very ironic name which couldn\u0027t be less fitting.  Bizarrely, the huge building is called Beggers Lodge.  A source told the Mail on Sunday : The property has been earmarked for a specific couple and the project is shrouded in secrecy, so naturally the assumption in the village is that Meghan and Harry might move in.  The property will take at least a year to build, which would explain why they are renting in the area for that amount of time.  According to Zoopla , the old building on the site was worth \u0026pound945,000 so the new property will likely have a huge price tag.   The Great Tew estate is just over an hour from London, and is often described as one of the prettiest villages in England. It has been managed by the Johnston Family since the 1960s. The estate\u0027s website lists some of the site\u0027s best features, including a thriving village community and excellent village services. The village also has a local shop, cafe, pub, cricket club and a primary school.

Mum Lisa, from Grimsby, has spoken publicly for the first time following the death of Courtney on November 12 last year, reports GrimsbyLive .  She has joined forces with another Grimsby mum, Karen Glean, whose son Ben died from one of two conditions Courtney was found to have been suffering - diabetic ketoacidosis - in order to raise awareness.  Single parent, Lisa, 26, said Courtney went to bed at the family home feeling poorly and never regained consciousness. The grieving mum said her farewell at Courtney’s funeral in December and three days later gave birth to her daughter, Evelyn. The mum-of-five said: “It was a strange set of emotions saying \u0027goodbye\u0027 to one and three days later saying \u0027hello\u0027 to another. She added: “It was sad that Courtney never got to meet her sister Evelyn. “I was going to call her Hope, when I was expecting her. But Courtney said she wanted to call her Evelyn. So after she died that is the name I chose.” Lisa said all of her other children will be tested for the condition that took Courtney\u0027s life. She said: “I am a lot more aware now of the condition and what to look out for.  My other children will be going for tests soon to check so they don’t have a similar condition.” “They are so easily passed off as other conditions and it is so easy to miss.” The told how Courtney began feeling unwell the Thursday before she died. She came home from school, had some tea and then went to bed. Around half an hour later she came downstairs feeling sick and later vomited. The following day she appeared to pick up but remained off school. The next day she was still tired but played a while then went to bed after lunch.  Half an hour later her mum went to check on her and came face to face with every parent\u0027s worst nightmare - Courtney was unresponsive in her bed. As she waited for paramedics to arrive, tragically Courtney suffered cardiac arrest. “It felt like a long time,” said Lisa. “After the ambulance came police arrived and we had to leave the home - we were not allowed back until they had done all these checks.” She said she said she did not know how Courtney died until results of a post mortem examination were revealed in March.  They showed she died from an auto immune disorder which affected the nine-year-old\u0027s heart, thyroid and pancreas. It also stated she had undiagnosed diabetic ketoacidosis. Lisa said: “It broke my heart to lose her. It happened so quickly, from being healthy to a few hours later leaving us. “She was my shadow. We did everything together. I was only 15 years old when I had her. “She absolutely loved her school and hated it when it was half term. She was a proper geek.” Karen\u0027s son Ben, 18, died in December. He was a popular student at Franklin College.  Lisa and Karen will be hosting an awareness day next month at Oasis Academy Wintringham to campaign for all GPs surgeries to offer children a quick pinprick test to see if diabetes ketoacidosis is present. Lisa said: “It should be routine at all surgeries.” She also paid tribute to the support she had received from Ben’s mum.  “She has been amazing and a great support and strength. If I need someone to cry to she is there and she knows what it is like to lose a child so suddenly. Since losing Ben, Karen has worked tirelessly for a national campaign to make parents and the medical profession more aware of the condition and the speed of its consequences. Some of Ben’s organs were used for transplant to give the gift of life to other patients.  Karen is spearheading the Make That Change BT1Aware campaign , along with other members of Ben’s family.  Karen said: “The BT1Aware campaign aims to provide educational establishments, GP surgeries and hospitals with the information and resources we have at our disposal to raise awareness around Type 1 Diabetes both in a medical environment to avoid further deaths and also to improve care available in schools for those already diagnosed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"parents horror after man posing","story":"NewsParents\u0027 horror after man \u0027posing as social worker tries to kidnap their 10-month-old son\u0027Sharnice Dwyer and Lee Hart, from Sutton-in-Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, have warned other youngsters could be at risk after spotting the man staring through their window\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBen ReidKev Rogers22:20, 17 JUN 2018Updated07:26, 18 JUN 2018NewsSharnice Dwyer and Lee Hart, pictured with children Lee and Skyla, are warning other parents (Image: NottinghamshireLive)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA couple have warned other parents to be on guard after a man claiming to be a social worker allegedly tried to kidnap their 10-month-old son.

Dr Jane Barton, 69, is accused of prescribing fatal overdoses of opiate painkiller diamorphine to elderly patients in the 1990s. An independent panel led by ex-Bishop of Liverpool James Jones is looking into whether she shortened hundreds of people’s lives. It has examined 833 death certificates she signed at Gosport War Memorial Hospital, Hants. A report compiled after the \u0026pound13million probe is due to be published on Wednesday. It will reportedly say Dr Barton was responsible for a number of deaths. Dori Graham said her husband, Leonard, was killed after receiving care from Dr Barton and then a fatal injection by a nurse – the probe has included deaths involving other health workers acting on her orders.  Dori, 86, said: “Len said he wasn’t in pain but they gave him the injection anyway. I sat there. Within a few minutes he was dead.” The number of people who died suspiciously under her care could exceed the 92 cases examined by police previously. Families have suggested relatives were routinely given huge doses to “keep them quiet” on over-stretched wards. Another patient Arthur Cunningham, 79, died at the hospital in 1998, but his stepson Charles Farthing said: “He went in to be treated for bedsores. There’s no way he was near death.” Concerns about Dr Barton date back to 1991, when two nurses said they believed patients were being given diamorphine instead of the sedative diazepam.

His family\u0027s rise has seen them go from staring at motors outside a showroom to owning a fleet of luxury wheels, Birmingham Live reports.   Lord Aleem has 576,000 followers on Instagram and 336,574 subscribers on YouTube , and it is through his following that he has managed to help so many people overseas.  Lord Aleem, whose real name is Aleem Iqbal, told the paper: My grandfather worked the in the Royal Mint polishing coins. My father is a self-made man who had everything against him. I am grateful for what I have been blessed with.  It is surreal seeing my own showroom when my father and I used to stare through showroom windows many years ago dreaming of owning just one car inside. Now we own the whole lot and more. I thank God everyday. As for my humanitarian work, there’s a lot more to do. BirminghamLive caught up with the celebrity YouTuber while he was on pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, having just completed a second trip to Lebanon to help provide food parcels to Syrian refugees.

But Aleem laughs about the gossip and says he\u0027s never wanted a job on the car programme, despite having a fleet of supercars himself.  I never applied for Top Gear, I don’t know where people got those facts from, he laughed. I think the current presenters are great and are doing a fantastic job. My life is Top Gear every day. My business is my baby.  My business has allowed me to live every one of my childhood dreams. I couldn’t ask for more. When you\u0027re a millionaire, there\u0027s not much you want for.

People living in Mevagissey on the Cornwall coast have voted for action after a surge in new builds being bought as holiday homes.   The average house price is now almost \u0026pound300,000, which is 20 times the local salary.  And residents of the fishing village say they are being forced to move elsewhere if they want to get on the property ladder. To clamp down, people living in the tourist hotspot held a referendum to block the sale of new builds to second home owners - with 90 per cent in favour. It comes after the Mevagissey Neighbourhood Development Plan was set up in an effort to restore the balance to the playing field for local people.  Councillor for the village James Mustoe said the vote had a 32.74 per cent turnout, with 89.58 per cent (516 people) voting in favour. Just 60 people (10.4 per cent) voted against the plan. Mr Mustoe said: I was delighted to see the Mevagissey Neighbourhood Development Plan pass into legislation following the referendum result. The landslide result, with 90 per cent of those who voted, voting for it, is a strong endorsement from our community that they want this strong and positive local planning legislation to protect the villages of Mevagissey and Portmellon now and for future generations. My thanks to all the volunteers, both members of the public and parish council who have worked so hard to bring this forward. On a personal note, I now look forward to having this publicly endorsed legislation by my side to fight for the types of development we do and do not want to see in the parish from now on.

Ruby, seven, has Pierre Robin syndrome, scoliosis and limited use of her arms as a result of missing radius bones and is registered blind. “Lily, Ruby’s five-year-old half-sister, is profoundly deaf and uses British Sign Language (BSL) to communicate. “Most recently adopted three-year-old Joseph has Down’s syndrome and uses a colostomy bag. “And it doesn’t stop there Benjamin is currently considering adopting child number five.”  The BCA spokesman said Ben talked about his passion for adoption at community groups. “He starts meetings with prospective adopters by asking them, ‘What are you looking for in adoption?’ “Many adopters start with what he calls the ‘Angelina Jolie or Madonna adoption’ — where everything is perfect. “However, the reality is that many children over four years old, and those with special needs, struggle to be placed with a family because they do not fit that mould.  “Benjamin shows them photos of his own children and tells his story - the positive and negative - and through educating prospective adopters dispels any notion of ‘normal’.” Ben is one of 29 people who will receive a medal and a certificate at the ceremony which will be hosted by Lord Dholakia.

Warning signs have also been posted around the building telling travellers: Please do not lay down on the seats. The Essex airport brought in the new policy amid claims that hundreds of passengers were camping out overnight - some of them on hammocks or blow-up beds.  But it isn\u0027t going down well with passengers, who say the move is unfair and mean to tired travellers. Under the lock-out policy, which began on Monday, the departures wing is closed after the final flight of the night. It remains shut from midnight until 2am, meaning anyone arriving at the budget flight airport during that time is directed to the arrivals area. They can take a seat and rest there, but they are banned from having a nap on the floor.  Guards are on patrol to wake up those who are fast asleep. Passengers who book early morning flights have been told not to arrive sooner than their scheduled check-in time. Stansted said it has seen up to 600 people camp out in the terminal overnight. Some travellers would rather sleep on the terminal floor instead of a local hotel, where rooms can cost upwards of \u0026pound140 a night. They can hamper overnight work or get in the way of passengers arriving later in the morning.

Islamists are taking “job swaps” from the Middle East in a scheme that runs in a belt from Somalia, Kenya and South Sudan all the way to Nigeria. It is feared the training exchanges and the networks being built could lead to the rise of a caliphate in the region – and pose a \u0026shysignificant security threat to the UK. So our military is trying to stem the tide of militants by providing counter-terror training for local forces across Africa.  The Mirror joined British and Nigerian forces at training camps in Nigeria, where a senior local commander spoke of the challenge of two-way jihadi migration. Since 2014, terrorists have murdered 20,000 civilians in Nigeria. Roadside and suicide bombings kill as many as 50 a time, three times a week. More than two million Nigerians are thought to have been displaced and 11 million need humanitarian aid. Kidnappings are rife. And the UK has already been rocked by extremism linked to the nation as Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, who beheaded Fusilier Lee Rigby in 2013, were of Nigerian descent.  Group Captain Isaac Subi, 46, of the Nigerian Air Force, has fought terror across Africa since 1991. He said Nigeria has had “hundreds” of exchange fighters. In the oppressive heat of Kaduna, we watched RAF Regiment soldiers teach his men how to beat an IS ambush. Subi, whose soldiers protect airfields, warned: “They train fighters here and our insurgents get access to training in Yemen and Syria, then come back and teach others. “When they conduct serious acts, like bombings, the news goes viral, then their sponsors think the money they give them is put to effective use. They leave trails of blood, tears and sorrow.” The terror threat in northeast Nigeria comes from Boko Haram and splinter group Islamic State in West Africa, which has strong links with IS in the Middle East. Locally, the terror threat is referred to simply as Boko Haram.  Military experts say an alliance between ISWA and Boko Haram boosts the terror risk to the UK. Boko Haram has abducted and killed \u0026shythousands – including the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapped in April 2014, many of whom were raped and forced to marry jihadists. Some of the girls have been released but many are still missing. The killings, torture and mayhem have \u0026shyworsened with the abduction of children as young as five being forced into suicide bomber cadres. Subi added: “They take over villages, overrun communities and capture children, using their innocence and giving them bomb vests. They tell them religious ideologies, ‘If you commit this suicide you will be accepted in heaven as a martyr’.”  Even the elderly are forced to blow themselves up. Subi said: “They tell them, ‘You are 70 years old – it’s better to die now and go to heaven and be married to virgins than staying here to suffer and die’.” The MoD spends more than \u0026pound8million annually on training Nigerian forces, in addition to the Department for International Development spending \u0026pound100million a year on aid. British troops were drafted in after the Chibok girls were seized and boosted an existing UK training mission in Nigeria, which now totals around 150 troops. Royal Marines based in Lagos are also teaching the Nigerian Special Boat Service how to combat crime and piracy on the coast and on rivers. British troop involvement in Nigeria is part of the British Military Advisory and Training Team and is aimed at helping local forces smash Boko Haram in Africa’s most prosperous and most populated country, with a \u0026pound405billion-a-year economy and 180 million citizens.  Our trade with Nigeria is worth \u0026pound7billion a year and 180,000 Nigerians live in Britain –while 20,000 Brits live there. Importantly, Nigeria’s population – 44% of which is under 15 – could hit 400 million by 2050, making it the world’s third-largest behind China and India. At our military HQ in Nigeria’s capital Abuja, Brigadier Charles Calder said Boko Haram and ISWA “respect no boundaries”. He added: “There are also al-Qaeda and IS affiliates in the wider region exploiting a lack of governance...which if unchecked could coagulate to form some kind of caliphate that is a surrogate of IS and if unchecked could then present a threat to both UK interests and conceivably the UK mainland.”  “One of the things I find most disturbing about this place is the coercion of very young, mainly girls, into being suicide bombers. We are here with a very small deployment that is very sustainable, that enables us to try and increase the capacity of the Nigerian army so they can deal with their own problems. “The British military set up the Nigerian \u0026shymilitary. The Nigerian army is fundamentally founded on British lines, British doctrine, British ways of doing business. “We have a big, big head-start here, because we talk the same military language. The Nigerian military trust us and have a degree of respect for the British military.” Wing Commander John Rees, 54, of 5 Force Protection Wing, commands 50 RAF Regiment trainers at Kaduna International Airport.

The pair are thought to have lost their balance as they posed for selfies on the cliff in the early hours of June 12.  But family members are now demanding investigators properly explain how the pair died.  There is concern local police have not yet interviewed anyone who was with the couple immediately before they died, the Herald Sun reported.   The couple were said to be drinking at 4am before they fell with one witness hearing a scream or shot around an hour later.  But the witness has still not been interviewed by police and CCTV of the fall has not been sought.  The owner of a bar where the couple were seen drinking has also not been quizzed by investigators. And further questions surround why the pair would have been taking selfies in the pitch black.  It has also been claimed Ms Benson was clutching hairs when she was found, which have been taken away for forensic investigation. Rui Pereira da Terra, head of Cascais port\u0027s rescue service, said: Everything seems to indicate that the fall happened when they were probably trying to take a selfie. It seems they dropped their mobile phone and fell down while leaning over to retrieve it. Mr Kearns\u0027 father Bill said he was desperate to know what happened to his son.

The 29-year-old, from the Midlands, took down the terror trio after following them into an underground Afghan cave complex. He had already blasted three other fighters with his Glock when the weapon failed and he was forced to use a hammer instead. He smashed two fighters over the head inside the narrow cave. A third man then attacked him, but he was killed with a single blow.   The soldier had volunteered to crawl into the complex in a bid to take down the extremists when they escaped from a raid on their Taliban base, the Star on Sunday reported.  He was operating in total darkness and the caves had barely enough room for one man to crawl through. A source told the paper: “There wasn’t enough room to use a long-barrelled weapon so the Brit used his Glock 9mm pistol and grabbed a claw hammer.”  “He couldn’t see the Taliban but he could hear and smell them. He shot three of them dead one after the other but then his pistol jammed.” The source described how the SAS man picked up the hammer instead and continued the battle. He said: He fought two more in the dark where the tunnel opened into a larger room which was partially lit by a candle.

tourists set to flock to city","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOpen-top bus tours are set to return to Dundee as tourism chiefs say they are “bang on target” with their vision for the city ahead of the opening of the V\u0026ampA.City development convener Lynne Short has revealed discussions are ongoing with three “major companies” to bring tour buses back.Ms Short said: “We’re already there (as a tourist destination). Tour companies are bringing people in, they’re spending time here, exploring the area, and that’s only getting better.“People visiting Scotland used to stay in Edinburgh then go for a bit of golf in St Andrews or Carnoustie and then head back to the capital. Now they can stay here.“There are discussions ongoing with three major companies with regards to bus tours.”It’s one of several initiatives being developed to further shape Dundee’s new identity as a cultural tourism destination, following widespread recognition in the media., Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and Lonely Planet have all included it in lists of must-visit cities across the world.Several cruise ships have docked in Dundee this year, bringing with them a haul of foreign tourists keen to get their selfie with Desperate Dan in City Square.However, city promotion boss Jennifer Caswell has told the Tele her focus is now on making Dundee a city break hotspot, rather than just a day-tripper destination.To that end, she and other city bosses revisited the city’s tourism strategy in May for the years ahead, to ensure they’re well-prepared for the influx of people keen to see the city during The Open next month and, from September, when the V\u0026ampA Dundee finally opens its doors.She said: “We want Dundee to be the best version of itself that it can be.“Following last month’s meeting we’re where we want to be. We’re bang on target. The V\u0026ampA Dundee is fantastic – but it’s just the beginning.”Among the ideas being considered is Dundee having ‘world hosts’ – ambassadors for the city, for which Ms Short has undergone training – and ‘Dundee concierges’, local workers who can give visitors the inside track on the best attractions to see, as well as great places to eat.Along with making Dundee more attractive to foreign tourists, Ms Caswell said she wanted people from elsewhere in the UK to come to Dundee – just as we flock to cities like Newcastle and Liverpool.She said: “We’re hearing more and more all the time when we speak to people from elsewhere that they want to come and see what Dundee is all about now – they want to know more.“We just have to make sure we can provide for them.”Investment is key to the city’s growth, including its ever-expanding directory of hotels. Sleeperz opens next month at the new train station, with Hotel Indigo shortly to follow.Projects such as those, and others all over the city, form the “spokes” around the “hub” of the V\u0026ampA, which has served as a driver to bring cash in.Ms Caswell added: “We have seen an ever-increasing number of new ventures develop in the city to service the increase in current visitors to this area.“The expected rise due to the V\u0026ampA Dundee means this is likely to increase in pace over the next few months. Being seen as a top destination in Europe to visit helps establish our reputation across the board.“We are now on the world map as a city destination, be that for visiting, working or investing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b23d75aacf3a-376x564.jpg ","title":"f keep it dundee motorists message to dvla after car

“f****** keep it”, apparently addressed to the DVLA, was scrawled across the bodywork.The car was abandoned in the car park outside Adamson Court in Lochee, and had people in stitches as they responded to a photo of the car being shared online.One wrote: “People make Lochee,” while another noted: “One of the reasons I miss Lochee.”The DVLA confirmed it had carried out enforcement action, attaching clamps to more than 80 untaxed vehicles.A spokesman for the agency said: “As part of its day-to-day enforcement, DVLA’s national wheel-clamping partner, NSL, clamps or impounds any untaxed vehicles seen on the road.“We can confirm that more than 80 untaxed vehicles were clamped in the Dundee postcode area between June 4 and 12.“It is right that we take action against those who don’t tax their vehicles and then drive them, otherwise it wouldn’t be fair to those who do the right thing.“Clamping is one of a range of measures we use to make sure these untaxed vehicles are not driven on the road.”Untaxed vehicles can pose a risk to law-abiding road users, according to the agency, as those driving without road tax may not have a valid MOT certificate, invalidating any insurance policy.If a car owner wishes to keep their car off the road for an extended amount of time, they must request a statutory off-road notice from the DVLA to avoid receiving a fine.Failing to tax a vehicle is subject to a fixed £80 fine, while removing a clamp costs £100.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/1187299-e1525270567183-940x564.jpg

Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).In Dundee, the jobs market has remained largely unchanged, with 15 fewer people claiming benefits at the end of May compared with April.In total there were 4,130

operating checkouts or other equipment.“Because the scheme is such good quality, we are confident that a high number of applicants will go on to gain employment with M\u0026ampS across its three Dundee sites after the course.”To cater for golfing fans making their way to Carnoustie next month for The Open, bar and catering staff are being recruited for the event through Dundee City Jobcentre.Jane said: “With The Open, hundreds of jobs will come up.“We will be helping to recruit for that nearer the event.“Another big development at the moment is the construction of the Indigo

out this month for staff at the new Scottish social security agency in Dundee.A further recruitment drive for the agency is expected around the end of September into early October – with the jobs

the new season.Csaba Laszlo’s new-look team will have to gel quickly if they are to get their promotion push off and running early with a testing opening to the 2018/19 campaign, which starts on August 4.The Tangerines’ first away trip is a long one to Dumfries on Queen of the South’s plastic pitch before they welcome title challengers Partick to Tannadice on August 25.Former manager Ray McKinnon’s first clash with United comes on September 15 as his new side Morton head to his former stomping ground while the last game of the season for both will be at Cappielow.That concludes a difficult end to the campaign with trips to the Highlands to face both Ross County and Inverness CT in the last month of the Championship season.United were the favourites last season to top the table but fell well short of champions St Mirren.This time around, it promises to be even more difficult with two teams coming down from the Premiership.Starting with those two, let’s have a look at the Tangerines’ main challengers this coming season.Partick ThistleThe Jags became only the second top-tier side to lose out in the play-offs and are among the favourites to go straight back up.Alan Archibald has stayed on at Firhill and is rebuilding his side for the Championship.How strong they are remains to be seen but the experienced duo of Chris Erskine and Kris Doolan will be big factors in any success they have.Ross CountyAlso coming down, the Staggies aren’t hanging about putting together a team that can win the division.Co-managers Stuart Kettlewell and Steven Ferguson are determined to make their first chance in management a success.County will be a tough nut to crack for most teams in the Championship.Inverness CTCaley Thistle were expected to be Dundee United’s main challengers last season but got off to an awful start.Boss John Robertson turned things around and a late surge almost saw them into the play-offs.Expect that good form to continue in the new campaign.DunfermlineAllan Johnston’s 2017/18 team has been ripped apart with players leaving left, right and centre.With a lot of work to be done in the transfer market at the moment, another finish in the play-offs looks unlikely but Johnston has a history of getting his sides into the top four.FalkirkFormer Dundee manager Paul Hartley is slowly making the Bairns side his own after big changes in the winter and more to come this summer.Way off the pace last season, another mediocre campaign won’t be acceptable for the Falkirk faithful.MortonFormer United boss Ray McKinnon is just in the

GREATER sense of empowerment for residents of one of the Highlands\u0026rsquo most deprived communities is being promised as part of a new plan for the area.The South Kessock and Merkinch locality plan, launched this week, details measures to boost quality of life there.Drawn up by the Inverness Community Partnership (ICP) \u0026ndash a body bringing together representatives of a range of bodies including Highland Council, police and NHS Highland \u0026ndash it includes proposals to improve support for school leavers and provision for unemployed people looking to move into work, as well as plans for a new family science event and a community clean-up.As part of moves to develop \"stronger connections for local voices\", as well as improving participation by young people and schools in community planning, there are also proposals for a new focus group drawn from local residents to support the ICP\u0027 work.This is off the back of evidence that residents have \"little confidence that their voices are heard\".Marked by lower than average incomes and a lack of qualifications in young people leaving school, in 2016 the average life expectancy in Merkinch was just 66 years \u0026ndash compared to 82 in the affluent Crown area, barely a mile away.The report stated: \"Community partners recognise that, in order for health and wellbeing interventions to be effective, they need to be delivered in the local community in partnership with existing community projects and activities.\"We recognise that our best chance of achieving success is to put people and communities at the centre of our planning and delivery processes.\"We will work with the people to tackle what matters most to them and will make a positive difference to their lives and to the community.\"Notwithstanding this, it also means that we recognise that communities can and do achieve great things for themselves.\"We need to harness such achievements and increase the level of influence and sense of control that people have over decisions and services across the locality.\"The plan also raises the possibility of support for residents to take direct control of a range of community assets.Council city centre manager David Haas said: \"We have talked to all the local communities to find out what people want to see improved and help the great work that\u0027 already being done in these areas by existing groups.\"We want to give them the encouragement to do more.\"It\u0027 down to us to listen to what people want and give them a helping hand to create the community they want.\"Dell McClurg, chairwoman of Merkinch Community Council, said it was ironic that it was apparently not told of the launch event \"until it had already started\" but agreed: \"There needs to be more help for the people who are already working at the coal-face in the area.\"She said: \"It\u0027 important that the people who live and work here are listened to.\"We live here and we know what works in this area.\"We just need the right level of support.\"Highland councillor Bet McAllister (Inverness Central) said: \"Things are really moving forward in the area and people

way imminently, with moves to review current provision for unemployed people set to start in August.

Unfortunately, it is very small and it gets very over-crowded.\"The children and teachers deserve a place to meet modern-day learning needs while the outdoor facilities will benefit the whole community.\"I think everyone will be delighted.\"Dell McClurg, chairman of Merkinch Community Council, also welcomed the news but had reservations over the loss of some open space which will be

People want it open more often and to accommodate all age groups. It could be based on water fountains/jets, as in an installation in Southend which includes colour changing lighting.Another option is to create a three-storey adjacent lido with open-air pool on the top floor and spa facilities on the first floor.A further option is to take over the nearby council-owned Nairn Leisure Centre pool, give it a glass roof and create a training and competition facility to complement a lido.The lido proposal was inspired by Bath\u0027 dramatic Thermae Spa.Lessees of the neighbouring links tearoom and James\u0026rsquo Caf\u0026eacute have put forward proposals to improve their facilities.Community leaders are excited but have urged sensitive handling of the initiative.Nairn River Community Council chairman Tommy Hogg said: \"That area is part of Nairn\u0027 heritage so they\u0026rsquove got to do it sympathetically or it\u0026rsquoll cause massive problems.\"A council consultation keen to include input from local schools and youth groups is expected to follow in August.Planning officers say \"the time is ripe for a development plan\".Their report suggests building on a trail around Nairn from the Links through Viewfield and along the riverside featuring various attractions for \"people to linger, to learn about Nairn, to take part in an activity and to enjoy their surroundings\".Each point would incorporate a theme and\u0026nbspa dolphin-inspired artwork has been mooted.A draft plan is currently evolving for Nairn\u0027 77-pontoon harbour and waterfront to improve the harbour basin, surrounding buildings and maximise its potential to boost Nairn\u0027 economy.Planned projects include expansion of the pontoon system, increasing capacity to 97 boats and to develop a watersports centre.Other than driving to the links, people generally walk there as there is no public transport to the beach area.The planners say \"there may be an opportunity to operate a land train type tourist train in the summer months, taking people round the links, the harbour, Viewfield and Fishertown.\"Alternatively, there may be potential to develop a miniature railway, of the type used at Whin Park in Inverness.\"Monday 18 Jun 2018 9:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04114000/04114012.jpg","title":"The street has no name six years on","story":"\u0026nbspTHE hunt is on for a name for an Inverness street \u0026ndash after a six-year wait.The road that runs through Milton of Leys has never been named.Highland Council said it was agreed as far back as 2012 that naming the street \"would not be beneficial as it was not providing access to a particular address\".But the council has changed tack after a complaint from the ward\u0027\u0026nbspNon-Aligned Highland councillor Ken Gowans.He said residents were experiencing difficulties directing delivery drivers and added: \"If you had a bad accident on that road how would you identify your position? \"That road is a main thoroughfare that goes right the way down Milton of Leys.

It just shows the fine margins in football.“Switzerland are a very good side but over in Basel in the second leg (0-0) I thought we were far better.“We created the better chances and on another time it could have been our night.“Looking back we probably shot ourselves in the foot as we were maybe a bit more cautious at home than we usually are.”With no World Cup action McGinn has opted to return to Pittodrie a week earlier than the rest of the squad to ensure he can make an immediate impact in the new campaign.Aberdeen enter the Europa League at the second qualifying round on July 26 and discover their opponents in Wednesday’s draw.McGinn said: “I had a frustrating end to the last campaign picking up a few niggly injuries but I’ve had a good break now which has been really beneficial.“We come back near the end of June but I’m going in around a week prior to that to give myself time with the physios before I go back into full training.“I want to get myself ready to go and am determined to do well for the team.“I’m really excited about the season as we have European football and I really look forward to those games at the start of the campaign.“Hopefully we can do well in the Europa League then make a strong start domestically, which can build belief we can have another good season.”This summer though McGinn and his Northern Ireland team-mates will be left considering what could have been after the disappointment of the play-off loss to the Swiss.In the first leg at Windsor Park last November Ricardo Rodriguez scored the only goal of the play-off from the spot after Corry Evans was adjudged to have handled.The ball clearly struck the defender’s shoulder.It prevented Northern Ireland a second straight finals appearance having advanced to the Euro 2016 knock-out phase in the nation’s first appearance at a major finals since World Cup 1986.“Having experienced the Euros and all that followed from that tournament it is very frustrating not to be at the World Cup,” said McGinn.“It was an unbelievable experience and I saw just how much it meant to the people of Northern Ireland and that group of players.“To go to another tournament would have been incredible, especially the World Cup.”Following the World Cup play-offs the SFA made a botched attempt to secure Northern Ireland boss O’Neill as replacement for Gordon Strachan whose contract was not renewed.O’Neill rejected the SFA’s advances and opted to sign a new contract until 2024.“It is one of those ones where we didn’t qualify so we just have to keep moving forward,” said McGinn.“We are happy the manager has stayed and things are very positive in Northern Ireland at the moment.”The play-off disappointment had added poignancy for McGinn as he watched it from the other side of the world in South Korea having moved to Gwangju after rejecting a new deal at Pittodrie at the end of the 2016-17 season.The switch to the K League did not work out as he dropped out of the international reckoning and struggled to get regular game time at Gwangju.He said: “I was left out of the squad for the play-offs which was disappointing as I am an experienced player.“I wasn’t playing much club football at the time so I couldn’t really have an answer to that.“However, I have shown in the past that even when I have been on the bench and called upon I have always done a good job.“I came on and scored in the Euros and played my part in that campaign as well.“Being an experienced player it was disappointing I wasn’t involved.”Following Gwangju’s relegation and change of manager McGinn’s contract was terminated by mutual consent, opening the way to a Pittodrie return where he penned a three-and-a-half year deal in January.It propelled McGinn back into the international reckoning as he was selected for the squad to face South Korea in March but had to pull out through injury.He also missed out on the end-of-season friendlies away to Panama (0-0) and Costa Rica (3-0 loss) with a groin injury that ruled him out of the final games of the domestic season.He sat out the 1-0 win against Celtic at Parkhead.McGinn said: “The lads went into that game knowing if Rangers won at Hibs and we lost, Rangers would finish second – so to achieve what we did was fantastic.“To finish above Rangers was huge considering the financial side of things and the difference in that aspect between the two clubs.“I’m not sure we were recognised as much as we should have been for that.“It was probably our best achievement in the league under Derek McInnes.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen city centre roads to close for street market","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThree city centre roads are to close while a street market takes place later this

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

By taking part in Walk Your Way you’ll be helping to reduce your own risk of stroke, and the vital funds you’ll raise will help the charity to support more stroke survivors to regain their independence.Sign up to Walk Your Way now: stroke.org.uk/WalkYourWayMichael Lynagh, former Australian rugby union internationalSir,What is it with people who drive cars while doing other things?As a driver I often see people behind the wheel talking on mobile phones, sending texts, touching up make-up in the mirror and, on a few occasions recently, the same man has been shaving while bowling merrily along the A83 trunk road \u0026#8211 while in a van belonging to an Argyll and Bute public agency.It just takes a split second for an accident to happen through losing concentration behind the wheel.Put down your smartphone, make-up bag and electric razor before either the police catch you or an accident happens.Name and address supplied\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"harbour gallery open entry call from tarbert golf club","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 01/06/18, 5:48 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSunday June 3, sees the Stuart Herd Harbour Gallery Open take place at Glenralloch with an entry fee of £15.The club is hopeful that the recent good weather will encourage a healthy turnout of competitors for this popular event.There are four nett prizes and four scratch prizes on offer with the winner receiving one of Stuart\u0026#8217s stunning prints of a scene from Tarbert golf course.To book your entry please call the club at 01880 820565.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

There is also a small fee to be paid by each exhibitor for every painting or photo that is hung, and this goes to help to cover running expenses.With over 500 people having visited the exhibition in 2017, organisers hope this excellent support from the community will continue. Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"brave mum set skydive charity","story":"NewsBrave mum set to skydive for charity for inspirational nephewJoanne Dunlop, of Ayr, will jump from a hair-raising 10,000ft at Skydive St Andrews.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet10:32, 15 JUN 2018NewsMegan Mcphearson and Joanne Dunlop\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brave mum is set to take to the skies for her inspirational nephew.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"council perform u turn over","story":"NewsCouncil perform U-turn over car park feesThe astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston15:41, 13 JUN 2018NewsSouth Beach car park (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailParking charges WON’T be introduced at two Troon car parks, we can reveal. The astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses. The council ARE pressing ahead with fees at a third Troon car park, at Bellevue in Prestwick and Ayr Blackburn. They argued the \u0026pound2 charge would destroy much-needed trade and lead to chaos in surrounding streets in Troon The U-turn was revealed by Councillor Craig Mackay at Troon Community Council last Tuesday. He managed to finally nail down an answer from his officials, admitting: “This issue has caused confusion within the council.” There will be no charges at the car park at the Walker Hall or the Italian Gardens.  But council officers are pressing ahead with a \u0026pound2 fee at the South Beach car park next to Royal Troon. This lead to anger from Community Councillor Robert Milligan, who said: “I suggest if you are going to charge for South Beach you actually need to provide loos, even temporary between May and September, to meet demand. If people are paying for parking the least we can do is to have toilet facilities without peeing in the dunes. “People are urinating in the sand dunes and residents can see it from their houses.” At the community council police revealed Troon only gets a traffic warden once every 2.8 days. And townspeople feared cars would be abandoned on the streets rather than pay for parking. The Ayrshire Post has led the way on the issue, revealing Troon has NEVER had to pay parking fees. Councillor Mackay said: “ We were working on the basis of parking charges being introduced to three car parks in Troon.  “I had a meeting with senior officers to discuss concerns of residents and businesses, in particular at the Walker Hall. “The knock-on conserquences are complex, particularly with displacement into residential streets.” He finally got an admission the council were axing the charges in a statement from SNP party colleague Ian Cochrane. Councillor Mackay added: “I was still struggling to get full clarity. “Traffic Orders are being progressed at Royal Troon, Belevue Road in Prestwick and Blackburn Road in Ayr. “It came as a surprise to me as the statement said no other parking charges are proposed at this time and that is quite a changes from what we were looking at.” Troon council vice-chairman Dougie Graham added: “We will wait to see what happens.” Five days after being asked for a comment on the U-turn, South Ayrshire Council would only say: “We’re currently finalising plans for the introduction of charges at Blackburn Road, Bellevue Road and Troon seafront car parks – all of which will require a new Traffic Regulation Order (TRO). We’ll soon be getting the TRO process underway, which will include a period of public consultation, and further details on this will be shared in due course.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United.

The couple’s wedding party consisted of bridesmaids Sara Bryce (bride’s sister) and Lyndsey Bickerton and best men Grant Russell and Mark Rowe (groom’s brother). The newly married Mr and Mrs jetted off for a fortnight in the sun after the big day.  The couple said: “We flew to St Lucia for 2 weeks and stayed at The Royalton. “It was amazing - so relaxed, exactly what we needed after the wedding.” Adore Weddings captured the couple’s big day, with both photography and videography, leaving them with lovely memories to look back on. Mhari added: “Both Barrie and Jim were fantastic all day, with us and all the guests. “The pictures are just too hard to pick from.” Stems and Gems in Saltcoats created the bouquets, buttonholes and flowers for the centrepieces while the cake was made by a relative.  Mhari said: “The cake was made by my aunt. “It was baked in Norwich then driven all the way to Scotland and built. “All the flowers are made of icing to match the flowers in my bouquet.” Linzi of Linzi Smith Hair at Distinction styled the hair for the day while Elaine Sawyer of Lookz Mobile Makeup Artist created the makeup looks. The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who travelled the distance to make our special day - some all the way from Texas. “Also a massive thank you to Ryan and Stacey of The Waterside - our day ran perfectly all thanks to them.” For more photos of this week\u0027s Wedding of the Week, pick up your copy of the Ayrshire Post.

Stuart Laing gets a glittering OBE for nearly 50 years hard graft in the shiny world of jewellery. And Kirsty Letton is now an MBE after more than four decades of dedication to Scottish curling. That they live within 500 yards of each other in Troon is highly noteworthy in that NOBODY else who lives in mainland Ayrshire received anything this year. Stuart,68, has been honoured not just for running the family’s firm Laings, but his foundation of a UK consortium that allowed independents to flourish. He said: “I am thrilled and delighted to speak about it . . . this has been very difficult not to mention.  “I am proud and honoured, but also very humbled as well.” In 1970 he joined the family firm which was begun 130 years earlier. He expanded it to seven branches and started the Houlden (his mother’s maiden name) buying and professional services group for independent jewellers. Stuart remains active as executive chairman of Laings, though his son-in-law Joe Walsh is now chief executive. The father-of-three and now grandad-to-five has been such an influence in the jewellery market he’s regarded by the trade throughout the world. He said: “Strengthening and creating a strong, independent retail sector and giving the UK industry a global identity has been extremely rewarding.” “But this honour is for my entire family and colleagues as a lot of people have been with me on this journey.”  Stuart and his wife Lynda have three children - son Simon and daughters Susanna Laing, and Wendy Walsh. Stuart added: “I would like to pay tribute to my wife Lynda, she has been a wonderful support, a real rock. “We have travelled the globe together representing the UK trade.” He also created the ‘Jewellers of Excellence’ brand, which is a hallmark of trust within the industry. Stuart has been involved in all aspects of the industry and was the only UK Director of SIHH (Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie), a renowned association of the best jewellers in the world, in co-operation with high-end watch houses. Curling champion and coach Kirsty Letton reckons her MBE is an accolade for the entire sport. She says: “Of course I am thrilled and proud. It was a big surprise, I must admit.”  And so are the family - husband Jimmy and children Avril, who now lives in Ascot, and Keith who is in Grenada. Superfit Kirsty - now a 77-year-old grandmother of three - is still playing on the rink as well as coaching at Ayr and manages to find the time to grab an oar for some coastal rowing. Last year she picked up a Sportscotland lifetime volunteering award. And although moving to Ayrshire 21 years ago and joining the Troon Portland club the link with her orginal Glasgow four has never been broken. The highlight of Kirsty’s playing career was winning senior silver in the World Championships in Finland in 2008. She is particularly proud of motivating South Ayrshire primary pupils to have fun on the ice, with 269 youngsters participating in her taster sessions last season.  As well as inspiring the stars of tomorrow, Kirsty instigated the strongly contested World Senior Curling Championships in 2000. She also set up the Glynhill Ladies Curling International event, which attracts world-class teams. Kirsty added: “I don’t know where I would be without curling. It has been a huge part of my life for 40 years. “Last week Ayr Curling Club got the active schools gold award for South Ayrshire and it is things like that which keep me going.” Ayrshire’s Lord-Lieutenant Iona McDonald congratulated the pair. She said: “They have made a considerable contribution to our communities and I am sure that this award comes as a great surprise, as many of them do not seek any recognition for the work that they do. •The Edinburgh-based business grandee Sir Brian Gammell Ivory, gets a CBE for his chairmanship role at Dumfries House.

The bill for absent workers comes on the back of 42,736 days lost during the last 12 months. Employees recorded an average of nine days on the sick during 2017/18. Psychological reasons (30 per cent) were cited as the leading cause for absence, followed by musculoskeletal (19 per cent) and hospitalisation (12 per cent). By far the biggest service to feel the strain was the Health and Social Care Partnership, where an average of 16 days per employee was lost. Teachers, who account for 23 per cent of the council’s workforce, were the best performing ‘directorate’ with a loss of just five days per worker.  All figures were recorded between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Council officials said trends were showing a “gradual and consistent improvement”. An average of 11.7 days were lost to absence by local government employees (all staff bar teachers) in 2010. The revised figure stands at 10.06 days for 2017/18. A council spokesman said they were “committed” to supporting staff and have a “number of policies and supports in place to maximise employee attendance”. They added: “In recent years, more robust monitoring and reporting arrangements have been introduced which have seen a steady improvement in this area, with our figures below the national average. “We continue to closely monitor employee attendance levels and take all appropriate steps to ensure appropriate standards.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Steam returns to the Borders Railway","story":"STEAM

with Post Office bosses soon put a stop to the idea.\nWhile the town has been without a permanent service, a mobile service has operated for several hours each Friday in Innerleithen, forcing residents who urgently need to make postal deliveries to travel east to Walkerburn, or west to Peebles to do so.\nA spokesperson from the Post Office told us that, while plans are yet to be finalised,

For services to the Scottish seafood industry.\u0026#8217Mr MacMillan, from Carradale, East Kintyre, has already been invited to the Palace of Holyroodhouse garden party on Wednesday July 4.During more than half a century in the industry, Mr MacMillan, 72, has moved from working on a fishing boat, ring netting herring, to fine tuning a computer-controlled smoker to create smoked products for worldwide export.Mr MacMillan, has six employees, one of whom said: \u0026#8216Archie was awarded an MBE for being the best boss.\u0026#8217He took control of the artisan business in 1988 and has incrementally improved it ever since, eventually buying a £60,000 computer controlled smoker which it took him three months to fine tune.Mr MacMillan\u0026#8217s life in the seafood business started at the sharp end. Aged 15,  in 1961 he went to sea in the Amy Harris with an uncle.Mr MacMillan, who eats fish most days, said: \u0026#8216Sometimes in the mid-1960s we were earning between £9 and £11 a week which was a good wage.\u0026#8216It was spring 1962 when we started fishing for scallops and the price of a dozen sold to London was 12/6.\u0026#8217It was a brother of his mother, Mary MacMillan, née Paterson, Archie Paterson, who taught him all he knew, in a decade aboard Harvest Queen.By 1972 some Clyde boats were gearing up for pair trawling, where a net is trawled between two boats.Mr MacMillan, helped with a £12,000 loan from the Highlands and Islands Development Board, bought his own boat, Remembrance, from Finlay Cunningham.For pair trawling Mr MacMillan worked with a partner James Rennie on Monarch and in the 1980s they began exporting scallops to markets, including Belgium, Barcelona and Johannesburg.At the same time as fishing from a boat Mr MacMillan was learning about smoking products.\u0026#8216I used to come to the smokehouse when the weather was too bad to go out on the boat,\u0026#8217 said Mr MacMillan, \u0026#8216That is how I learned to smoke fish \u0026#8211 such as kippers.\u0026#8216It was different days there were not environmental health officers coming chapping at the door,\u0026#8217 added the man who has a prized certificate from SALSA \u0026#8211 Safe and Local Supplier Approval for hot and cold smoking of salmon.

The Depute Procurator Fiscal said he believed the practice of young men going at night to farms was becoming very common, farms when the men were absent being singled out for attention and the conduct of the accused on this occasion was, to say the least, pretty bad.A number of farmers had informed him that their one objection to joining the Volunteer Force was that if they left the house at night occurrences of this kind were sure to take place.Theft of rhododendron bloomsA girl residing in Campbeltown was charged with having, on May 28 in the grounds adjoining the public road from Carradale Post Office to the pier, and beside the entrance gate to Carradale Stables, stolen two rhododendron blooms.Accused admitted taking the blooms but said she did not know they were private property.She had gone to Carradale to inquire after a situation and was returning to the ferry when she spotted the flowers and climbed over a wall to get them.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"st columbas conventicle","story":"All religions have a mixture of good and bad points as do most political parties.When dealing with history, too, there are some literal truths, which both ministers at last Sunday\u0026#8217s Keil St Columba\u0026#8217s conventicle appeared to skip past.It was mentioned that the 6th century missionary based his teaching on a Bible written in Latin, but not that his name translated means \u0026#8216dove,\u0026#8217 a potent symbol of peace.In addition, at that time before the schism with Rome, St Columba, who also spoke Gaelic, offered the pagan hordes an education and health service rolled into one, with its roots in Europe.St Columba and his monks were the educated people of their time.While the medicine might well have been rudimentary, it was based on the learning of the Roman empire.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.

Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.

The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.  He is also banned from having more than two visitors to his property at any one time except those who are there in the course of their employment.  Mr Conner had received an interim ASBO earlier this year.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThere is a significant history of anti-social behaviour complaints made against Mr Conner which has caused considerable alarm and distress to others.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, with the full support of Police Scotland, will take the strongest possible action against those who behave in an anti-social fashion. This includes applying to the sheriff court for anti-social behaviour orders against those whose persistent behaviour causes alarm and distress to others."},{"url":null,"title":"Modest WW2 veteran Len given France  39 s highest military honour","story":"              A PENCAITLAND man who has received France\u0026rsquos highest military honour for his service during the Second World War says he did not even think of himself as a veteran until recently.  Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

Plans to close Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School were revealed last autumn.  East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.

Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.

East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.

They are one of four one-act plays that will take part in the Scottish Community Drama\u0026rsquos National Youth Drama final in Plockton on Saturday.  The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment. In particular I am so glad that we have progressed with this play.  \"After a reading the script during one of our sessions the girls were behind it one hundred percent, here was a piece that they could relate to and completely identify with.\"  And some of the cast, pupils at North Berwick High School, are equally looking forward to taking part.  S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Calls to tackle Edinburgh Bypass gridlock as tram system to Musselburgh mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7868119.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"12 new rules the council is making over selfish parking in Musselburgh","story":"              A RAFT of traffic restrictions are to be introduced in Musselburgh to control inconsiderate parking.

Thousands of supporters took to the streets on Sunday to cheer their national team\u0026rsquos long-shot win against the World Cup holders in Mexico\u0026rsquos first match of the 2018 tournament.  The 1-0 stunner, with Hirving Lozano scoring the winning goal, has given Mexicans hope that their team might win the tournament for the first time.  Mexico has competed in the Fifa World Cup since the sporting event kicked off in 1930, but the highest they have ever advanced is to the quarter-finals in 1986 and 1970.  Lozano\u0026rsquos goal set off such a commotion that seismic detectors in the capital registered a false earthquake, which the geological institute said may have been generated by \u0026ldquomassive jumps across the city.  Spectators who had gathered to watch the match on a big TV screen in the central Zocalo square screamed with joy after the goal.  After the match, throngs of fans dressed in green converged around the famous Angel of Independence monument, bouncing with joy and waving the Mexican flag.  Groups chanted, car horns blared, whistles were blown and drums beat for hours after the match.  \u0026ldquoWe aspire to win a World Cup this time, said Miguel Paez, a 31-year-old who donned a Mexican wrestling mask in the colours of the national flag as he celebrated on Mexico City\u0026rsquos main avenue, Paseo de la Reforma.  He described the game as a welcome distraction from Mexico\u0026rsquos upcoming July 1 presidential election. \u0026ldquoMexico needs a break. Mexico needs to shout, he said, jumping up and down.  The win has also helped Mexican fans move beyond the team\u0026rsquos recent indiscretions after the squad entered the tournament under a cloud of scandal.  The problems began last year when the US Treasury Department accused team captain Rafael Marquez of being a front man for a drug kingpin. The accusation cost Marquez sponsorships and called into question whether he would play in the tournament.  He took to the field as a substitute towards the end of the match against Germany, notching an appearance in a fifth World Cup.  Also, earlier in June, gossip magazine TVNotas reported that nine members of the squad indulged in an all-night party with 30 female escorts following their farewell match against Scotland in Mexico City.

Two fans, James Lockett and Billy Grant, were among an official party who paid tribute in the city\u0026rsquos Hall of Military Glory, in the heart of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial park commemorating the Battle of Stalingrad.  The group also included British deputy ambassador Lindsay Skoll and FA chairman Greg Clarke.  Three Lions manager Gareth Southgate pointed to the \u0026ldquoperspective the war-ravaged history of Volgograd, which was formerly known as Stalingrad, had given his team ahead of the World Cup opener against Tunisia on Monday.  And more than a dozen England fans turned out to watch the ceremony, which began with a short display by the Russian soldiers who guard the site.  Volgograd is the site of one of the bloodiest battles in history, with estimates suggesting the number of troops killed, captured or wounded on both sides totalled nearly two million.  Historians believe the Soviet defence of the city, on the banks of the Volga river, was a turning point for the Allies against Hitler\u0026rsquos forces in the Second World War.  A huge monument known as The Motherland Calls looms on the hill overlooking the Volgograd Arena and the memorial park is a short walk away from the stadium.  The city is also twinned with Coventry, after women from the Midlands city wrote to express support during the war.  Ms Skoll wrote in a book of commemoration: \u0026ldquoMay our bonds between the people of the UK and Russia remain forever strong and enduring.  She told reporters: \u0026ldquoAs you know the links between the UK and this great city are strong and enduring.  \u0026ldquoThey were forged during the Second World War, with shared experience of destruction and devastation and immense bravery, and started by 900 women in Coventry, who sent messages of support and solidarity to their sisters in Stalingrad.  Ms Skoll spoke about shared values between the two nations.  And she added: \u0026ldquoGiven the immense suffering of Volgograd and the pivotal part it played in the route towards victory I think it\u0026rsquos only fitting that the 2018 World Cup should have Volgograd as one of its host cities, after all Volgograd today plays host to people from all over the world including Great Britain, who are here in peace and with a common purpose.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.

Painted on a 60ft by 40ft wall overlooking the city\u0027s Clutha bar, it features a portrait of Mackintosh looking through a stained-glass window.  The street art was commissioned by Radisson RED and designed and created by Art Pistol Projects and well-known Glasgow street artist Rogue-one as a gift to the city.  As part of the project, Radisson RED has donated \u0026pound1,000 to The Clutha Trust, the charity set up after 10 people died when a police helicopter crashed onto the roof of the pub in November 2013.  Michael Weston, curator at Radisson RED hotel in Glasgow, said: \"After opening our doors in April, we wanted to give something that showed our commitment to the local art scene as well as the city of Glasgow itself.  \"It was important to us that the mural represented a key piece of Glasgow\u0027s history, so commissioning a mural of one of the city\u0027s most iconic artists, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, was perfect.  \"It is a fitting tribute to one of Glasgow\u0027s greatest talents in his 150th anniversary year - and I\u0027d encourage everyone to come see it.\"  Born on June 7 1868, Mackintosh trained as an architect and went on to create much-admired buildings including the Glasgow School of Art and Scotland Street School in Glasgow.  The mural was given the go-ahead following a planning row after an objection from a neighbouring business.  Alan Crossan, owner of the Clutha bar, said: \"This mural is a fantastic piece of artwork and a fantastic donation to the Clutha Trust.\"  Bobby McNamara, known as Rogue-one, is renowned for his photo-realistic style and is behind a number of artworks in Glasgow, including Mitchell Street\u0027s floating taxi.  Mr McNamara said: \"From the original design sketch to the completion of the mural, it\u0027s been hard work but of course great fun.  \"Using scaffolding to access the wall was awkward at times as it\u0027s hard to see what you\u0027re doing, but I pushed on utilising my skills and experience. In the end I think I achieved something special.\"  Ali Smith, founder of Art Pistol Projects, said: \"Mackintosh is a bit of a global superstar so we had to get this one right.  \"Stepping away from the wall now it really feels like a special one, a just portrayal of such an iconic and well-loved figure.  \"Everyone that\u0027s been involved deserves a big thanks.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7936576.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Singing for England  Musician   s rallying call for Scotland to get behind their old rivals in World Cup","story":"              A SCOTTISH musician has issued a rallying call for his countrymen to get behind their old rivals in the World Cup.

The BAFTA award-winning musician says that the majority of Scots have been supportive of the song.                         .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default .vjs-tech { position: static !important }                       .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default { height: auto !important width: 100% !important}                       .vjs-playlist-description { display: none }                       .vjs-big-play-button { top: 0pxleft: 0pxright: 0pxbottom: 0pxmargin: auto }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist { background-color: #f7f4f1color: #000min-width: auto }                       .vjs-playlist cite { overflow: initialtext-overflow: initialwhite-space: initialfont-weight: 600font-size: 16px }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist time { color: #fff }                       cite.vjs-playlist-name { text-align: left }                       .story-credits { margin-top: 20px }                       #liveMultiHide .vjs-dock-description { display: none }                       .vjs-playlist-thumbnail { margin-right: 10px !IMPORTANT }                        /* Style the overlay */                        /* Hide the overlay */                        .hide-countdown {                            display: none                        }                        .hide-overlay {                            display: none                        }                        /* Style the overlay */                        .vjs-overlay,                        .vjs-overlay.vjs-overlay-top {                            position: absolute                            top: 0px                            left: 0px                        }                        .vjs-overlay p {                            width: 100px                            background-color: #000000                            color: #fff                            padding: 10px                            margin: 0                            margin-bottom: 0                            border-radius: 0px                            text-align: left                        }                                               width=\"100%\"                            data-account=\"64298557001\"                            data-player=\"rkgvgWjWCG\"                            data-embed=\"default\"                            data-video-id=\"5798536909001\"                            class=\"video-js\"                            playsinline                            data-random-id=\"1047840825\"                            controls  And Chris says that any of his compatriots opposed to his support of the Three Lions should speak to the owners of whisky distilleries in the north of the country, who enjoy the benefits of their strong English customer base.  The father-of-one said: \"I came at it with the idea of how much Englishness can I manage to cram into one England world cup song?  \"It made for a challenge and an opportunity for a kind of humble gesture of support to our friends south of the wall.  \"It\u0027s been a surprise that the song has gotten such a brilliant response up here from all kinds of Scots who rightly feel that what\u0027s good for England is only good for us.  \"Many of us have English friends and family, and many of us go on holiday, or to university or to work in England. That works in reverse order too obviously.  \"I\u0027ve done this with a humble heart, trying to support our fellow islanders.  \"The cultural and economic links between Scotland and England couldn\u0027t be deeper.  \"To the tiny minority of Scots who get spiteful about the English football team, I\u0027d say go and have a chat with the whisky distilleries up north and ask them how they\u0027d feel if they lost their English customer base.\"  The singer-songwriter won a BAFTA for his music in the thriller film Killer.  He has also written promotional material for Creative Scotland, Jura Whisky and the World Health Organisation.  It is not the first time that a Scot has written a World Cup song for their neighbours south of the border with Lonnie Donegan penning the 1966 song World Cup Willy.

He added: \"Scotland will make it into the World Cup soon enough and you can be sure I\u0027ll be on the case with a Scottish world cup song when that day comes.\"  The Football Association in England has not commissioned an official squad single to mark the competition despite previous efforts such as World in Motion proving to be very popular.

But Sir Brian Souter, who has also ploughed in part of his fortune to the SNP, has taken aim at his fellow millionaires.  At a prayer breakfast earlier this month, the transport tycoon said the most \u0026ldquonarcissistic and \u0026ldquoself-obsessed people he had met were rich.  He added that wealthy people are in need of \u0026ldquotransformation in their lives just as much as heroin addicts.  Souter and his sister Ann Gloag made their money by founding Scottish-based bus company Stagecoach, which also owns coach operator Megabus and South West Trains.  Stagecoach serves around 2.5 million passengers a day and the transport giant also operates in North America. Souter and Gloag were said to be worth \u0026pound920 million, although it was reported last year that the siblings had split their wealth in order to follow \"different investment strategies\".  Souter is also known for his charitable giving via his family trust, which has awarded more than \u0026pound32 million over the last three years.  An evangelical Christian who is linked to the Church of the Nazarene, the tycoon\u0026rsquos charity is interested in projects that relieve human suffering and promote spiritual welfare.  Souter recently fronted an event in Edinburgh at which he promoted the theory of \u0026ldquotransformation, which in Christianity focuses on changing individual lives.  He interviewed a former heroin addict, Alfie McCracken, who told of how he used to be homeless and had considered taking his own life.  In conversation with Souter, McCracken said his life changed after he visited a church in Largs and was \u0026ldquosmothered in love. He said he found Jesus and stopped using drugs.  Souter then made a speech in which he said \u0026ldquorules and \u0026ldquorole models are not enough to transform lives, a process that also requires a \u0026ldquoredeemer.  He claimed McCracken had found his redeemer: \u0026ldquoWhen he [Alfie] had an encounter with Jesus Christ, transformation happened in his life. When a supernatural power, greater than his own, was able to deliver him from the addiction of heroin.  However, he added that other individuals did not feel their own lives required the same change: \u0026ldquoI meet a lot of wealthy people in my walk of life, and let me tell you, they need transformation just as much as Alfie.  Souter added: \u0026ldquoThe most narcissistic, self-obsessed people I have met have had a lot of money, and I don\u0026rsquot find that amongst the homeless. The truth is we all need transformation.  The tycoon\u0027s political donations have attracted more attention than his charitable giving. Souter has donated over \u0026pound2m to the SNP and pro-independence causes, including sizeable pre-election donations.  He also spent over \u0026pound1 million in 2000 bankrolling a private referendum opposing Government plans to repeal anti-gay rights legislation. His high-profile campaign was widely criticised by MSPs, who believed he was hijacking democracy in a bid to keep a discriminatory law.  Christian Wolmer, who wrote a book in the 1990s which charted the rise of Stagecoach, said of Souter\u0026rsquos remarks:  \u0026ldquoI am glad that Brian is prepared to be critical of some of his fellow millionaires but it is a mistake to think that only religion offers solutions. If the rich paid taxes commensurate with their income and their wealth, then there would be sufficient money in the public services to ensure that there would be fewer people like Alfie who find themselves in bad situations.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe rich need to develop a social conscience, recognise the problem of inequality and be prepared to put back into society what they have gained from it. To be fair, I do recognise that Brian does that."},{"url":null,"title":"How did we determine the weather pre-digital age ","story":"              THERE\u0027S a storm coming. I can feel it in my throbbing temples and in the oppressive, muggy heat that\u0027s been building all day. I also know from this morning\u0027s radio forecast that thundery showers are expected by nightfall but having just read a book that claims humans don\u0027t need professional meteorologists to predict the weather, I have switched off all my gadgets and determined to study the world around me for clues as to when the storm will break.  This, after all, is what our ancestors did. \u0026ldquoIn the past, writes Peter Wohlleben in The Weather Detective, \u0026ldquoit was vital that everyone could recognise and interpret these signs. People were dependent on nature and intimately familiar with it.  So highly attuned were they to nature\u0027s sights, scents and sounds that in the centuries before barometers, clocks and digital calendars, humans used those signals not only to predict the weather but to establish the time of day and season of the year.  These days, most of the UK population is urban and even here in Scotland, where 98 per cent of the landmass is rural, only 20 per cent of us live in the countryside. But if we think our ancient bond with the natural world no longer matters we are dangerously deluded, argues Wohlleben, a German forester whose last book, The Hidden Life Of Trees, was an international bestseller. \u0026ldquoIn the face of climate change and damage to the environment, he argues, \u0026ldquoit is more urgent than ever that we recognise and understand the signs of nature. Only then will we appreciate what we stand to lose.  With those ominous words ringing in my ears, I step out through my front door and prepare to tune in to those elemental messages, but instead find myself negotiating a sensory assault course of traffic noise, reeking dustbins and ugly building sites.  Once inside the fecund haven of my nearest park, however, I sit on the grass and look heavenwards as our great, great, great grandparents would routinely have done before deciding whether this was a good day to sow their oats or bring in the sheep, cast their nets or batten down the hatches. Their existential dread of spoiled harvests and shipwreck was written into folklore and Met Office research conducted last summer suggests 75 per cent of us still set store by those old proverbs, particularly the one about a red sky at night foretelling shepherd\u0027s (or sailor\u0027s) delight, which 70 per cent of us believe. And apparently we are not far wrong, since that nocturnal rosy glow is caused by the high pressure associated with good weather. \u0026ldquoHigh pressure traps dust and dirt in the air, which scatters blue light, only leaving the red remaining \u0026ndash hence the reddish appearance of the sky, explains the Met Office website.  A red sky in the morning, meanwhile, actually does act as a reliable shepherd\u0027s (or sailor\u0027s) warning since, as Wohlleben explains, \u0026ldquothe sun rises in the east, where the sky is clear, and shines onto the clouds gathering in the west, which will rapidly spread and fill the sky.  Useful as it may be, that old adage is no help to me now in the middle of a sultry afternoon so I decide to examine the clouds themselves, which people seem always to have known were linked to weather even if they didn\u0027t understand the scientific reasons. In Greek mythology, clouds were nymphs who gathered river water in cloudy pitchers before ascending to the sky where they floated around in billowing robes, emptying the contents over the earth. Ancient Hindu tradition construed clouds as heavenly white elephants, which used their trunks to shower rainwater over the land below. And for the Native American Navajo people, clouds were formed by the flapping wings of a great white swan.  As we now know, of course, the more prosaic explanation is that low pressure causes water vapour to condense into droplets or ice crystals. Thinner cloud lets more light through and so appears white. \u0026ldquoIf you see tall, towering clouds on the horizon, it means rain (or snow) is likely soon, writes Wohlleben. \u0026ldquoIf they seem to puff out at the top, or form an anvil shape (where the cloud tower is being pulled apart at the top), then a thunderstorm is on the way.  Right now, there is no discernable shape to the cloud, which is lightish grey but so widely dispersed across the sky that although I can hear the drone of an aircraft overhead, I can\u0027t see it and nor can I tell whether it has left one of those lingering condensation trails which Wohlleben says act as \u0026ldquoearly harbingers, of bad weather since if they don\u0027t dissolve, \u0026ldquothat means humidity is on its way, and with it a low-pressure area. The sky will soon cloud over.  Clearly, we have passed that milepost so I lower my gaze and look around for earthly omens. With no cattle around, I can\u0027t test the old trope about cows lying down before a cloudburst (which is nonsense anyway, according to the Met Office, even if 61 per cent of us believe in it), so I look for botanical soothsayers in the form of daisies. \u0026ldquoOne glance at the white and yellow flowers is enough to tell if you should hang your laundry out, writes Wohlleben. \u0026ldquoIf rain is on the way, or a storm, the petals close up. Some also droop downwards, to avoid letting a single drop in.  Evidently, the daisies in this Glasgow park are rebellious little flowers, for despite the fact that the sky has darkened and I can actually hear the rumble of distant thunder, their petals are defiantly open. So I search instead for some dandelions, having heard that the seeding heads shut up like umbrellas when bad weather is approaching. And Eureka! I find a clump of elderly dandelions with one fully formed clock and three of those feathery heads, all tightly furled like little green and white brollies.  And now I close my eyes and listen for the sound of silence. We all know calm is supposed to precede a storm, and it\u0027s generally thought that birds go quiet beforehand. And if evidence for this is hard to come by, they are known to be extremely sensitive to small changes in atmospheric pressure and to time their migratory flights accordingly. A 2014 study by the University of California found that golden-winged warblers took a substantial detour from their usual migration route to avoid ferocious tornadoes which killed 35 people.  Our feathered friends feature prominently in weather lore. \u0026ldquoHawks flying high means a clear sky, runs the old rhyme. \u0026ldquoWhen they fly low, prepare for a blow. Seabirds flying inland and solo-flying crows are also supposed to presage foul weather, while birds singing in the rain reputedly do so before a change for the better.  More pertinently for today\u0027s purposes, low-flying swallows are meant to warn us that storms are approaching but Wohlleben casts doubt on this theory, arguing that \u0026ldquoif anything, it\u0027s the other way around: as the wind picks up before a storm, swallows are likely to fly higher than usual. The saying \u0027when swallows fly high, the weather will be dry\u0027 could well lead you astray.  He says chaffinches are better barometers, apparently modifying their song when the weather is set to turn. When the sun is shining, he writes,\u0026ldquothe males usually trill a melody that sounds a little like \u0027chi-chip-chirichirichiri-chip-cheweeoo\u0027. If storm clouds loom or rain falls, however, he switches to a monosyllabic \u0027raaatch\u0027.  Sadly, I couldn\u0027t tell a chaffinch\u0027s cry from a sparrow\u0027s, which is probably symptomatic of how detached I am from the natural signals with which my great-great-great-etc-grandmother would have been intimately familiar. The Weather Detective contains fascinating, if depressing, insights into the way our urban lifestyles are shattering our ties with nature \u0026ndash not least through light pollution, which is obliterating the nocturnal star-shows that once guided our ancestors\u0027 footsteps. Meanwhile, moths, which mistake artificial lights for the moon by which they orientate their flight paths, find themselves hopelessly circumnavigating those electrical orbs until they die of exhaustion. (Bats, apparently, have learned to profit from their confusion, by patrolling street lights on warm summer nights, where they feast on disorientated moths.)  Here in the park, it\u0027s still broad daylight and in fact, the clouds have lightened to a greyish white. The thunder appears to have passed overhead and only a few splashes of rain have fallen. Perhaps those daisies were better informed than the dandelions after all. And indeed even my troubled bones \u0026ndash or rather, the headache that\u0027s been nagging since morning \u0026ndash has miraculously cleared with the storm clouds.  For as Wohlleben confirms, your granny is not necessarily havering about the rheumatic twinges or other physical symptoms that supposedly presage a change in the weather, since humans \u0026ndash like other animals \u0026ndash are hardwired to detect the shifts in air pressure that determine meteorological variations. Why some people are more sensitive than others to their inbuilt barometer is unclear, though Wohlleben surmises that it could be linked to changes in the conductivity of our cell membranes, which can become more sensitive as a result of certain medical conditions.  Whatever the cause, in the days before central heating and ready-meals, paying attention to those physiological indicators, and to their surroundings, would have been second nature to our ancestors.  Today, we are increasingly alienated from the natural world. In 2005, American author Richard Louv coined the term \u0026ldquonature deficit disorder to describe the harm we are doing to our children by robbing them of the opportunity to run, play and climb trees in the great outdoors. Even the language of childhood is changing. In 2015, prominent authors such as Margaret Atwood and Michael Morpurgo expressed \u0026ldquoprofound alarm at the Oxford University Press\u0027s decision to drop words such as \u0026ldquobuttercup and \u0026ldquominnows from its children\u0027s dictionaries, in favour of terms such as \u0026ldquobroadband and \u0026ldquocut-and-paste.  So does Wohlleben want us to throw away our smartphones? Apparently not. \u0026ldquoI\u0027m not advocating a return to our roots or a rejection of modern life, he insists. \u0026ldquoWhat I\u0027m really interested in is reclaiming our sensitivity to nature and reawakening our powers of observation. When we use our senses at full capacity, we access the wealth of thrilling and calming experiences waiting for us just outside our back doors, in nature and in our gardens. He urges us to train our sense of hearing, by attending to nature\u0027s noises. \u0026ldquoFind out what your own favourite garden sound is: perhaps it\u0027s the song of a blackbird at dusk, the rustle of a hedgehog under a hedge or the brisk buzz of a bumblebee in the shrubs. There are so many amazing things to hear out there beyond the everyday tumult of cars and planes.  Here in this city park, the rumble of cars and planes remains audible through the trees but so does the chirrup of birds (which may or may not be chaffinches) and the rustle of something that just might be a hedgehog.  The storm clouds, meanwhile, have all but disappeared. And I\u0027m sure I can smell sunshine.  The Weather Detective: Rediscovering Nature\u0027s Signs by Peter Wohlleben is published by Rider, \u0026pound12.99  PREDICTING THE SEASONS  Does a bumper summer crop of nuts, berries and fruits mean a hard winter is coming? Not necessarily. \u0026ldquoSadly, we can\u0027t predict the future from a bountiful crop, writes Peter Wohlleben. \u0026ldquoAfter all, the fruit buds are produced the previous summer. If it indicates anything, an abundance of acorns and beechnuts in the forests suggests \u0026hellip a dry summer the previous year.  Can snowmen sense the coming of spring? Astonishingly, yes \u0026hellip though only in the sense that if you can manage to build one, it means the snow itself is of the right consistency to be rolled into balls. And since this happens when temperatures are comparatively mild, it could mean that a long, hard spell is coming to an end.  Do pine cones act as weather stations? Sort of. \u0026ldquoThey open up in sunny, dry weather making a big puffy cone, while in rainy weather they close up making the cone smaller and narrower, explains Wohlleben. \u0026ldquoHowever, since the change lags behind the weather \u0026hellip they are completely useless as a forecasting instrument.  HOW TO TELL THE TIME BY NATURE\u0027S CLOCK  You can set your watch by flowers, many of which open at different times of day. \u0026ldquoPumpkins and courgettes kick things off first by opening their flowers at 5 o\u0027clock in the morning, writes Peter Wohlleben in The Weather Detective. \u0026ldquoFrom 8am the marigolds spread out their petals and the daisies follow at 9.  Meanwhile, birdsong can help tell us the early morning time but only if your ears are attuned to the melodies of particular birds, since the various species vary their peak dawn chorus moment, in order to ensure their territorial and mating calls aren\u0027t drowned out by others.  On the RSPB\u0027s website, Jenny Shelton offers this evocative chronology of the UK\u0027s dawn chorus, which she says peaks in the half-hour before and after sunrise: \u0026ldquoRobins, blackbirds and song thrushes begin, then the wrens and warblers join in. Finally, come the chaffinches, goldfinches and sparrows. It\u0027s thought that, because this last group have smaller eyes, they need more light to find food.  WHY DOES MIDSUMMER\u0027S DAY FALL AT THE BEGINNING OF SUMMER?  On Midsummer\u0027s Day, June 21, the sun is at its peak in the sky. \u0026ldquoThe reason why summer only truly begins after this peak, writes Peter Wohlleben, \u0026ldquois that the sun needs several weeks to heat up the air. This means the temperature increase lags a little behind the sun\u0027s height in the sky, and the air temperature only reaches its maximum later in the season when the days are already getting shorter again."},{"url":null,"title":"Alex Salmond says he urged Ian Blackford to adopt more disruptive tactics ahead of SNP Commons walkout","story":"              ALEX Salmond says he was behind the SNP\u0027s dramatic mass walkout at Westminster.  SNP MPs stormed out of the Commons chamber earlier this week when Ian Blackford was kicked out by the speaker during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions amid protests that MPs had not been given enough time to consider over 50 amendments to the Brexit bill on devolution.  Salmond said he suggested the dramatic protest during a chat with Blackford, the SNP\u0027s Westminster leader.  The former First Minister said Blackford phoned him on the eve of the clash.  \u0026ldquoOne of the iron laws of parliamentary politics is that if you always play the Westminster game then you will always lose,\" Salmond told the Sunday Herald.  \"And the way to turn that round successfully is to target interventions at those occasions which mean so much to the Westminster establishment - PMQs, budgets, state openings etc, and then use their own procedures against them.  \"Certainly that was my advice to Ian Blackford when he phoned me last Tuesday night and I was delighted to see him carry it through.\"  Salmond said he was filming in Gibraltar for a TV programme about Brexit when Blackford sought his advice about taking on the Tories.  Writing in today\u0027s Sunday Herald, Blackford blasted the \"absolute scandal\" of what he said was a lack of debate on a \"power grab\".  After the transfer of powers from Brussels to Whitehall and Westminster, London will take charge of policy areas traditionally devolved to Holyrood.  The SNP has said that means completely demolishing the principle at the heart of the devolution settlement by giving Westminster the final say on many devolved policy areas.  The UK wants to retain control over 24 devolved areas, most related to agriculture, fisheries and the environment, for up to seven years.  Blackford said MPs had been given just 15 minutes to debate the measures in the EU Withdrawal Bill, and warned that the stand off was a \"defining moment when the UK Parliament chose to reject devolution\".  Blackford is to use a debate in Westminster tomorrow (Monday) to make the case for emergency legislation to halt the \"power grab\".  Salmond was famously thrown out of the Commons chamber in 1988 after he interrupted the then chancellor, Nigel Lawson, in mid-flow.  In a dramatic move, Salmond \u0026ndash who had been an MP for just a year \u0026ndash spoke out against the controversial poll tax, a flagship policy of the Thatcher government.  After barracking Lawson and becoming the first MP in history to break parliamentary convention by intervening during the Chancellor\u0026rsquos budget, Salmond was ordered to leave the Commons.  In a frank admission, Salmond said that some SNP MPs between 2015 and 2017 had been \"intent on winning the gold star for good attendance rather than independence\".  He suggested that the SNP\u0027s loss of 21 seats in the 2017 general election was partly due to it becoming too comfortable with the Westminster set up.  Salmond, who was one of the SNP\u0027s casualties last year, said the walkout was a return to a much more effective style of opposition by the party.  \"The challenge for the SNP is to keep up the momentum. Westminster is treating Scotland with contempt,\" he said.  \"Now they are receiving a taste of their own medicine.  \"If they want business as usual then they should get their mitts off the powers of the Scottish Parliament.  \"In my opinion the SNP fell into the Westminster trap after 2015 and then paid the price at the polls.  \"Too many of the current crop of MPs then seemed intent on winning the gold star for good attendance rather than independence. Now all that has changed and well done to them.  \"The people who send the SNP south expect their MPs to shake it up, not settle down.  In response, a UK Government spokesman said: \"The UK Government is proceeding entirely in line with devolution. Rather than manufacture grievance the SNP should be working with us to get best deal for people in Scotland as we leave the EU.  Scottish Tory MP John Lamont added: \u0026ldquoThis really demonstrates the utter immaturity of the SNP.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Digital currency Scotcoin holders to be given bonus if they transfer to new version of coin","story":"              HOLDERS of the digital currency Scotcoin will be given a bonus of four times their stake if they transfer, or \"migrate\", to a new version of the coin.

To encourage the present 4,000 holders of the currency (including Sunday Herald readers who took up a free offer 18 months ago) to migrate to the new coin they will be offered four new ones for each one they hold. \"We value each present coin at one pence, a hundred is a pound and so you\u0027ll get five pounds for your pound if you take up the offer.\"  That offer is likely to last six months but Low can\u0027t say when it will start \u0026ndash that will depend on when the new blockchain is finished, and he isn\u0027t putting a time on that. But he is confident that holders will make the switch. \"Why keep an old Russian bearer bond,\" is how he puts it, \"when you can have a dollar?\"  Another advantage of the new system is that people will be able to switch directly to and from the main established currencies, like sterling, the euro and the dollar. And it will take the volatility out of crypto-trading because scotcoin will be linked to the pound and not bitcoin, which has been highly volatile. So its value will rise or fall with sterling.  Low has also offered scotcoin\u0027s IP address to the Scottish Government which, if taken up, would make it the country\u0027s official digital currency. He described initial meetings about it as \"highly encouraging\".  As he told the Sunday Herald in the past: \u0026ldquoHere\u0027s me, a guy who makes money out of the system and I basically latched onto the currency issue, the single biggest thing which lost the referendum. An independent Scotland must have its own currency, for better or worse.\"  Low may seem an unlikely rebel against financial orthodoxy but the accountant and financial adviser has a starry track record. It was him who organised, on the ground, the shareholder uprising which removed the seemingly impregnable families who owned Celtic and ushered in Fergus McCann, the jaggy bunneted Scottish ex-pat from Canada, who transformed the football club.  When the new scotcoin is launched, Low and his partner Temple Melville will hold a stake worth, notionally, around \u0026pound950 million. But he doesn\u0027t intend to profit from it, all of it will go into what he calls a common wealth fund. \"It will be the polar opposite of a sovereign wealth fund because it will benefit the poor and the disadvantaged.\" Administered by a group of \"the great and the good\", the plan is to pay young people in scotcoin to do good works for the benefit of the community.  It\u0027s a kind of quantitive easing in reverse, contrary to the present system where \"the rich get richer and poorer get poorer, the poorer will get richer\". If under-25s are given, say, pounds1000 or pounds10,000 \"they can do with it what they want, save it or spend it and if they spend it then it benefits the economy\".  To spend it they need outlets, and not just the Arlington Bar, which Low owns. \"I\u0027m confident that the big companies will get involved so that the kid will be able to walk into Greggs or M\u0026ampS or any large retailer and buy what he or she wants using a card, just like now. It\u0027s coming. It\u0027s just a matter of time.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Henry McLeish says Brexit  quot power grab quot  makes indyref2 more likely","story":"              FORMER First Minister Henry McLeish said the clashes at Westminster over a Brexit \"power grab\" had revived the prospect of an early referendum on independence.  McLeish helped steer the Scotland Act, which created the Scottish Parliament, through the House of Commons when he was a minister in Tony Blair\u0027s government in the late 1990s.  However, McLeish said the devolution settlement was now \"unravelling before our eyes\".  McLeish, who was First Minister from 2000 to 2001, said it was a \"tragic step back for Scotland\".  He added that the measures opponents of the Tories have described as a \"power grab\" by Westminster from Scotland made a second referendum much more likely.  He said: \"It\u0027s a gift to the SNP.  \"There was little prospect of an independence referendum, but this may have brought the idea forward.  \"To have devolution unravelling before our eyes is a tragic step back for Scotland and it may shift people\u0027s views.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Why this chapter of history for Glasgow School of Art seems so particularly cruel and unfair","story":"              UNTIL Friday night it had seemed that the fire which ravaged Glasgow School of Art in 2014 would simply become another part of the institution\u0026rsquos illustrious history.  After the shock in May 2014, fears about the continued existence of the building subsided and it appeared that, by some miracle, it was salvageable. Rather than devastation, the tale was shaping up take its place in history is a miraculous escape. It would take more than that to break a building which held such passion and history within its walls.  It\u0026rsquos difficult to articulate the richness of that history, and its importance to Glasgow. The Mackintosh building cements the place of Charles Rennie Mackintosh into the fabric of the city. It sits among the buzz of the bustle, both soaking up the Glasgow culture and helping define it.  The building has occupied its place in the Glasgow landscape since 1899, when the first half of the project was completed. It was designed by Rennie Mackintosh, then a junior draughtsman at firm Honeyman and Keppie, which submitted the plans as part of an architectural competition.  The school itself, as an institution, was founded more than 50 years before, and had already gained a substantial reputation in the field. Before it settled in its new home in Renfrew Street, in the glory of Rennie Mackintosh\u0026rsquos design, it had enjoyed stints in the Merchant City\u0026rsquos Ingram Street and the McLellan Galleries.  The prestigious institution went on to hold a number of academic schools: the Mackintosh School of Architecture, the School of Design, the School of Fine Art, the School of Simulation and Visualisation, and the Innovation School.  While maintaining its reputation as a revered place of study and continuing to appeal to international students as well as local, the School of Art, and in particular the Mackintosh building, has been popular with tourists as a place of historical and cultural significance.  Its relevance to modern art as well as history is undisputed. The School has been host to numerous winners and nominees of the Turner Prize in recent times, such as Richard Wright, Simon Starling and Martin Boyce.  Indeed, it boasts a strong roster of alumni. As well as its most famous son, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Glasgow School of Art has also counted artist Peter Howson, Travis singer Fran Healy, author Alasdair Gray, former Doctor Who Peter Capaldi, former Scots Makar Liz Lochhead and broadcaster Muriel Gray among its students.  While Rennie Mackintosh is celebrated in the modern age and he has secured his place in the history of art and architecture, he wasn\u0026rsquot always appreciated in his time. Despite his unexpected success with the Art School design, he struggled to get other major commissions in his time. The Glasgow School of Art is the most emphatic physical expression of his contribution to cultural history, and the building therefore represents something bigger for Scotland than just as a hub of rich art and cultural nurturing.  For the city of Glasgow, it hurts. Locals have dealt with several tragedies in recent years. While there is relief at the lack of any casualties as a result of the fire, the same could not be said for the disasters in 2013, when a police helicopter crashed into the roof of the Clutha Bar, and at Christmas 2014, when a number of people were killed in the bin lorry tragedy in the centre of town.  The first fire at the School of Art almost became a ray of light after the initial shock and sadness had calmed. For once it seemed the city may have caught a small break when it became clear that the School could be saved and restored. Now, the double blow feels like a knockout punch to the gut for a city looking forward to a grand re-opening of the Mackintosh building next year. And if it hadn\u0026rsquot already seemed like the planets had for some reason aligned to seal the famous building\u0026rsquos fate, the added salt in the wound is that the second fire happened on the School\u0026rsquos graduation day.  Perhaps one of the most difficult things to consider when thinking, when writing, about events since Friday night is accepting that we now may be discussing the Mackintosh building as something that once existed. It is not the chapter of history anyone could have imagined. It feels cruel and unfair. It\u0026rsquos hard to imagine it as something that was, but that no longer is. Glasgow will, of course, recover, and the School\u0026rsquos admirable reputation will continue. For now, however, the city needs a moment to mourn. Then, the questions, and anger, will inevitably come."},{"url":null,"title":"Beaumont sets British record on penny farthing","story":"              ENDURANCE cyclist Mark Beaumont has set a British record for the furthest distance travelled on a penny farthing in an hour.

She knew better than to get excited \u0026ndash it was simply a detailed drawing of his foot so she could tailor him the perfect sock. Ever the logician, this selfish gesture made perfect sense to Albert. He had feet and a wife who could sew. Socks or mc2, both are simply conclusions to cold calculations.  Perhaps Einstein had simply outgrown his brain\u0026rsquos empathetic static, that hunger for emotional reciprocation gifted to us by evolution to maintain social order. Despite his saintly posthumous persona, there is clear evidence that paints the young Einstein as a chap whose much-vaunted \u0026ldquohumanity was actually a wildly prejudiced, dispassionate study in societal anthropology.  Certainly, a dark disdain for his fellow man has been revealed in private diaries which finally went on public view this week.  Penned in the 20s, these jottings mainly detail the physicist\u0026rsquos tour of Asia and his highly questionable attitudes towards folk he observed on his travels. In particular, the Chinese. A great bunch of lads, according to Father Ted. Einstein disagreed. Like Ted, he preferred to group individuals as a collective and branded the entire Chinese population \u0026ndash 400 million at the time \u0026ndash \u0026ldquopeculiar, herd-like \u0026hellip often more like automatons than people. And, typical of Einstein, he was thinking of the future when he signed off with the zinger: \u0026ldquoIt would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. The Bernard Manning of physics had spoken.  A spectacular level of conceit is also evident in a lame yet rather lyrical piece of \u0026ldquoothering which conveyed Einstein\u0026rsquos distaste for Chinese women. Unlike his foot sketch this critique was, assumedly, an attempt at humour \u0026ndash yet its laboured structure suggests a sentence squeezed out by the bowels of the mind as some sort of dirty protest against decency. Einstein wrote: \u0026ldquo... how little difference there is between (the) men and women. I don\u0026rsquot understand what kind of fatal attraction Chinese women possess which enthrals the corresponding men to such an extent that they are incapable of defending themselves against the formidable blessing of offspring. A simple \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquot fancy yours much would have done, Albert. He certainly wouldn\u0026rsquot have been a fan of xhamster.  The irony of having expressed such abhorrent views on racial superiority was likely not lost on Einstein when he was forced to flee Germany 10 years later. Dehumanising Nazi propaganda, echoing his own musings on Chinese inferiority, had stoked anti-semitic fervour to fever pitch in his homeland. Einstein was forced to face himself in the mirror and see the real-world consequences of casual stereotypes and generalisations when used as weapons by politicians.  And as his star rose and influence grew in America, a newfound devotion towards civil rights and race relations made it clear that this great teacher of the universe\u0026rsquos secrets had learned a powerful lesson of his own in humility.  THE FUTURE IS IN CHINA\u0027S HANDS  IT\u0026rsquoS especially ironic that the most forward-thinking of modern physicists chose China as his target for blinkered offloading of the id. Shame on the young Einstein if he was already aware that no civilisation on Earth has enjoyed a longer continuous tradition of astronomy and science than the Chinese.  Around 1500BC, China\u0026rsquos stargazers inprinted detailed depictions of complex cosmic events on to shells and bones \u0026ndash with one of these fascinating relics being the earliest known record of a solar eclipse.  The Chinese are far from done with their 4,000-year quest to unlock the secrets of the universe. In fact, they\u0026rsquore just getting started \u0026ndash having recently spent billions to build the Jehovah\u0026rsquos dinner plate of satellites \u0026ndash Earth\u0026rsquos largest-ever communication structure. It was created with the single objective of discovering signals from alien civilisations.  A government splurging so much of its new-found wealth on alien hunting may seem a frivolous waste of cash, especially one with appalling levels of socio-economic hardship, but a newly-revived China views such expenditure as an investment in the future.  Above all their myriad Earthly geopolitical ambitions, what China truly desires is \u0026ldquofirst contact. Keen to solidify their superpower status in the eyes of the world, they\u0026rsquore too late to put the first man in space (Russia) or on the moon (Kubrick. Kidding, USA) so they have turned their focus on something even more seismic and culturally significant.  Of course, the Chinese also want extra-terrestrials to view them as Earth\u0026rsquos dominant nation \u0026ndash but whether aliens will recognise lines on maps as a viable way to draw distinctions between this lukewarm rock\u0026rsquos self-destructive, territorial hate machines is another matter.  Chinese ambitions don\u0026rsquot end at discovering extraterrestrial civilisations either \u0026ndash there are advanced plans for building an observatory on the dark side of the moon within the next few decades. They also quite fancy trumping the Americans by colonising Mars first too. Make no mistake, putting that first human foot on the red planet is presently the superpowers\u0026rsquo most highly contested prize, one desired beyond all other Earthly concerns.  Admirably, China has also raised a salutary two fingers towards the strain of xenophobic isolationism favoured by young Einstein, with plans to link up their alien-hunting satellite with countless other SETI projects across the planet. A vision of one big united skin condition itching Earth\u0026rsquos crust together to explore the great unknown \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a beautiful thing.  In fact, it\u0026rsquos the kind of progressive \u0026ldquostrength in numbers societal partnership that might one day save us all from being skinned alive by interstellar big game hunters from Zeta Reticuli that China inadvertently alert to our presence.  HARDWIRED FOR PREJUDICE  THE more hysterical media reports covering Einstein\u0026rsquos racist indiscretions were predictably light on the physicist\u0026rsquos attempts to confront the issue of civil rights in his adopted home of America \u0026ndash a lifelong crusade perhaps born of a desire to make amends for his rather prejudiced views as a younger man.  Yet, it\u0026rsquos not so easy to brush off Einstein\u0026rsquos mindset as simply a naive reflection of the prevailing attitudes of the era. Racism isn\u0026rsquot quite so clear-cut \u0026ndash one day, the dissonant turbulence left in the wake of a Trump presidency, Brexit and rise of the far-right across the globe will likely rank high among humanity\u0026rsquos most dangerously xenophobic eras \u0026ndash depressingly arriving just half a century after the Jewish holocaust.  Although humanity toils under the illusion of forward progress, human cultural norms and societal attitudes \u0026ndash as Einstein discovered with light \u0026ndash don\u0026rsquot always travel in a straight line.  Our perceptions of reality swim in a continual state of flux, adapting by expanding and contracting to fit the sociological, cultural and economical climate of the era. Evolution has evidently built our brains to be vulnerable to societal herdthink, and we only have to open our eyes to see our willingness to fall in line with hive mentality.  Prejudice certainly sharpens the hazy chaos of internal dialogue to a sharp point, giving the meaninglessness meaning and reinforcing the heady delusion of racial superiority. Reciprocated antipathy releases a highly addictive brain chemical cocktail of dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins.  Territorialism is seriously addictive \u0026ndash quite likely a hardwired evolutionary hangover. Yet ironically, many individuals only feel that they truly exist when becoming anonymous in the echo chamber \u0026ndash with the hive validating their infected mindset.  Einstein\u0026rsquos own addiction to the rush of personal prejudice was clearly still evident during the twilight of his career, having mutated from blinkered racism to a stubborn refusal to accept new scientific ideas \u0026ndash most famously his denial of the reality of quantum physics.  It led to wasted decades of dead-end research, with Einstein himself acknowledging the relative uneventfulness of his post-fame career.  A fruitless search to find a unifying theory to marry the world of the very small with Newtonian physics once again showed that even genius is not invulner-able to that opiate of the human condition \u0026ndash the rose-tinted comfort of our own long-calcified mindsets.  As Einstein himself said: \u0026ldquoBrief is this existence, a fleeting visit in a strange house. The path to be pursued is poorly lit by a flickering consciousness."},{"url":null,"title":"Plans to increase weeks off work for paternity leave would help 17 000 families in Scotland","story":"              Around 17,000 families in Scotland would benefit from an increase in paternity pay and leave, according to Labour.

When asked what message she had for Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson after he was recorded expressing concern the UK could end up remaining in orbit around the EU and not fully free to make trade deals, Mrs May said: \"The message is Government has agreed that we will have an independent trade policy. We will be free to negotiate those trade deals around the rest of the world.\"  She explained how in the week beginning July 9 the UK Government would publish a White Paper on Brexit, setting out in more detail its ambition for a future relationship with the EU.  The PM told BBC1\u0027s The Andrew Marr Show that she could not agree to any EU move that would harm the Union of the United Kingdom by creating a trade border between Britain and Northern Ireland, declaring: \"That\u0027s not right. That\u0027s not acceptable.\"  Ahead of a debate in the House of Lords tomorrow on the EU Withdrawal Bill and a crunch, potentially knife-edge vote on Wednesday when the amended legislation returns to the Commons, Mrs May insisted she was a woman of her word after some Tory rebels expressed fears they were not getting the compromise deal they believed had been on offer over Parliament having a greater influence on Brexit.  \"I did indeed meet a group of my fellow MPs. I listened to their concerns and I undertook to consider their concerns. And the next day I stood up in Prime Minister\u0027s Questions and said I\u0027d put an amendment down in the House of Lords. I\u0027ve done exactly that.  Facing claims of betrayal by some pro-EU colleagues, Mrs May insisted that she and her Cabinet colleagues recognised the concerns some people had about the role of Parliament in the Brexit process but she made clear she would not budge on the primacy of Government in the talks with Brussels, saying: \"Parliament cannot tie the hands of Government in negotiations.\"  However, her Tory colleagues Dominic Grieve made it clear the Conservative rebels did not intend to back down on getting Parliament more say on Brexit.

And I can assure you I wake up at 2am in a cold sweat thinking about the problems that we have put on our shoulders. The difficulty is that the Brexit process is inherently risky.\"  Robert Buckland, the Solicitor General, insisted UK ministers intended to press on with their own meaningful vote amendment, which suggested a Government motion on the final deal could not be amended rebels believe this means the meaningful vote would, therefore, not be meaningful.  Mr Buckland stressed that while Tory rebels argued the vote they wanted would only be advisory, he stressed that even this vote could have a political consequence and send a signal to Brussels that the UK Government was not in control of its own negotiating strategy. \u0026ldquoThere is a political contest to all of this, he insisted.  Ahead of the Lords debate tomorrow, Lord Newby, who leads the Liberal Democrats in the upper chamber, accused Mrs May\u0026rsquos plans on the Brexit bill as \u0026ldquobreathtaking in their arrogance and deceit.  \u0026ldquoHaving reneged on a promise made to her own colleagues, it is clear she cannot be trusted.

His response came after Theresa May appeared taken aback as to why she had allowed Sir Christopher Chope, who has sought to block a number of bills over the years, to receive a knighthood just a few months ago.  The MP for Christchurch in Dorset sparked outrage when, to cries of \u0026ldquoshame in the Commons, he single-handedly blocked the criminalisation of upskirting in England and Wales it has been banned in Scotland since 2009.  After the outcry, Sir Christopher told his local newspaper he supported outlawing what he called was the \"vulgar, humiliating and unacceptable\" act of upskirting but stressed he had objected on a point of principle about Government misusing parliamentary procedure.  He shouted down Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse\u0027s Voyeurism Offences Bill, which would have made illegal what the Prime Minister branded an \"invasive\" and \"degrading\" act she has pledged to revive an attempt to ban it.  The 71-year-old backbencher told the Daily Echo on Sunday: \"I feel a bit sore about being scapegoated over this. The suggestion that I am some kind of pervert is a complete travesty of the truth. It\u0027s defamatory of my character and it\u0027s very depressing some of my colleagues have been perpetuating that in the past 48 hours.\"  Sir Christopher urged the Government to find the \"fastest, fairest and surest passage\" for a bill banning people from taking pictures up someone\u0027s clothing without their consent as he accused ministers of \"hijacking\" backbenchers\u0027 time with the Friday afternoon debate.  But Ms Hobhouse, the MP for Bath, demanded the Tory MP apologise, saying: \u0026ldquoBy objecting to the Bill, Christopher Chope let women in England and Wales down.

Earlier, Culture Minister Margot James said her Tory colleague had brought their party into disrepute while the Prime Minister expressed her \"disappointment\" at his move.

Despite being ravaged by fire at the weekend, leading architectural conservationist, Professor Miles Glendinning, believes the Glasgow School of Art building can be completely restored - it is just a question of finding the money to do it.  Following the fire in 2014, Historic Environment Scotland worked with the school to draw up a digital record of the site using photographs and drawings, with exacting detail down to the nearest millimetre.  Professor Glendinning, director of the Scottish Centre for Conservation Studies, claims this \"astonishing\" record means that despite the damage being far worse this time round, the building is in a much better position for restoration.  Speaking to Good Morning Scotland, he argued that the structure was of such significance that it should be restored, despite the financial barriers.  \"In terms of conservation and restoration, we\u0027re funnily enough a lot better off this time because of a very remarkable recording project that GSA undertook after the last fire,\" he said.  \"The building still exists digitally, even if the inside is for the moment physically absent.  \"It\u0027s a digital recording and reconstruction of the whole building down to the nearest millimetre outside and in, using photos and measured drawings.  \"This is kind of a world first for Scotland and it means the start of the restoration work doesn\u0027t need to involve questions over whether it can be done at all.  \"However bad it looks now, the problem now is not about that, but about when and how it is to be paid for.\"  Professor Glendinning, who chairs architectural conservation at Edinburgh College of Art, said Scotland could look to other countries for examples of ruined buildings being brought back to life - including Germany where a church destroyed during World War II was rebuilt after 50 years.  Frauenkirche in Dresden was reduced to a pile of rubble but was reopened in 2005 after a 10-year restoration project.  Mr Glendinning said: \"As far as the physical damage is concerned, it does look very bad, but it\u0027s not as bad as some other cases we\u0027ve seen in recent history.  \"It\u0027s really a matter of how long it will take and where the money\u0027s going to come from.\"  He added that he would be \"very surprised\" if a decision was taken to demolish the building, saying he believes it is more likely that the existing walls will be reinforced.  \"It may look absolutely daunting at the moment, but there have been a lot of buildings worse than this that have been successfully restored - and they didn\u0027t have this digital record.\"  Fiona Hyslop, cabinet secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, said she has already been in touch with Historic Environment Scotland about the digitisation and has asked officials there to be involved in looking at possible options for the site.  Speaking on Sunday Politics, she said: \"I\u0027ve asked for Historic Environment Scotland, who have worked very closely with Glasgow School of Art over the last four years, to assess... what might be able to happen going forward.  \"They have world-leading digitisation.

It was then completely transformed to become Hubners Ice Skating Palace in 1885 and was one of the first buildings in Glasgow to have electricity.  It was here the first Scottish film \u0026lsquoThe Departure of the Columba from Rothesay Pier\u0026rsquo and Glasgow\u0026rsquos first public film was screened at The Skating Palace in 1896, which was commemorated by a plaque outside.

Films were also shown here regularly in the off-season.  In 1927, it reverted back to a dance hall, the Waldorf Palais, before the Associated British Cinema Chain (ABC) took it over.  Designed by architect Charles J McNair and seating a total of 2,359 people, the Regal opened in November 1929 as ABC\u0026rsquos flagship cinema in Glasgow.  A smaller auditorium, Scotland\u0026rsquos first post-war new cinema the ABC 2, was added in 1967, when the Regal was renamed ABC 1.  In 1979, the two cinemas were rebuilt as the five-screen ABC Film Centre, however all the screens were closed in 1999.  It was subsequently earmarked as Glasgow\u0026rsquos newest music venue with renovations beginning in 2002.  The ABC reopened its doors in 2005 with a concert from American pop-punk band Sum 41. It became the O2 ABC in 2009.  The fate of the iconic building now remains unknown after the Glasgow School of Art fire also engulfed the building.  The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service confirmed there had been \u0026ldquoextensive damage to the venue, with aerial images showing its roof caved in.  As of Sunday night, around 50 firefighters and six fire engines were still in attendance with \"dampening down operations\" ongoing throughout the day and into the evening.  In a statement on their website, O2 ABC bosses thanked the emergency services for \u0026ldquotheir rapid and effective action.  It said: \"As reported in the media, there has been a significant fire at The Glasgow School of Art Mackintosh Building on Friday 15 June 2018 that has affected adjoining buildings, including ours here at O2 ABC Glasgow on Sauchiehall Street.  The area was promptly evacuated as a precaution, everyone is safe, and there are no reported casualties from any nearby properties.  It then announced a number of cancellations over the weekend and said it would post updates regarding all forthcoming shows on the individual event pages of its website.  Many took to social media to pay tribute to the venue in the wake of the blaze.  ScottishCinemas.org, which archives pictures of cinemas across Scotland, said it was \"sad to see the severe damage\" to the venue.  Author and rapper Darren \u0026ldquoLoki McGarvey said: \u0026ldquoI hope the O2 ABC venue is not overlooked in the aftermath of this fire.  \u0026ldquoIt was a world class music venue, used by thousands of people every month.  \u0026ldquoAlso a great platform for local artists to get a shot on the big stage supporting international acts. A very special place.  Former Hue and Cry singer Pat Kane said the fire was a \"double hit\", adding \"both of them two of the most magical interiors I\u0026rsquove ever been in (the latter with so many triumphant @hueandcry nights).\"  US-based singer Beth Ditto, who performed at the venue last month, tweeted \"So sorry Glasgow, everyone at the school and the lovely staff at O2ABC\"  Singer Billy Bragg said the news about the Glasgow School of Art fire was \"heartbreaking\" before adding: \"Sorry to see that the O2 ABC was also badly damaged as I\u0026rsquove had some good gigs there. Hope the city doesn\u0026rsquot lose this important music venue.\"  A member of Scottish music duo Honeyblood sent a tweet that said: \"My heart is in absolute tatters. Not only the GSofA but O2ABC - a place that holds so many memories for me. Glasgow keep yer chin up.\"  Glasgow-based band Camera Obscura said: \"Absolutely gutted for everyone we know at the O2ABC. We\u0026rsquove played incredible shows there and it\u0026rsquos such a wonderful venue. Heartbroken for the GSofA.\"  The band Glasvegas said: \u0026ldquoGutted to hear about the fire at O2 ABC ... was just a month ago we had a very special night at Stag \u0026amp Dagger. I hope someone saved the disco ball.  Frightened Rabbit band members, who have recently suffered their own loss after the death of lead singer Scott Hutchison last monht, said: \"My heart is breaking reading about the Mackintosh building and the ABC.  \u0026ldquoThere aren\u0026rsquot enough words to describe the admiration for the ridiculously brave and heroic firefighters of Scotland who do this on a daily basis. Glasgow is hurting but will recover.  Gigs in Scotland, which helps promote and sell tickets for gigs, said: \u0026ldquoSending love to all of our colleagues at O2 ABC and of course to Glasgow School of Art. Two Glasgow institutions, both part of the creative backbone of our incredible city.  Still Game actor Gavin Mitchell described it as \u0026ldquoone of the best venues in Glasgow. \u0026ldquoIt now looks like we may have also lost the ABC. That beautiful wooden roof. One of my favourite and best venues in Glasgow.  \u0026ldquoSo many memories, from performing to seeing movies there when I was a kid. This is a truly horrible day for Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"Loss of the ABC a critical one for Glasgow and Scotland  39 s live music scene","story":"              IT was built in 1875, and opened as the Diorama, and for more than 130 years it has been a key venue, both for film and music, in the centre of Glasgow.  The loss of the ABC venue, since 2005 a music venue, is a particularly sore one for the Glasgow and Scottish music scene, which has seen several music venues close in recent years.  With a capacious main arena and an intimate second stage, the O2 ABC is one of the reasons that Glasgow was recently boasting about how it could \"unlock its potential\" as a city of music to rival Nashville or New Orleans.  It has a city centre location, an elegant Art Deco Facade, and, latterly, an enormous mirror ball in its main auditorium, and played host to cult bands, pop chart big hitters, rock, pop, dance and funk veterans, and all manner of Scottish talent in the last two decades.  The venue, perhaps an under rated or under-appreciated one, was one of the best in Scotland for its size and location.  The building\u0027s history is an eclectic one - it was at one stage a venue for ice skating, for a circus, then dancehall.  This writer\u0027s first memories of the venue are as a cinema - which it was from 1929 when the Associated British Cinema Chain (ABC) took it over, and called it the Regal.  After a major refurbishment in 2005 it became a major music venue, with more than 400 events staged in its halls annually.  Every year tens of thousands of eager gig goers ascended its (slightly cramped) stairs to the main arena, or utilised its long, old-fashioned bar that looked out onto the busy street below.  Its size was not cavernous, like the Armadillo or the Hydro, but could take sizeable crowds without losing too much an element of intimacy.  While not as iconic as the Barrowlands Ballroom, and not as atmospheric and intimate or sweaty as King Tut\u0027s, it was a key part of the city\u0027s music ecology - it has played host to Adele, Ed Sheeran, Chvrches, The Twilight Sad, Nils Frahm, Sam Smith, Bruno Mars, London Grammar, Royal Blood, Kasabian, Florence and the Machine, Gregory Porter and Bombay Bicycle Club, among many others.  The ABC also had regular club nights, also since 2005.  Its loss - as looks very likely - in the disastrous fire of the past weekend is an undoubted blow to the city\u0027s music scene.  Live music generates \u0026pound160m a year for the city and attracts 1.4 million fans to Glasgow.  Glasgow is an official Unesco City of Music, but a recent report said this title had not been utilised enough, being \"poorly used and largely unrecognised\" - this loss will not help.  The aerial photographs of the destroyed roof of the ABC, next to the burnt-out shell of the Glasgow School of Art, is a dismal one.  Music venues of the size and scale of the ABC are expensive to build, and there are few properties in the city centre that could take over its mantle as an accessible, sizeable, stage for music of all kinds."},{"url":null,"title":"pupils to benefit from new mentoring scheme","story":"\t\t\t\tMCR Pathways\u0026rsquo Young Scottish Talent initiative will be available to support disadvantaged and care-experienced pupils at St Machar, Banff, Inverurie, Fraserburgh and Peterhead Academies, as well as The Gordon Schools from August.                                                    The charity, which is being supported by The Wood Foundation as it expands its reach in the North-east, hopes to eventually be active in every City and Shire secondary school.                                                    The North-east is the first area for the nationwide expansion of the programme outside of Glasgow. Aberdeen has the second highest proportion of young people failing to move onto \u0026lsquopositive destinations\u0026rsquo when they leave school.        The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos UK Director Ali MacLachlan said: \u0026ldquoNurturing young people at this crossroads in their lives is vitally important in terms of supporting them to find the right path to fulfil their potential.\u0026ldquoPeople may be surprised to learn that the North-east has such high rates of young people unable to move onto positive destinations after school. We must harness the potential of these young people to support the current and future economic performance of our region.\u0026ldquoMany of these vulnerable young people lack the stability and support many of us take for granted. This imbalance is something the programme aims to address.\u0026ldquoMCR Pathways has already demonstrated significant impact and we are pleased to support its introduction to the North-east.                                                                                                        The Wood Foundation will be hosting an open event next week to inform potential mentors and business partners about the programme.A mentor meets a young person weekly in their school. They provide a listening ear and supportive voice \u0026ndash a constant adult role model who will build confidence, aspirations and a route to meaningful training or employment. Mentors are trained to guide young people through subject choices, training and professional routes to broaden their mind-sets and realise their potential.One of the opportunities, which requires support from the local business community, is \u0026lsquoTalent Tasters\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash a bite-sized work experience programme showing young people different aspects of industry.Iain MacRitchie of MCR Pathways said: \u0026ldquoA young person\u0026rsquos future should be determined by their potential, never their circumstances. Our mentoring scheme levels the playing field and gives young people structured, enthusiastic and dedicated support to really find a way to realise and achieve their goals as they make that transition from childhood to their adult lives.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoWe are very proud of what the programme and our young people have achieved to date and we have no doubt the same successes will be realised in the North-east where we have recognised a real need and desire for this support.\u0026lsquoPathways Coordinators\u0026rsquo have been hired for each of the six schools and will begin work after the summer break. They support pupils in S1 and 2 and match them with a mentor from S3.MCR Pathways is already operational across all Glasgow secondary schools where more than 1300 young people are supported each week through a mixture of group work, mentoring and work-based \u0026lsquoTalent Taster\u0026rsquo opportunities. More than 80% of mentored participants have moved onto further education, higher education or employment in sharp contrast to the national figure of 54%.Businessman Iain MacRitchie launched the charity in 2007 after being shocked by a professional experience restructuring a youth care business. While the business health was restored, the poor outcomes for young people remained the same and he realised the need for relationship-based, meaningful support.He commented: \u0026ldquoThat professional experience was a real eye-opener for me, seeing that these young people were not getting the support they needed and nowhere near achieving their potential. I vowed then to do something and have taken time out from my business to make a difference. This programme really does deliver profound results for some of the most vulnerable in our society.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoHelping a young person onto the right path at this stage really is life-changing. We continuously hear incredible stories including a mentee who went from a homeless unit to medical school and another who had to contend with family addiction issues and was four years behind in their education to graduating university and becoming a building surveyor.\u0026ldquoTheir stories, among countless other, have spurred us to roll out this project nationwide and we look forward to hearing of the successes of North-east youngsters in the years to come.The first information event for individuals and businesses keen to support the programme in the North-east will be held at The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos office in Aberdeen on Monday, June 18.To register, or for more information on future events, please contact Alison.maclachlan@thewoodfoundation.org.uk.

Few local high street businesses remain in Tain, Mr Stone\u0026rsquos home town.\u0026ldquoThe presence of these empty and increasingly derelict properties undermines one of the most important industries of the Highlands \u0026ndash namely tourism, he says.\u0026ldquoI would therefore suggest that properly tackling this problem should now be one of the most urgent issues for both the UK and Scottish governments.\u0026ldquoThis problem can no longer be ducked by plans that turn out to be more about words than actions \u0026ndash or, worse still, by means of the argument that the decline in the UK\u0026rsquos high street retail sector is inevitable.\u0026ldquoIf we really value our communities and their built heritage, then we must use every means at our disposal \u0026ndash grants, infrastructure investment, tax breaks, local and national planning \u0026ndash so that we can find new ways of bringing these buildings back into sustainable use.Speaking yesterday, Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt pains me greatly to see what is happening, and also to witness nothing better than fine words and hand-wringing when it comes to tackling the problem.\u0026ldquoThis letter is my first move in a campaign that I am going to pursue with the greatest vigour. Tain is my home town and I care about it \u0026ndash and the same is true of the other communities that I have the honour to represent.Monday 18 Jun 2018 9:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04114000/04114264.jpg","title":"Special delivery for retiring Lybster postie","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe started in 1988, taking over from another postie who was a familiar figure to a certain generation, Donnie Bremner from Mid-Clyth.Thirty years ago Murray had to go over the Ord to Helmsdale to meet the train north to collect the mail then take it to the local sorting offices in Dunbeath and Lybster. All the small local post offices and all the postboxes between Berriedale and Lybster had to have the mail uplifted on this run.Now two trucks each morning bring the mail north from Inverness and Murray has been working mainly, since these changes, on the rural run through Occumster, Roster, Clyth, Bruan and Ulbster.Murray frequently found himself stuck in snow in past winters and has been rescued by farmers pulling him out of drifts in the rural hinterland of south-east Caithness.He served under three postmasters in Lybster \u0026ndash firstly as a part-time postie as well as being a fisherman under the late Hugh Gunn, whose father before him had been the Lybster postmaster. After Hugh retired, Des and the late Mary Somerville took over before handing over to the present incumbent, Duncan Winfield, and wife Gail.One incident in particular has stayed with Murray and harks back to his early days on his rounds. When arriving at the late Annie Bain\u0026rsquos place on the Smerlie road he was implored to catch a ewe that had got loose.Murray jumped the fence and caught it as Annie almost simultaneously thrust her arm up its rear to pull out a new lamb and straight back in for another.After a quick wipe down of the livestock he was then asked if there was anything in the post, almost as if nothing had happened in the previous five minutes. Murray duly delivered Annie\u0026rsquos mail having firstly helped with the other delivery, and on to his next stop.A collection was taken in Lybster Post Office and the money was handed over by local postmaster Duncan Winfield accompanied by wife Gail in a small ceremony on June 6.Monday 18 Jun 2018 9:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04109000/04109865.jpg","title":"Wick museum set for another busy year","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIan Leith, chairman of the Wick Society, made the plea after being re-elected to the post at the annual general meeting on Thursday night.\u0026ldquoIn the open season last year we had in excess of 5000 people, which was a good bit up on previous years, and this year looks as though it\u0026rsquos heading very much the same way, Mr Leith said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos busy, with a lot of tourists coming in. We\u0026rsquore getting a lot of Australians in at the moment.\u0026ldquoOne thing we would like to get more of is local people. It\u0026rsquos great that we get these visitors from all over the world, and many of them have Caithness connections and they come on that basis, but it would be nice to get more local people.\u0026ldquoOur open day on January 2 was a good start in that respect because it opened the door to people from the local area to come and see what we have.\u0026ldquoA number have come back on the basis of that.\u0026ldquoThe local people are very supportive of the Wick Society. Everything in this museum is donated by people who either live locally or have connections with this place.\u0026ldquoI mentioned at the AGM about the amount of donations that we get in monetary terms. That\u0026rsquos considerable, from local businesses and local people. Some of those are also in-kind donations, certainly in terms of the boat section \u0026ndash they get quite a lot of in-kind help from businesses around the harbour.\u0026ldquoSo, while we would like more local people to come in through our doors and appreciate what we\u0026rsquove got here, it\u0026rsquos not a criticism of the local people because they are very, very supportive.He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos an honour to be part of the Wick Society and to be part of its development.\u0026ldquoWe have a number of plans in place for things we want to do.

I\u0026rsquom sure there are a lot of people who won\u0026rsquot know them.He explained that only the base of the memorial, which was erected in 1903, was still to be refurbished with the interpretation panels set to complete the whole project.The path along by the memorial is on the Wick section of the John O\u0026rsquoGroats Trail, a 147-mile route from Inverness.Mr Bogle pointed out that interpretation panels were already in place on the stretch of the trail through Wick, with one at the Trinkie. However, two existing panels are being moved to the Braehead and North Head.He said the paths were already proving popular with local people and visitors and the group is keen to provide information about the area.Mr Bogle added that the civil engineer\u0026rsquos gravestone \u0026ndash in the graveyard of Wick St Fergus Church \u0026ndash had also been tidied up recently.Wick Harbour Authority chairman Willie Watt MBE said: \u0026ldquoFor me James Bremner is one of the unsung heroes of Caithness. He is just an amazing character. Nothing was too difficult for him and he treated everybody he worked with the greatest of respect. He was a great leader and motivator.Mr Watt pointed out that one of the Wick engineer\u0026rsquos greatest achievements was the refloating of the SS Great Britain \u0026ndash the largest ship of its time \u0026ndash when she ran aground off Ireland in the 1840s.He said that Mr Bremner was sent for from Wick, along with a few of his men, when other engineers had failed in one of the biggest salvage operations of that era.James Bremner (1784-1856) was born at Stain, Keiss. He was an apprentice in a Greenock shipyard and returned to Wick to establish his own shipbuilding business, constructing over 50 vessels in as many years as well as designing and building many harbours. He was involved in the construction of the breakwater at Wick harbour.A local author, John Mowat, once described Mr Bremner as \u0026ldquothe Ulysses of the north and \u0026ldquoour greatest Caithnessian.Mr Bremner is still remembered in Keiss with a plaque at the harbour erected by the Institution of Civil Engineers.Monday 18 Jun 2018 9:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
