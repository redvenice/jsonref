According to the court docket Mel then filed an anti-SLAPP motion which was denied. It\u0027s unclear when the expected ten-day trial will take place, although it had been scheduled for July 23 before an appeal was lodged. Mel has claimed that Gilles was having an affair with her then husband but Gilles launched the defamation case saying that while she did have sex with Belafonte and had an abortion, her main lover was in fact Mel. Gilles claims in legal docs that Mel seduced her when she was aged just 18 and they had a seven-year sexual relationship. Mel has hit back saying Stephen paid the nanny \u0027in excess\u0027 of $300,000 over three years for her work.

She added that her \u0027sexual and employment relationship with Brown continued for approximately seven years.\u0027 She also says she \u0027personally witnessed both Brown and Belafonte bring different women into their home and engage in group sex on multiple occasions.\u0027 Gilles also says she became pregnant as a result of a one-night stand with another man, not from having sex with Belafonte, and she did have an abortion. She claims to have confided this with Mel and that Mel helped arrange for her to have the abortion and care for her afterwards. Gilles is seeking unspecified damages and is suing for libel, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/14/03/4E38B4FE00000578-0-The_former_Spice_Girl_was_seen_arriving_at_a_Los_Angeles_court_o-a-7_1531536285431.jpg","title":"Mel B ex Stephen Belafonte spend FOUR HOURS locked inside LA coutroom","story":"Stephen Belfaonte (left) and ex-wife Mel B (right) spent almost four hours together Friday locked in a Los Angeles courtroom - but still couldn’t make peace to end their bitter post orce battles over money and children          The former Spice Girl was seen arriving at a Los Angeles court on Friday for a hearing concerning her daughter Despite their marathon session - which Judge Juhas closed to the public - the warring couple couldn’t reach agreement on the step visitation, nor on other mostly financial issues they are bickering about.And Judge Juhas postponed their case until Monday, telling DailyMail.com, ‘There is no settlement yet.’When Mel took a cigarette break during her half day in court, DailyMail.com asked her what was happening in the closed-door proceedings, the exasperated America’s Got Talent star replied: ‘Nothing - nothing’s happening in there.’EXCLUSIVE: Mel B WILL face a jury trial in defamation suit...Billy Bush\u0027s wife Sydney Davis files for orce after...Share this articleBelafonte, also 43 - who wore his trademark gray suit in court - and Mel were orced last December after a bitter nine-month battle in which lurid tales of kinky sex, drug and alcohol abuse and allegations of domestic violence made headlines.Despite their orce being final more than six months ago, trying to settle complicated issues between them over children and money has dragged on through this summer, with Mel estimating that she’s now spent more than $1 million in legal fees and owes another $800,000 to attorneys and accountants.Mel - who has a six-year-old daughter, Madison with Belafonte - claims the long-drawn-out split with him has ruined her financially, she’s more than $3 million in the red and the IRS has started garnishing her America’s Got Talent salary to pay off hundreds of thousand of dollars in back taxes she owes.

In 2016, Barclays scrapped £8 billion of Lobo loans by converting them to fixed-rate loans, at a cost of £182 million to the bank.Barclays board row over possible £61bn merger with rival...Barclays fraud case kicked out: Blow for the Serious Fraud...Share this articleThe councils’ claim form accuses the bank of ‘deceit andor fraudulent misrepresentation’ as its bankers were secretly rigging Libor, which was ‘integral’ to the rate at which Lobo loans had to be paid back.Many local authorities took out the loans as they appeared to promise lower interest rates than those offered by central government. But the loans remain highly contentious as they gave banks the power to impose new rates at certain points. Borrowers could reject the new terms, but would then be forced to repay the entire loan straight away.Barclays and the local authorities declined to comment. But Lianne Craig, a partner at law firm Hausfeld, which is representing the councils, confirmed it had issued a ‘protective claim’ in the High Court.A full claim is due to be filed in the coming months. In 2015, a parliamentary committee launched an investigation into Lobo loans.          Manchester is among the local authorities launching the action against BarclaysRob Carver, a former derivatives trader at Barclays, described the loans as ‘horrible stuff’, telling MPs: ‘I do not think anyone who fully understood it would do it.’Crippling repayment rates of 7 to 9 per cent were attached to some of the loans and are thought to have cost taxpayers tens of millions of pounds in interest a year.The 14 local authorities – Bristol, Bradford, Greater Manchester, Kirklees, Leeds, Liverpool, Newcastle, North East Lincolnshire, Nottingham, Oldham, Sheffield, South Gloucestershire, Walsall and West Yorkshire – launched the action. They are preparing to put a number to the total value of the claim if Barclays seeks to defend the action, rather than settle.The councils say the loans – entered into between 2004 and 2010 – should be rescinded with fees returned. They also want compensation for damages.On June 27, 2012, the Financial Services Authority, the precursor to the Financial Conduct Authority, fined Barclays £59.5 million over manipulation of Libor – the London interbank offered rate. Some Lobo loans were directly linked to Libor rates, and many others were influenced by it. In some cases, repayment rates rose if Libor rates fell out of a certain range.Joel Benjamin, of Debt Resistance UK, said: ‘It’s high time banks were made to pay to clean up their own mess.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/14/16/4E3D2B2900000578-0-image-m-5_1531583925313.jpg","title":"TANA RAMSAY explains exercise helps deal family trauma","story":"    Tana Ramsay, pictured, uses her daily run as an excuse to cry and screamThere is much for Tana Ramsay to be grateful for today. But the wife of sweary television chef Gordon Ramsay, now head of a £43 million restaurant empire, is not immune to shedding a few tears every now and again – indeed, she says, it’s a necessity.Running around Wimbledon Common in South-West London, as Tana does several times a week with the family’s two dogs, she allows herself to cry and occasionally, even, to scream. For the last couple of years have wreaked a heavy emotional toll.There was the devastating loss of their son, the couple’s fifth child, when Tana had a miscarriage at 21 weeks. Then, last year, a bust-up between Gordon and Tana’s father, Chris Hutcheson – who used to run Gordon Ramsay Holdings – ended at the Old Bailey, with the latter jailed for six months for hacking into Gordon’s emails.Earlier it was revealed that Chris had a secret second family, with grown-up children. ‘It’s easy to put a smile on and say, “Everything is absolutely fine!” ’ says Tana.‘But when you’re running, with your music on, you can cry. You can scream. That’s important. You can’t keep it in because it comes back to haunt you if you haven’t processed it. That’s what causes long-term problems.’DR MICHAEL MOSLEY: Keep your blood sugar in check... even if...The many reasons for buying a Georgian house... they\u0027ve got...Share this articleThere is no sign of this emotional turmoil today. Tana, 43, is glowing with good health. She reveals that her father, now 70, is out of jail and competed in his 90th marathon in April this year – alongside his grandchildren.So they’re all back in touch? ‘Oh yes, absolutely,’ Tana says. She won’t say more, but it’s evident that Chris is now very much part of the family again. Whether he and Gordon have patched up their differences is less clear.And Tana, like her father, is arguably in the best shape of her life. She runs marathons, has completed a half-ironman, and is currently training for the London Triathlon to raise money for the couple’s charity, the Gordon and Tana Ramsay Foundation, which has donated £850,000 to London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital since 2015.          Tana, pictured centre with husband Gordon, right, and from left son Jack, family friend Alexander Dundas, and daughters Holly and MatildaIt is exercise, more than anything, which has helped the family cope with the tribulations of the past two years.‘What it does is allow you to process things,’ she says.‘Whether it is cycling and chatting together, or running and having a cry on your own, you have to have that release. You also have to have those moments where you allow yourself to feel really sad, when you’re thinking, “Why me?” We’re all going to think like that occasionally. It means we can handle it. It has drawn us together as a family.‘It’s also important to talk with the children and not just think everything is fine. Gordon’s a really big one for talking. Sometimes I just say to him “Seriously?”, and he’s like: “No, we have to talk about it.” Sometimes that’s irritating.’          The Ramsay\u0027s pictured here with Victoria Beckham, centre, are an incredibly sporty familySport runs through almost everything the Ramsay family does. The couple’s four children – Megan, 20, twins Jack and Holly, 18, and Tilly, 16 – compete variously in swimming, netball, rugby, ju-jitsu, hockey and water polo. Their schedule is frenetic: Tana shrugs at the idea that she’s a supermum, but it is impressively well-orchestrated.Jack can be dropped off at school in Dulwich, South-East London, by 6.30am, and Tilly and Holly to their school in Richmond by 7.30am, which leaves Tana time to have a run on Wimbledon Common with the dogs by 7.50am. She’s home by nine, showered and at work at her beauty salon in Battersea by 9.30am.There’s also a home gym – which the whole family uses – and gruelling three-hour cycle rides at the weekends. It’s precisely because the kids are so busy that you won’t see them falling out of nightclubs like other celebrity offspring.‘I don’t worry about the kids going off the rails because they have sport,’ she explains. ‘Yes, they’re teenagers and they’re all on Instagram doing those weird pouts. How could they not be?‘All I can do is make sure they have a healthy relationship between their body and food. Exercise is good not only to keep in shape but mentally it’s fantastic, and a great discipline for kids. Showing them we do it, and instilling that attitude in them, is so important. They’ve been studying for A-level and GCSE exams and I’ve said, “Do a couple of hours of exercise and your brains will work better.”‘I do think it’s helped them to deal with the stress.’Tana admits to following her children on the Find My Friends app, which allows users to see the location of others using GPS. It hasn’t always been reassuring.‘Jack went out after his exams,’ she says. ‘I woke up and it was 5am and he wasn’t home. I’d promised I wouldn’t call because he’s 18, so I went on the app and then saw he was at St Thomas’ Hospital so I freaked and rang him, but tried to sound relaxed. In fact, he was just getting in an Uber.’Tana has run nine marathons and Gordon has competed over a dozen. When Megan turned 18 – the minimum age to take part – she begged to be allowed to do it too. Jack and Holly competed for the first time this year, while Tilly, who has her own CBBC show, Matilda And The Ramsay Bunch, is ‘chomping at the bit’ to have her chance.GORDON, 51, naturally, has the best time (3.30) – ‘have you seen his thighs?’ – followed by Tana, a respectable 25 minutes behind. All of them except Tilly, who will be on a water polo tour, are taking part in the London Triathlon on August 4 to 5. Surely there must be competition? Tana laughs. ‘Between Jack and Gordon it can get pretty intense,’ she admits. ‘But Jack hasn’t beaten me at the marathon yet. They all make me incredibly proud, and I get very emotional.‘There’s so much pressure on them already with social media, so the more normal we keep it the easier it is as a family to just be us, and for them to have the confidence to be themselves.’Tana is clearly comfortable in her own skin, and felt no pressure to stay in shape as Gordon’s celebrity rose. They married in 1996 when he was head chef at Aubergine in Chelsea – now he has 35 restaurants across the globe and seven Michelin stars, along with TV projects in the UK and US.The couple count the Beckhams among their closest friends, so does Tana train with Victoria? ‘No, although when we’re in America we do go to Soul Cycle classes together. I’d love to get Victoria in an ironman competition.’ Tana looks mischievous. Would she do it? ‘No, I doubt it. She’d look at me like I was some kind of maniac, I imagine.’Tana obviously sees things differently – for Gordon and her, exercise is a release. The couple take long cycle rides together on Sundays, completing up to 60 miles a time over the Surrey hills as part of their triathlon training.‘We’ve always been good at spending time away from the kids, just the two of us. Finding something which helps you remember what you like in that person, after so many years of marriage, is great. Gordon might have been away all week in the US, but we’ll go out early in the morning and spend several hours on our bikes and catch up.‘For me, a mum in my 40s, it’s also about doing something just to feel good about myself. I’ve given the kids all of my attention for all of these years, so it’s time for me. I really enjoy it – it’s so social.’Food, perhaps unsurprisingly, is important in the Ramsay household but Tana insists they have ‘a good balance’. ‘I never obsessed over having perfect food for the kids at all times,’ she says. ‘I never watched over them at parties, never said, “Don’t eat this.” I didn’t want to be a helicopter mum, forever hovering over them.‘We’ll have chocolate in the fridge, but our meals are usually healthy. That’s how it should be.’They try to eat together as a family as much as possible but their conflicting schedules mean it happens ‘maybe once or twice a week’.Breakfast is ‘a slice of toast while running down the stairs’, she says. When asked if the children are talented cooks, she pauses before sniggering: ‘They do cook.’Refreshingly, too, there’s no special ‘training diet’ as she prepares for the triathlon. Tana has always run and once finished a 5km in a very good time of 19 minutes. The London Triathlon involves a 750m swim (‘longer than it sounds’, she jokes, grimly), then a 20km cycle ride followed by a 5km run.It’s for a great cause. The Gordon and Tana Ramsay Foundation, set up in 2014, has 235 competitors signed up to Team Ramsay, and money raised for Great Ormond Street has, in previous years, funded research projects and intensive-care equipment.Does she see herself doing it at 80? ‘My father has just had a hip replacement and has been on this health regime. He’s lost a stone in three weeks and ran his 90th marathon in April with three of his grandchildren and one of his sons. I’d like to aspire to that.‘At 80, I want to have energy, I want to be saying to Gordon, “Let’s go on holiday with our bikes and panniers, somewhere like Hawaii.”‘Enjoying our time after working so hard, just ambling around. That’s how I see us.’    Start in a low lunge, with one knee down and the other leg forwards. Then, engaging your core muscles, switch legs.

So, as the only British journalist invited to attend this year, would I discover one I could actually bear?COULD I GET MADONNA’S BOTTOM?The exhaustive list of almost 400 classes, workouts and evening activities at Idea World is overwhelming I commit to 25 classes over a period of 48 hours.Only the most sweat-inducing make my cut.After the Powells’ Extreme Transformation Workout, an endless series of muscle-toning exercises performed for three minutes at a time, I move on to a BOSU class: exercises practised aboard a squishy rubber dome.Instructor Alison demonstrates how to ‘paddle’ with my steel bar in hand, engaging the core and glutes for ‘bums and tums’ tightening.          Over the course of 48 hours, Eve tried out 20 different work outs at the Idea World fitness convention in San Diego, CaliforniaFinding my balance on the rubber sphere is tough enough let alone extending opposite arm and legs simultaneously. Remarkably, by focusing on a spot on the wall in front of me, I’m able to complete the rest of the routine with minimal wobbling.After Tae Bo, a mixture of martial arts and aerobics, comes Booty Barre – a class especially designed to build a beautiful bottom.The workout – whose fans include Madonna – draws on the principles of Pilates and ballet.As a regular Pilates goer, I was fairly confident I’d get through the hour with ease, but after five minutes of thrusting with a medicine ball between my legs – on tiptoes – I realise this isn’t the case.By the end of the class, my thighs are like jelly and I’m starving hungry. It’s 10am.BOOT CAMP, BOXING... AND BATTLE ROPESI decide to get the worst out the way before lunchtime: army boot camp.Developed by a former US sergeant, this is a 90-minute sweatathon involving jumping squats, lunges and sprints interspersed with military-style marches. Angry orders from Sergeant Ken Weichart (aka Sgt Ken) to ‘Embrace The Pain!’ keep me moving despite the agony but after 50 rapid squats and the sergeant’s demands to ‘get lower’, I succumb to the pain and embarrassingly stumble mid-rep. ‘No quitters here!’ Ken loudly reminds me.I manage a 30-minute lunch break before leaping straight into the on-site boxing ring for a couple of rounds with a bullish, bald-headed former champ.          This odd-looking device is supposed to provide a work out for bums and tumsTo my surprise, I can throw a mean punch and even manage a spin, kick and smack move.Then I move across to Battle Ropes. After 15 minutes of tutorial, we experiment with all 30 ways a 55 lb, 50ft rope can be moved about for a vigorous full-body workout.It’s not all about waving it with the hands – try jumping between two ropes for a quick warm-up, or lifting the ropes in between press-ups to work the core and arms. At the end of the class, I unashamedly collapse on the floor into a pool of my own sweat and admit defeat. Tomorrow is another day…TORTURE... FOR KILLER ABSOn day two, I explore the 500,000 square foot exhibition hall showcasing almost 400 cutting-edge fitness gadgets and machinery.I start with a demonstration of the latest vibrating Power Plate to hit US gyms. The machine stimulates muscles with vibration, increasing muscle tone when exercising. I expect to watch my love handles wiggle off my body without moving but unfortunately, some work is required. I try step-ups and single leg balances, before moving on to planks, bridges and seated crunches – all aboard the vibrating platform. Each exercise feels ten times more intense than I’d ever experienced before, with ripples of pain shooting through my entire body.Converts claim that those ten minutes of excruciating torture are the fastest route to killer abs.Other highlights of the exhibition include a 6ft stair-climbing machine which, on maximum resistance, feels five times harder than normal stairs a virtual-reality treadmill that sends me running through the French countryside and a cycling machine called Real Ryder which tilts 22 degrees and emits stimulating vibrations. I disembark the bike, feeling two stone lighter, and seek out an upper-body exercise to give my legs some well-earned rest.

There’s no stopping it. My friends and I have harvested two honeycombs from the beehive I’ve been keeping and now we’re in the kitchen of my two-up, two-down in Oxford, sieving it over a pan, straining the comb and mashing it with our spoons. The honey gloops and the smell is like sweetness and wax and splintered wood.A honey bee will make about a twelfth of a teaspoon of honey in her whole lifetime. Yet if you were to cut a piece of string equivalent to the combined flight distance made by foragers for just one jar of honey, it would reach almost one-and-a- half times around the world. I wonder how many lifetimes is oozing from the combs.I abandon my spoon and begin using my hands. They glisten and stick to things, and everything sticks to them. We’re licking our fingers and the taste makes me think of something intricately spun, clear and sharp and full of the sun.‘How did it go?’ Pat asks, when I call up later to tell him about the harvest.I did 20 workouts in 48 hours so you don\u0027t have to... just...I can cry and scream when I\u0027m running: TANA RAMSAY explains...Share this articleI try to describe what the inside of the hive looked like and how we harvested the comb, what it felt like to carry it away in my hands.‘I want to see you,’ he says.‘I want to see you too.’The day the idea arrives, just ten months earlier, I am wanting badly to escape. But I quickly bury the thought. Because I can’t just get out. I’ve already moved houses, changed cities, to take this job at a charity in Oxford – I can’t just up and leave.          A single honey bee will make around one twelfth of a spoon of honey in its lifetimeAs I walk in to work each morning I feel the muscles at the back of my neck clench, and they stay like that until I leave. The plant I brought in to brighten my desk has died and I’m not sure how to dispose of it.The skin around my eyes is tight. Maybe the screen is too bright or my focus is too narrow, or maybe muscles are tired of bracing themselves against everything that has been pressing in. I rub my eyes, refocus. This is when the idea comes back again.‘I might get a beehive,’ I say out loud, to no one in particular. Joanna who sits at the desk opposite bellows a laugh and points at my sorry pot plant. ‘Madness,’ she says bluntly, and returns to her screen. No one else says anything. I don’t say anything. And that, it seems, is the end of it.Home from work and too wound up to stay inside, I open the back door, step out into the garden. A nerve at the back of my eye buzzes as if the whirr of the computer screen has got inside my head.But for one moment, maybe two, sheltered by the holly in my back garden that pricks my thighs, I forget where I am. Forget the house that doesn’t feel like home yet, and the hectic work schedule.This is when the idea arrives. Here is where the bees would be.          Helen, pictured, learned about bee keeping while living in London before moving to OxfordI learned about beekeeping a few years ago when I lived in London, where I met Luke, who has hives all over the city. Urban beekeeping is a big thing now – part of a resurgence over the past decade in beekeeping as a hobby.The first time we met, Luke was wearing a cream three-piece suit, a pink shirt and a summer boater, and he was swinging a blue IKEA bag. We were outside Coram’s Fields, a children’s park in Central London, where he kept two hives in a thin strip of undergrowth behind the cafe.‘So you’ve come to see the bees?’ he said, and I nodded.‘Some people believe that bees can smell your fear,’ he said, as he unlocked a gate in the iron railings and we followed a gravel path around. So as we pulled on our protective suits, I concentrated on not being afraid, but when he lifted a hive lid and they began seething out I was terrified. Beneath the lid the space was packed with wooden frames hanging perpendicular to the roofline, each one filled to its edges with comb, covered and crawling with bees.I hadn’t even realised until then that honey bees are different from bumblebees that there are more than 20,000 species of bee in the world, and only a small fraction of them actually make honey.Soon I was beekeeping whenever I could. Luke would send a text message with an address and a time of meeting and I’d jump on my bike and race through the streets to go and join him. It would be another story to have a colony of bees by the back fence of the house I was renting in Oxford with my friend Becky. And in truth, I’m not so well versed in keeping things. I haven’t lived anywhere longer than 18 months in my adult life. I don’t find it difficult to make new friends and bar a few misjudged kerfuffles, I haven’t had a boyfriend for years.On Christmas Day, my brother reaches under the tree for a small hand-made envelope and holds it out towards me.          One Christmas, Helen\u0027s brother and their friends bought her a colony of bees as a presentInside the envelope is a drawing of a honey bee. On the back are the names of friends who have all put money in to buy me a colony. Next to their names is the address of a farm near Banbury.This is where the bees are waiting, the note says. You can collect them in the spring. I’m touched, and thrilled, and panicked.And so, one Sunday in March, Luke and I drive to the farm to collect the colony.Back in Oxford we put on our beekeeping suits, then take the box out and open it, slipping the wooden frames out and placing them inside the boat-shaped, tangerine-coloured hive I’ve bought.In May, I’m visited by my friend Dan from Leeds. We sit on the doorstep with a bottle of wine and I tell him about all the research I’m doing into bees. Dan reaches over and ruffles my hair.‘Been staying in a lot recently, have you?’ he laughs. ‘You’re turning bee-obsessed. Why don’t you give yourself a break? Have some fun, for Christ’s sake!’I’m caught off guard. Perhaps I have been too caught up. But the hive has become a counterweight to a work environment I’ve been finding stressful. I’ve begun to relax out here to drop some of the rigid outer casings that were holding me stiffly and rather unhappily in place.The following month, I am itching to see Luke and for him to see the hive. ‘Look at that,’ he says, lifting a bar out. ‘Now that’s a good start.’The comb attached to it is thick and full at least as long as my forearm. The walls of a single hexagonal cell are only eight-hundredths of a millimetre thick. I peer in, trying to make out inidual cells under those thousands of crowding feet. Inside we spot eggs and larvae, surrounded by pollen and nectar and a soft rim of honey stores.‘Well,’ he says, when we’re nearly through, ‘there must be nearly 100,000 bees in here. It’s the biggest colony I’ve seen all year.’When a hive is full, the colony will split in two. There’s a lesson in here somewhere. As I feel new spaces forming, new possibilities opening beyond the hive, I too have been preparing to break out.Another friend, Dulcie, says: ‘You should meet my friend Pat. He’s a beekeeper too. Maybe we can all meet up when you’re in London next week. You two have just the same taste in furniture.’I laugh and say that I didn’t know I had any taste in furniture but yes, OK, I will meet this beekeeper with the chairs that are just like mine.          In September, Helen\u0027s hive had been transformed - filled with honeycombWhen the weekend comes, I go straight to the station after work and catch the train to London, then sit in my seat and watch as the view outside the window begins to crawl, and then to flow past.Then it is Sunday, and there I am waiting for Dulcie’s friend, hoping we’ll find something to talk about or that, if we don’t, he’ll leave quickly.‘Dulcie told me you’re a beekeeper,’ I say, stepping back into the doorway to let him through.‘I’m not a beekeeper,’ he says as he takes off his shoes.‘I don’t know where she got that idea.’ And then there is a pause. ‘My uncle’s a beekeeper,’ he offers. ‘Oh dear.’I’ve seen Pat again. He’s a musician he makes music. I’ve heard it, and it’s really good.We sit on a log in a park in South London eating toasted sandwiches sticky with melted cheese, and talk about being kids and growing up.As I walk away after meeting him each time I have a feeling of being differently weighted. I am quieter as I move around, and lighter, like something emptied. The soles of my feet notice the ground under them. Not just firmness or softness but also movement, like the rumble of this lorry passing.The next time I see Pat I am due to visit him at his flat.We meet at Forest Hill station and he grins when he sees me, and springs a little on his feet. We walk back to his flat.Later I tell him I’d like to kiss him. There is a pause of a few moments that feels like a very long time indeed.And the time to leave and catch my bus arrives, and I don’t leave. .‘This doesn’t happen to me very often,’ he says afterwards.‘This doesn’t happen to me very often either.’On the day of the harvest, in September, it is clear right away that the inside of the hive has been transformed. Where eggs and larvae lay only a month ago, we now find row upon row of honeycomb.We fill one large Kilner jar and six small ones – it takes us three hours.Over this past season, it seems to me that the hive – that teeming space by the far fence – became a refuge.Down by the hive, away from the city’s tough exteriors, I found a place where I could take my armour plating off could become more exposed, more capable of touching and being touched. Perhaps I became better at caring, too.Pat and I have begun thinking that we might want to make some changes, move a bit closer to each other, some time soon.I can’t shake the feeling I have when I look at him sometimes that through this experience of beekeeping, of learning about and listening to the colony, I might have called something up – might have begun to articulate and name a connection I needed.© Helen Jukes, 2018 A Honeybee Heart Has Five Openings, by Helen Jukes, is published by Scribner UK on July 26, priced £14.99.

PG Wodehouse, pictured above in 1968She writes: ‘Only nuisance has been that slimmer hips has resulted in a tendency to lose my skirt when I cross a street. Have to be held together by safety pins.’The letters between the two highlight a shared admiration for each other’s work – as well as a mutual distrust of the publishing business which made their names. Dame Agatha tells Wodehouse she is frequently infuriated by proof-readers who insist on ‘correcting’ the grammar of her characters’ dialogue.She says: ‘It really does enrage me, because few people I have ever met do talk grammatically and this includes myself.’Dame Agatha also quickly tired of the numerous national celebrations in 1970 to mark her 80th birthday, writing: ‘Why should people congratulate one for being 80 years old – no damned merit in it.’Wodehouse died on February 14, 1975. Dame Agatha died aged 85 on January 12, 1976.  \u0027Let\u0027s make Jeeves sexy\u0027PG Wodehouse considered sexing-up his best-loved creation Jeeves for the theatre.In a letter to producer Guy Bolton from February 5, 1951, Wodehouse said of a possible comedy to feature the valet and his gentleman master Bertie Wooster: ‘We ought to write a completely new play starring Jeeves – something a bit risky with a lot of sex in it.‘My type of story is apt to be a bit thin on stage… So why don’t we try to get something sexy for a Jeeves play?’The idea of sexing-up Jeeves – perhaps in an attempt to attract an American audience – will surprise readers who know the character only for impeccable manners and unfailing acumen.Eventually, Wodehouse and Bolton wrote the comedy Come On, Jeeves – first performed in 1954."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/22/4E2C574E00000578-0-image-m-4_1531429839704.jpg","title":"Bath University academics urged stop saying know case students feel inadequate","story":"    Academics at Bath University (pictured) have been urged to avoid saying ‘as you know’ in case students will be left feeling inadequateJoanna Williams, a former university lecturer and author, criticised the advice last night.

In 2016, Barclays scrapped £8 billion of Lobo loans by converting them to fixed-rate loans, at a cost of £182 million to the bank.Barclays board row over possible £61bn merger with rival...Barclays fraud case kicked out: Blow for the Serious Fraud...Share this articleThe councils’ claim form accuses the bank of ‘deceit andor fraudulent misrepresentation’ as its bankers were secretly rigging Libor, which was ‘integral’ to the rate at which Lobo loans had to be paid back.Many local authorities took out the loans as they appeared to promise lower interest rates than those offered by central government. But the loans remain highly contentious as they gave banks the power to impose new rates at certain points. Borrowers could reject the new terms, but would then be forced to repay the entire loan straight away.Barclays and the local authorities declined to comment. But Lianne Craig, a partner at law firm Hausfeld, which is representing the councils, confirmed it had issued a ‘protective claim’ in the High Court.A full claim is due to be filed in the coming months. In 2015, a parliamentary committee launched an investigation into Lobo loans.          Manchester is among the local authorities launching the action against BarclaysRob Carver, a former derivatives trader at Barclays, described the loans as ‘horrible stuff’, telling MPs: ‘I do not think anyone who fully understood it would do it.’Crippling repayment rates of 7 to 9 per cent were attached to some of the loans and are thought to have cost taxpayers tens of millions of pounds in interest a year.The 14 local authorities – Bristol, Bradford, Greater Manchester, Kirklees, Leeds, Liverpool, Newcastle, North East Lincolnshire, Nottingham, Oldham, Sheffield, South Gloucestershire, Walsall and West Yorkshire – launched the action. They are preparing to put a number to the total value of the claim if Barclays seeks to defend the action, rather than settle.The councils say the loans – entered into between 2004 and 2010 – should be rescinded with fees returned. They also want compensation for damages.On June 27, 2012, the Financial Services Authority, the precursor to the Financial Conduct Authority, fined Barclays £59.5 million over manipulation of Libor – the London interbank offered rate. Some Lobo loans were directly linked to Libor rates, and many others were influenced by it. In some cases, repayment rates rose if Libor rates fell out of a certain range.Joel Benjamin, of Debt Resistance UK, said: ‘It’s high time banks were made to pay to clean up their own mess.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/14/16/4E3D2B2900000578-0-image-m-5_1531583925313.jpg","title":"TANA RAMSAY explains exercise helps deal family trauma","story":"    Tana Ramsay, pictured, uses her daily run as an excuse to cry and screamThere is much for Tana Ramsay to be grateful for today. But the wife of sweary television chef Gordon Ramsay, now head of a £43 million restaurant empire, is not immune to shedding a few tears every now and again – indeed, she says, it’s a necessity.Running around Wimbledon Common in South-West London, as Tana does several times a week with the family’s two dogs, she allows herself to cry and occasionally, even, to scream. For the last couple of years have wreaked a heavy emotional toll.There was the devastating loss of their son, the couple’s fifth child, when Tana had a miscarriage at 21 weeks. Then, last year, a bust-up between Gordon and Tana’s father, Chris Hutcheson – who used to run Gordon Ramsay Holdings – ended at the Old Bailey, with the latter jailed for six months for hacking into Gordon’s emails.Earlier it was revealed that Chris had a secret second family, with grown-up children. ‘It’s easy to put a smile on and say, “Everything is absolutely fine!” ’ says Tana.‘But when you’re running, with your music on, you can cry. You can scream. That’s important. You can’t keep it in because it comes back to haunt you if you haven’t processed it. That’s what causes long-term problems.’DR MICHAEL MOSLEY: Keep your blood sugar in check... even if...The many reasons for buying a Georgian house... they\u0027ve got...Share this articleThere is no sign of this emotional turmoil today. Tana, 43, is glowing with good health. She reveals that her father, now 70, is out of jail and competed in his 90th marathon in April this year – alongside his grandchildren.So they’re all back in touch? ‘Oh yes, absolutely,’ Tana says. She won’t say more, but it’s evident that Chris is now very much part of the family again. Whether he and Gordon have patched up their differences is less clear.And Tana, like her father, is arguably in the best shape of her life. She runs marathons, has completed a half-ironman, and is currently training for the London Triathlon to raise money for the couple’s charity, the Gordon and Tana Ramsay Foundation, which has donated £850,000 to London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital since 2015.          Tana, pictured centre with husband Gordon, right, and from left son Jack, family friend Alexander Dundas, and daughters Holly and MatildaIt is exercise, more than anything, which has helped the family cope with the tribulations of the past two years.‘What it does is allow you to process things,’ she says.‘Whether it is cycling and chatting together, or running and having a cry on your own, you have to have that release. You also have to have those moments where you allow yourself to feel really sad, when you’re thinking, “Why me?” We’re all going to think like that occasionally. It means we can handle it. It has drawn us together as a family.‘It’s also important to talk with the children and not just think everything is fine. Gordon’s a really big one for talking. Sometimes I just say to him “Seriously?”, and he’s like: “No, we have to talk about it.” Sometimes that’s irritating.’          The Ramsay\u0027s pictured here with Victoria Beckham, centre, are an incredibly sporty familySport runs through almost everything the Ramsay family does. The couple’s four children – Megan, 20, twins Jack and Holly, 18, and Tilly, 16 – compete variously in swimming, netball, rugby, ju-jitsu, hockey and water polo. Their schedule is frenetic: Tana shrugs at the idea that she’s a supermum, but it is impressively well-orchestrated.Jack can be dropped off at school in Dulwich, South-East London, by 6.30am, and Tilly and Holly to their school in Richmond by 7.30am, which leaves Tana time to have a run on Wimbledon Common with the dogs by 7.50am. She’s home by nine, showered and at work at her beauty salon in Battersea by 9.30am.There’s also a home gym – which the whole family uses – and gruelling three-hour cycle rides at the weekends. It’s precisely because the kids are so busy that you won’t see them falling out of nightclubs like other celebrity offspring.‘I don’t worry about the kids going off the rails because they have sport,’ she explains. ‘Yes, they’re teenagers and they’re all on Instagram doing those weird pouts. How could they not be?‘All I can do is make sure they have a healthy relationship between their body and food. Exercise is good not only to keep in shape but mentally it’s fantastic, and a great discipline for kids. Showing them we do it, and instilling that attitude in them, is so important. They’ve been studying for A-level and GCSE exams and I’ve said, “Do a couple of hours of exercise and your brains will work better.”‘I do think it’s helped them to deal with the stress.’Tana admits to following her children on the Find My Friends app, which allows users to see the location of others using GPS. It hasn’t always been reassuring.‘Jack went out after his exams,’ she says. ‘I woke up and it was 5am and he wasn’t home. I’d promised I wouldn’t call because he’s 18, so I went on the app and then saw he was at St Thomas’ Hospital so I freaked and rang him, but tried to sound relaxed. In fact, he was just getting in an Uber.’Tana has run nine marathons and Gordon has competed over a dozen. When Megan turned 18 – the minimum age to take part – she begged to be allowed to do it too. Jack and Holly competed for the first time this year, while Tilly, who has her own CBBC show, Matilda And The Ramsay Bunch, is ‘chomping at the bit’ to have her chance.GORDON, 51, naturally, has the best time (3.30) – ‘have you seen his thighs?’ – followed by Tana, a respectable 25 minutes behind. All of them except Tilly, who will be on a water polo tour, are taking part in the London Triathlon on August 4 to 5. Surely there must be competition? Tana laughs. ‘Between Jack and Gordon it can get pretty intense,’ she admits. ‘But Jack hasn’t beaten me at the marathon yet. They all make me incredibly proud, and I get very emotional.‘There’s so much pressure on them already with social media, so the more normal we keep it the easier it is as a family to just be us, and for them to have the confidence to be themselves.’Tana is clearly comfortable in her own skin, and felt no pressure to stay in shape as Gordon’s celebrity rose. They married in 1996 when he was head chef at Aubergine in Chelsea – now he has 35 restaurants across the globe and seven Michelin stars, along with TV projects in the UK and US.The couple count the Beckhams among their closest friends, so does Tana train with Victoria? ‘No, although when we’re in America we do go to Soul Cycle classes together. I’d love to get Victoria in an ironman competition.’ Tana looks mischievous. Would she do it? ‘No, I doubt it. She’d look at me like I was some kind of maniac, I imagine.’Tana obviously sees things differently – for Gordon and her, exercise is a release. The couple take long cycle rides together on Sundays, completing up to 60 miles a time over the Surrey hills as part of their triathlon training.‘We’ve always been good at spending time away from the kids, just the two of us. Finding something which helps you remember what you like in that person, after so many years of marriage, is great. Gordon might have been away all week in the US, but we’ll go out early in the morning and spend several hours on our bikes and catch up.‘For me, a mum in my 40s, it’s also about doing something just to feel good about myself. I’ve given the kids all of my attention for all of these years, so it’s time for me. I really enjoy it – it’s so social.’Food, perhaps unsurprisingly, is important in the Ramsay household but Tana insists they have ‘a good balance’. ‘I never obsessed over having perfect food for the kids at all times,’ she says. ‘I never watched over them at parties, never said, “Don’t eat this.” I didn’t want to be a helicopter mum, forever hovering over them.‘We’ll have chocolate in the fridge, but our meals are usually healthy. That’s how it should be.’They try to eat together as a family as much as possible but their conflicting schedules mean it happens ‘maybe once or twice a week’.Breakfast is ‘a slice of toast while running down the stairs’, she says. When asked if the children are talented cooks, she pauses before sniggering: ‘They do cook.’Refreshingly, too, there’s no special ‘training diet’ as she prepares for the triathlon. Tana has always run and once finished a 5km in a very good time of 19 minutes. The London Triathlon involves a 750m swim (‘longer than it sounds’, she jokes, grimly), then a 20km cycle ride followed by a 5km run.It’s for a great cause. The Gordon and Tana Ramsay Foundation, set up in 2014, has 235 competitors signed up to Team Ramsay, and money raised for Great Ormond Street has, in previous years, funded research projects and intensive-care equipment.Does she see herself doing it at 80? ‘My father has just had a hip replacement and has been on this health regime. He’s lost a stone in three weeks and ran his 90th marathon in April with three of his grandchildren and one of his sons. I’d like to aspire to that.‘At 80, I want to have energy, I want to be saying to Gordon, “Let’s go on holiday with our bikes and panniers, somewhere like Hawaii.”‘Enjoying our time after working so hard, just ambling around. That’s how I see us.’    Start in a low lunge, with one knee down and the other leg forwards. Then, engaging your core muscles, switch legs.

There’s no stopping it. My friends and I have harvested two honeycombs from the beehive I’ve been keeping and now we’re in the kitchen of my two-up, two-down in Oxford, sieving it over a pan, straining the comb and mashing it with our spoons. The honey gloops and the smell is like sweetness and wax and splintered wood.A honey bee will make about a twelfth of a teaspoon of honey in her whole lifetime. Yet if you were to cut a piece of string equivalent to the combined flight distance made by foragers for just one jar of honey, it would reach almost one-and-a- half times around the world. I wonder how many lifetimes is oozing from the combs.I abandon my spoon and begin using my hands. They glisten and stick to things, and everything sticks to them. We’re licking our fingers and the taste makes me think of something intricately spun, clear and sharp and full of the sun.‘How did it go?’ Pat asks, when I call up later to tell him about the harvest.I did 20 workouts in 48 hours so you don\u0027t have to... just...I can cry and scream when I\u0027m running: TANA RAMSAY explains...Share this articleI try to describe what the inside of the hive looked like and how we harvested the comb, what it felt like to carry it away in my hands.‘I want to see you,’ he says.‘I want to see you too.’The day the idea arrives, just ten months earlier, I am wanting badly to escape. But I quickly bury the thought. Because I can’t just get out. I’ve already moved houses, changed cities, to take this job at a charity in Oxford – I can’t just up and leave.          A single honey bee will make around one twelfth of a spoon of honey in its lifetimeAs I walk in to work each morning I feel the muscles at the back of my neck clench, and they stay like that until I leave. The plant I brought in to brighten my desk has died and I’m not sure how to dispose of it.The skin around my eyes is tight. Maybe the screen is too bright or my focus is too narrow, or maybe muscles are tired of bracing themselves against everything that has been pressing in. I rub my eyes, refocus. This is when the idea comes back again.‘I might get a beehive,’ I say out loud, to no one in particular. Joanna who sits at the desk opposite bellows a laugh and points at my sorry pot plant. ‘Madness,’ she says bluntly, and returns to her screen. No one else says anything. I don’t say anything. And that, it seems, is the end of it.Home from work and too wound up to stay inside, I open the back door, step out into the garden. A nerve at the back of my eye buzzes as if the whirr of the computer screen has got inside my head.But for one moment, maybe two, sheltered by the holly in my back garden that pricks my thighs, I forget where I am. Forget the house that doesn’t feel like home yet, and the hectic work schedule.This is when the idea arrives. Here is where the bees would be.          Helen, pictured, learned about bee keeping while living in London before moving to OxfordI learned about beekeeping a few years ago when I lived in London, where I met Luke, who has hives all over the city. Urban beekeeping is a big thing now – part of a resurgence over the past decade in beekeeping as a hobby.The first time we met, Luke was wearing a cream three-piece suit, a pink shirt and a summer boater, and he was swinging a blue IKEA bag. We were outside Coram’s Fields, a children’s park in Central London, where he kept two hives in a thin strip of undergrowth behind the cafe.‘So you’ve come to see the bees?’ he said, and I nodded.‘Some people believe that bees can smell your fear,’ he said, as he unlocked a gate in the iron railings and we followed a gravel path around. So as we pulled on our protective suits, I concentrated on not being afraid, but when he lifted a hive lid and they began seething out I was terrified. Beneath the lid the space was packed with wooden frames hanging perpendicular to the roofline, each one filled to its edges with comb, covered and crawling with bees.I hadn’t even realised until then that honey bees are different from bumblebees that there are more than 20,000 species of bee in the world, and only a small fraction of them actually make honey.Soon I was beekeeping whenever I could. Luke would send a text message with an address and a time of meeting and I’d jump on my bike and race through the streets to go and join him. It would be another story to have a colony of bees by the back fence of the house I was renting in Oxford with my friend Becky. And in truth, I’m not so well versed in keeping things. I haven’t lived anywhere longer than 18 months in my adult life. I don’t find it difficult to make new friends and bar a few misjudged kerfuffles, I haven’t had a boyfriend for years.On Christmas Day, my brother reaches under the tree for a small hand-made envelope and holds it out towards me.          One Christmas, Helen\u0027s brother and their friends bought her a colony of bees as a presentInside the envelope is a drawing of a honey bee. On the back are the names of friends who have all put money in to buy me a colony. Next to their names is the address of a farm near Banbury.This is where the bees are waiting, the note says. You can collect them in the spring. I’m touched, and thrilled, and panicked.And so, one Sunday in March, Luke and I drive to the farm to collect the colony.Back in Oxford we put on our beekeeping suits, then take the box out and open it, slipping the wooden frames out and placing them inside the boat-shaped, tangerine-coloured hive I’ve bought.In May, I’m visited by my friend Dan from Leeds. We sit on the doorstep with a bottle of wine and I tell him about all the research I’m doing into bees. Dan reaches over and ruffles my hair.‘Been staying in a lot recently, have you?’ he laughs. ‘You’re turning bee-obsessed. Why don’t you give yourself a break? Have some fun, for Christ’s sake!’I’m caught off guard. Perhaps I have been too caught up. But the hive has become a counterweight to a work environment I’ve been finding stressful. I’ve begun to relax out here to drop some of the rigid outer casings that were holding me stiffly and rather unhappily in place.The following month, I am itching to see Luke and for him to see the hive. ‘Look at that,’ he says, lifting a bar out. ‘Now that’s a good start.’The comb attached to it is thick and full at least as long as my forearm. The walls of a single hexagonal cell are only eight-hundredths of a millimetre thick. I peer in, trying to make out inidual cells under those thousands of crowding feet. Inside we spot eggs and larvae, surrounded by pollen and nectar and a soft rim of honey stores.‘Well,’ he says, when we’re nearly through, ‘there must be nearly 100,000 bees in here. It’s the biggest colony I’ve seen all year.’When a hive is full, the colony will split in two. There’s a lesson in here somewhere. As I feel new spaces forming, new possibilities opening beyond the hive, I too have been preparing to break out.Another friend, Dulcie, says: ‘You should meet my friend Pat. He’s a beekeeper too. Maybe we can all meet up when you’re in London next week. You two have just the same taste in furniture.’I laugh and say that I didn’t know I had any taste in furniture but yes, OK, I will meet this beekeeper with the chairs that are just like mine.          In September, Helen\u0027s hive had been transformed - filled with honeycombWhen the weekend comes, I go straight to the station after work and catch the train to London, then sit in my seat and watch as the view outside the window begins to crawl, and then to flow past.Then it is Sunday, and there I am waiting for Dulcie’s friend, hoping we’ll find something to talk about or that, if we don’t, he’ll leave quickly.‘Dulcie told me you’re a beekeeper,’ I say, stepping back into the doorway to let him through.‘I’m not a beekeeper,’ he says as he takes off his shoes.‘I don’t know where she got that idea.’ And then there is a pause. ‘My uncle’s a beekeeper,’ he offers. ‘Oh dear.’I’ve seen Pat again. He’s a musician he makes music. I’ve heard it, and it’s really good.We sit on a log in a park in South London eating toasted sandwiches sticky with melted cheese, and talk about being kids and growing up.As I walk away after meeting him each time I have a feeling of being differently weighted. I am quieter as I move around, and lighter, like something emptied. The soles of my feet notice the ground under them. Not just firmness or softness but also movement, like the rumble of this lorry passing.The next time I see Pat I am due to visit him at his flat.We meet at Forest Hill station and he grins when he sees me, and springs a little on his feet. We walk back to his flat.Later I tell him I’d like to kiss him. There is a pause of a few moments that feels like a very long time indeed.And the time to leave and catch my bus arrives, and I don’t leave. .‘This doesn’t happen to me very often,’ he says afterwards.‘This doesn’t happen to me very often either.’On the day of the harvest, in September, it is clear right away that the inside of the hive has been transformed. Where eggs and larvae lay only a month ago, we now find row upon row of honeycomb.We fill one large Kilner jar and six small ones – it takes us three hours.Over this past season, it seems to me that the hive – that teeming space by the far fence – became a refuge.Down by the hive, away from the city’s tough exteriors, I found a place where I could take my armour plating off could become more exposed, more capable of touching and being touched. Perhaps I became better at caring, too.Pat and I have begun thinking that we might want to make some changes, move a bit closer to each other, some time soon.I can’t shake the feeling I have when I look at him sometimes that through this experience of beekeeping, of learning about and listening to the colony, I might have called something up – might have begun to articulate and name a connection I needed.© Helen Jukes, 2018 A Honeybee Heart Has Five Openings, by Helen Jukes, is published by Scribner UK on July 26, priced £14.99.

Really! Disgusting idea!) to charity sales’.Dame Agatha was 79 when she began corresponding with 88-year-old Wodehouse in 1969.Fury over plans to build 215 homes on the farm that inspired...Broke, forgotten and buried in an unmarked grave: Tragic end...Share this articlePerhaps not surprisingly given their respective ages, the veteran authors were preoccupied with health matters.In a letter dated May 13, 1970, Dame Agatha lampoons the pretensions of clueless doctors who dole out antibiotics ‘until one of them does the trick or alternatively lays you in your coffin!’ She also celebrates the loss of four stone ‘as a good result’ of the heart attack she suffered in 1969.          PG Wodehouse, pictured above in 1968She writes: ‘Only nuisance has been that slimmer hips has resulted in a tendency to lose my skirt when I cross a street. Have to be held together by safety pins.’The letters between the two highlight a shared admiration for each other’s work – as well as a mutual distrust of the publishing business which made their names. Dame Agatha tells Wodehouse she is frequently infuriated by proof-readers who insist on ‘correcting’ the grammar of her characters’ dialogue.She says: ‘It really does enrage me, because few people I have ever met do talk grammatically and this includes myself.’Dame Agatha also quickly tired of the numerous national celebrations in 1970 to mark her 80th birthday, writing: ‘Why should people congratulate one for being 80 years old – no damned merit in it.’Wodehouse died on February 14, 1975. Dame Agatha died aged 85 on January 12, 1976.  \u0027Let\u0027s make Jeeves sexy\u0027PG Wodehouse considered sexing-up his best-loved creation Jeeves for the theatre.In a letter to producer Guy Bolton from February 5, 1951, Wodehouse said of a possible comedy to feature the valet and his gentleman master Bertie Wooster: ‘We ought to write a completely new play starring Jeeves – something a bit risky with a lot of sex in it.‘My type of story is apt to be a bit thin on stage… So why don’t we try to get something sexy for a Jeeves play?’The idea of sexing-up Jeeves – perhaps in an attempt to attract an American audience – will surprise readers who know the character only for impeccable manners and unfailing acumen.Eventually, Wodehouse and Bolton wrote the comedy Come On, Jeeves – first performed in 1954."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/14/22/4E3FB56A00000578-0-image-m-17_1531604087387.jpg","title":"Labour opens biggest poll lead election Tory ratings tumble","story":"    An Opinium poll for The Observer newspaper found that Tory support has plummeted to 36 per cent - some six points lower than it was in June.Meanwhile, Labour have stayed on 40 per cent, while Ukip - the Brexit backing party most commentators had written off - have surged to 8 per cent.Steve Baker, the ex Brexit minister who followed his boss Mr Davis and quit in fury at the proposals, said the poll shows that backing Chequers would effectively hand the keys to No10 to Mr Corbyn.He said: \u0027It looks like Chequers means Corbyn.

Some 4,000 police and security forces have been deployed across Paris during the World Cup festivities, and a vast security perimeter prohibiting vehicle access has been set up around the Champs Elysees avenue          As the hundreds of thousands of revellers gradually left the famous avenue, police used water cannon to disperse remaining troublemakers at around 11:30pmAs the hundreds of thousands of revellers gradually left the famous avenue, police used water cannon to disperse remaining troublemakers at around 11:30 pm.Elsewhere in France, authorities said clashes erupted in the southern city of Lyon between police and about 100 youths who had climbed on top of a police vehicle at an open-air showing of the match in the city centre. As night fell, The Eiffel Tower flashed 1998-2018 to mark France\u0027s two World Cup titles.The Arc de Triomph was awash in the national colors, lit with the rooster, the faces of the winning team and the words \u0027Proud to be Blue,\u0027 or French.The celebrations were spread across the nation.For all the crazy antics - and some revelers who got out of control - a sense of patriotism and unity was almost visceral.         Hundred of thousands of French fans flooded the Champs-Elysees to celebrate their nation\u0027s World Cup win          Triumph: 90,000 people gathered next to the Eiffel tower to watch the match on vast TV screens          French fans on the Champs de Mars near the Eiffel Tower watch their team\u0027s triumph against Croatia in the World Cup final           French fans celebrate their side\u0027s victory in front of the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs Elysees in Paris on SundayEarlier the crowds had gathered next to the Eiffel tower to watch the match on vast TV screens.There were choruses of the Marseillaise, honking horns and hundreds of thousands of red, white and blue French flags fluttering in the breeze.The boom of fireworks and firecrackers filled the air and car drivers honked their horns incessantly to celebrate France\u0027s second world title after their triumph on home soil in 1998.Raining champions: France storm to second World Cup as team...Pussy Riot say they were behind World Cup pitch invasion...Share this articleA deafening chorus of \u0027We are the champions, We are the champions\u0027 rang out from the Sacre Coeur in the north of the city to the Sorbonne on the Left Bank.Even before the final whistle, crowds streamed on to the Champs Elysees, the elegant, tree-lined boulevard that runs up to the Arc de Triomphe, the traditional gathering place for celebration, including the Bastille Day parade 24 hours earlier.\u0027It\u0027s just astonishing what they\u0027ve done,\u0027 said Josh, 41, who travelled from Brittany to Paris to watch the match. \u0027Pogba, Mbappe, Grizou (Griezmann).

Any damage, such as recent collapses at Pompeii, creates world headlines.The towns were destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79AD, when thousands of the residents died in lava flows, choking clouds of poison gas or showers of ash that left them buried many metres deep, preserving the foods they ate and the tables they ate off, the brilliantly painted walls of their homes, the rude slogans and the shop prices they scrawled on street corners and, hauntingly, their own petrified bodies, to be rediscovered in the 18th century. It took three years from Huber’s first idea of taking an artist’s eye into the heart of the sites to win consent from the Italian authorities for the Expanded Interiors project and to work out how to realise it, with funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council. The panels were built and painted in Newcastle, which is pioneering collaboration between arts, sciences, fine arts and engineering departments. The team had to install them by carrying the sections through narrow, steep streets where using machinery is hazardous, and cramped interiors rich in original painted plaster. The rooms in Pompeii and Herculaeneum were laser-scanned by Alex Turner, of the university’s archaeology department, to ensure that Huber’s brilliantly coloured aluminium panels would fit into the spaces without any risk of damage to the beautiful but faded, painted Roman walls. The measurements and engineering of the panels were so precise that their feet stand on modern cement repairs rather than original floor surfaces.“These fantastic paintings have been studied by archaeologists and art historians, but I am responding to them as an artist,” said Huber, who is now based at the university. “To me they mean something else – they are not just wall coverings or statements of wealth and prestige. They are full of wit and imagination, they are playing with colour and temperature, literary references, with the idea of spaces, tricky perspectives, interiors and exteriors, arches and openings.”At Pompeii, she has taken over what was once a sumptuous house, built on five levels, with two rare features in the crowded city. One is an opulent private bathhouse, the other a cryptoporticus, an interior hall painted to look like an exterior colonnade, deep in the coolest levels of the house – a space for walking and talking protected from the fierce heat. By the time of the eruption that destroyed the city, however, the beautiful painted rooms had already been severely damaged by an earthquake in 62AD, and had been used as storerooms.Her paintings echo the ominously confusing spaces and dark painted windows, doors and arches of her Roman predecessors – features some have suggested were seen as portals to the shadowy world of the ancestors.But she has also tried to put back some of the jokes. The Herculaneum installation, in a room in the House of the Beautiful Courtyard – once used for a museum display by Amedeo Maiuri, legendary director of both sites for almost four decades up to 1961 – incorporates the words “ciao bella”, hidden in the panels: a few startled visitors have already deciphered it. The response to Huber’s work pleases the director, Francesco Sirano, who only took over last year and is determined to make Herculaneum and all the work being carried out there more open and more connected to the modern town, whose washing lines hang over the cliff edge of the ruins. “It is a work of art, but it is also a way of translating the past for the present,” he said. Turner has also laser-scanned precious original objects chosen by Huber from the site stores, and 3D-printed them to incorporate in the installations. At Herculaneum these include a haunting silver head of Empress Livia, immaculate from behind but the face so damaged that it appears to be screaming at the fate of the town. It would be impossible to incorporate the fragile originals, but in Pompeii a small boy suddenly spotted and reached out to touch one of the recreated objects – a little cup with an absurd human face, puff cheeked and sticking its tongue out. He may have missed the layered history of the battered Roman walls, but he knew a joke when he saw one and snorted with laughter, to Huber’s delight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45dfee06d1c402492e620669d9da3682e213c7da/99_251_3396_2037/master/3396.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b20ab4022bf41e488deb344f85f9922c","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"President Trump’s visit to the UK, World Cup heartbreak and the Thai boys rescued from a cave – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fb9d542a75ded67987400598b3c855b11c8b376/0_455_5032_3019/master/5032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4950e36e9e512641798f068a147ee45","title":"the guardian view on home schooling in england a register is needed","story":"The killing of 18-year-old Jordan Burling was needless and preventable, a judge told his mother and grandmother on sentencing them for his manslaughter last week. Burling died from bronchopneumonia following a heart attack in 2016, but the underlying cause was malnutrition and neglect so extreme that it is painful to imagine.Defence lawyers stressed that Mr Burling was an adult, who had made what his grandmother Denise Cranston called a “choice” not to see a doctor. But he was a boy of 12 when his mother told the council she would home-school him. A safeguarding review will now examine how the authorities lost sight of Mr Burling, who had taken no exams nor gained any qualifications, and make recommendations as to how such a disaster can be avoided in future. But there is no reason for the government to wait before acting on behalf of other home-schooled children, of whom there are thought to be around 50,000 in the UK – a number that has increased sharply in recent years.There is no evidence that being home-schooled leads to an increased risk of abuse or neglect. The government believes most home educators do a good job. But reviews following the death from scurvy of eight-year-old Dylan Seabridge in Wales in 2011, and of Khyra Ishaq, who was starved to death aged seven in Birmingham in 2008, highlighted home-schooling as a factor. Concerns around safeguarding, and what happens when children disappear from the view of professionals who might otherwise support them, are one reason why the government is seeking to tighten and clarify the rules surrounding home education.The key proposal is a mandatory register of home-educated children, along with increased monitoring and support from local authorities. The government also promises a tougher approach to schools that encourage parents to remove pupils they are struggling with (“off-rolling”), and to a growing number of unregistered, illegal schools where Ofsted believes pupils may be at risk of radicalisation.It is strongly to be hoped that home-schooling parents and groups, as well as local authorities, will support these changes, which are similar to measures already introduced in Wales. Councils must be equipped and resourced to carry out their duty to ensure all children receive a “suitable” education. Not all parents are equipped to provide such an education, as appalling cases such as that of Mr Burling show. Home educators must recognise this, and support efforts to protect a vulnerable minority, even if this means surrendering some of their highly prized autonomy.Some children and families are failed by schools and councils, which is one reason for the rise in home education. But all children, whatever their parents’ beliefs or their inidual needs, have the right to learn and thrive. It is the state’s duty to make sure they are not deprived of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e3f602dffee4cec2fc33f8c49842bbe0787f81b/0_167_5023_3014/master/5023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14077ef3cab8d87897978aac090e6788","title":"pedallers pilgrimage britains best cycling routes","story":"Wild Cycling author Chris Sidwells shares nine of his favourite rides – from the rugged west Highlands of Scotland to the green and pleasant loops of the home counties  These rides are my choices based on a wide variety of cycling experiences. Don’t consider the routes prescriptive – they are merely an introduction to the possibilities for cycling in different parts of the UK. Use them as a basis for your own exploration of nine parts of the country, each offering a unique day’s cycling.Full English: the Chiltern Hills, BuckinghamshireDistance: 37 milesDifficulty: 610Start and finish: Princes RisboroughNearest station: Princes Risborough“England’s green and pleasant land” perfectly describes the Chilterns. Broad-leaf woods overhang deep seductive lanes that wriggle around and over these chalky hills. Red kites rule the sky, and cricket is played on village greens. The Chilterns are commuter country now, but still charming, and still very English.Head for Chinnor on the north-west edge of the hills, then ride towards them to pick up a cycle-way going south-west to Watlingon, where you leave the trail. Climb Watlington Hill, then go through Christmas Common and Turville Heath take a pitstop at the Barn cafe at Turville Heath Farm, which is excellent. Continue to Marlow, then head north-west along the B482, leaving at Stokenchurch, and go north through the lanes to Princes Risborough.The most unexpected: Dengie Peninsula, EssexDistance: 24 milesDifficulty: 410 (810 if it’s windy)Start and finish: Burnham-on-CrouchNearest station: Burnham-on-CrouchSqueezed between two rivers, just 24 crow-flying miles from the centre of London, there’s a time capsule called the Dengie Peninsula. For a basic loop, follow the B1021 north towards Bradwell, go left after Tillingham through Maylandsea and Latchington, then follow the B1010 back to Burnham-on-Crouch. You ride through rosy brick and painted clapboard villages, past a patchwork quilt of fields. There are little loops you could add, such as visiting Dengie Marshes where you might glimpse a rare hen harrier. It’s so quiet, so peaceful, it’s like riding through the 1950s. Distance: 45 milesDifficulty: 810Start and Finish: BodminNearest station: Bodmin Parkway A ride of stunning sea views with a taste of wild moorland. Follow the Camel Trail from Bodmin to Wadebridge, leaving at the old bridge for Port Isaac, a beautiful Cornish fishing village and location for TV’s Doc Martin.  Continue north on the clifftop road, then join the B-road to Delabole, where you turn left and descend to Trebarwith Strand and its gorgeous beach. Continue north through Tintagel, for an unmissable mid-ride snack at Pengenna Pasties. Then it’s on to Boscastle, where you head inland through Camelford to St Tudy. Go left just outside St Tudy, to experience Bodmin Moor and its villages, before picking up the Camel Trail back to Bodmin. Best urban ride: the Taff Trail, CardiffDistance: 32 milesDifficulty: 510Start and finish: Cardiff BayNearest station: Cardiff Central “We’ve had it done up,” the Welsh comedian Rhod Gilbert says when describing Cardiff. And it has been done up, especially the waterfront of Cardiff Bay, where this ride starts. It’s a glorious place to pootle around on a bike. There are plenty of cafes to choose from – but save them for later, when you get back.  The Taff Trail mixes cycle-ways with quiet roads and is well signposted. This ride is 32 miles there and back to Pontypridd, but you can go on to Abercynon in the Rhondda or even do the whole 55-mile-long Taff Trail and reach the Brecon Beacons. The cycle-way sections are ideal for family rides.Best rite of passage ride: the Strines, SheffieldDistance: 22 milesDifficulty: 810Start and finish: LangsettNearest station: Penistone The Strines is 11 miles of unclassified road on the eastern edge of the Peak District, running from Langsett on the A616 to Moscar Fields on the A57. It’s brutal the road plunges into and out of three steep-sided valleys, with plenty of undulations and exposed moorland in between. Head south from Langsett, keeping right at all junctions, to the A57. Turn around and ride back. The Strines both ways is a local rite of passage, and the hills form part of many local training rides. There are six big climbs if you go both ways, ranging between a third and a half a mile long. Oh, and there’s the Bank View cafe in Langsett. It’s very special. Best cafe ride: Selby, West YorkshireDistance: 24 milesDifficulty: 510Start and finish: SelbyNearest station: Selby A pleasant ride through quiet lanes with a cafe stop about halfway. Start at Selby Abbey (fact: the Rt Rev Dr John Thompson is actually known as the Biking Bishop of Selby), find the B1223 and go north then west to Sherburn in Elmet. Elmet was an ancient British kingdom covering much of what is now West Yorkshire. From Sherburn go south to Hillam then Birkin for the cafe, the Birkin Fisheries Tea Room, which stands in its own grounds – there’s a lake, the food is delicious and the service always smiling. Once re-fuelled, head east to West Haddlesey, then north to Gateforth and on, north-east, to Selby.  Distance: 35 milesDifficulty: 910Start and finish: UlphaNearest station: Broughton in Furness Two of the steepest road climbs in the UK – plus others, long and short – give this ride a total altitude gain of 1,800 metres. The first seven and a half miles from Ulpha to Cockley Beck has only one climb, then you are at the foot of Wrynose heading east with the pass before you. Engage your lowest gear and haul yourself over – there’s no way of finessing it.  Descend to Little Langdale, climb over to Great Langdale. Go right in Elterwater, right at the next junction for Wrynose, then clamber over Hardknott Pass. Continue to Eskdale Green and turn left for the long slog over Birker Fell and back to Ulpha. This ride hurts – but the satisfaction of doing it lasts a lot longer than the pain it causes.The quietest: the Cheviot Hills, NorthumberlandDistance: 47 milesDifficulty: 710Start and finish: RothburyNearest station: Alnmouth (for a regular service) Rothbury is a country town like country towns used to be – gentle and homely, where people enquire about a person’s health and actually want to know the answer. The ride is out and back, mostly uphill out and downhill coming back, tracing the River Coquet almost to its source.  Follow the B6341 west from Rothbury. Take the first right after Hepple then keep left all the way to the end of the road, where if you stop for a moment you will probably hear no other evidence of human life but the sound of your own breath. Refuelling at the Barrowburn Tea Room near the turnaround point is highly recommended.The wildest: Ardgour and Moidart, west HighlandsDistance: 81 milesDifficulty: 810Start and finish: Fort WilliamNearest station: Fort William I saved the best till last. Any ride with a ferry crossing starts ticking wild boxes for me, but this gets a lot wilder. It’s mostly on main roads, but they will be the quietest main roads you’ll ever ride. The busiest, the A82, is first, going south-west from Fort William to the Corran Ferry Terminal. Marvel at the mountains as you cross Loch Linnhe. Then it’s on the A861 west through glens, alongside salty sea lochs, over the tip toes of mountains, around the Sound of Arisaig, where the Isles of Rum, Eigg and Muck are grey-green jewels in a sea setting. Finally you’ll head back to Fort William, and in fine weather the whole of Ben Nevis can be seen. Ready to hit the road? Why not make it count?

However, for Kokotajlo, whose quietly controlled screenplay is rooted in his upbringing as a Jehovah’s Witness, there were other, deeper things going on, too. It took this gentle, softly spoken man from Tameside, in Manchester, 21 days to shoot his film, and in that time his beard turned, somewhat dramatically, from mostly brown to mostly grey. “I lost loads of hair, as well,” he says, placing a hand ruefully on his head. “When we started, I looked about my age, which is 37. By the time we’d finished, I was 10 years older.”Every day brought with it the feeling of transgression. “Even before the shoot, this was a subject I was uncomfortable with,” he says. “As Witnesses, we were told to avoid literature that was critical of us. We were made to feel it was almost on the level of being satanic. When I first got hold of one of these books, not long after I left the religion, I was literally shaking with fear – and when I started working on this project, that fear came right back.” Perhaps, though, this anxiety was also useful. One of the more remarkable things about Apostasy – and there are many it’s hard to imagine a more accomplished debut – is its even-handedness, the way it stirs in the audience sympathy for characters whose beliefs most of us might ordinarily struggle to understand. Kokotajlo nods. “I did feel a pressure to be as accurate and as honest as possible. I didn’t want people still in the religion to be able to say: this is just propaganda. I needed it to be right.” Are Witnesses likely to choose to see it? “That depends. They’ll be advised not to. But if they’re curious, they might. There are the rules, and then there’s what people actually do.”Apostasy is set in Oldham, or a place very like it, and centres on a family of three: Ivanna (Finneran, best known for roles in Happy Valley and Downton Abbey, who is quite superb) and her teenage daughters, Alex (Molly Wright) and Luisa (Sacha Parkinson). Ivanna is a devout Witness away from her job at the council, she spends her time handing out the Watchtower on the street, or at her local Kingdom Hall, listening to the elders preach about Armageddon, which is coming very soon and with it, paradise. Alex is also committed though she suffers from a serious blood condition, she has told her doctor that she would not want a transfusion even if it were a matter of life and death (Witnesses believe that those who respect life as a gift from God do not try to sustain it by the taking of blood, a doctrine they have followed since 1945). Luisa, however, has begun to doubt, and will soon, having become pregnant by her college boyfriend, find herself shunned by her mother and the community. The film is about the three women’s faith, and all the ways in which it is tested. But it’s also, par excellence, about the meagre world they inhabit, a realm that is unnervingly quiet (no music or television), frequently joyless (the Witnesses do not celebrate birthdays, Easter or Christmas, regarding such feast days as pagan), and almost entirely controlled by men (the zealous elders, who rule the roost entirely down at the Kingdom Hall).This is not to say these women are unhappy, precisely that they feel they’re missing out. Ivanna and Alex, if not Luisa, think of Armageddon, after which the Witnesses will spend eternity in paradise on earth, and feel nothing but excitement, a sense of imminent grace and bliss – and while they may be taciturn with each other, they have pretty regular conversations with God. Did Kokotajlo worry about dramatising these conversations? Didn’t those financing his film (it was funded by iFeatures, which is supported by the BBC, the BFI and Creative England) quail at the prospect of a screenplay in which what Alex says to her doctor, and what she says to God, are given equal weight? He smiles (we’re in a Soho hotel which, metaphorically speaking, couldn’t be further from the things we are talking about). “It was hard to convince them what it would look like. But I also realised, and I think they did too, that I could never get across the mindset of the Witnesses, the cognitive dissonance between what they think and what other people think, in a traditional script. The audience needs to understand the weight of their beliefs, the spiritual pressure they’re under. Because that’s what motivates them.”Apostasy will arrive in cinemas just before The Children Act, the film adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel of the same name in which a judge tries the case of a teenage boy who, for religious reasons, refuses the medical treatment that will save his life. Naturally, Kokotajlo has mixed feelings about this. “Why did it have to come out at the same time as ours?” he wails. He doesn’t, though, believe the two narratives have much in common: “It’s an outsider’s book,” he says. “When I read it, I found myself nit-picking. Ex-Witnesses always say: ‘Oh, that’s not quite right.’” What isn’t in doubt, however, is the fact that Jehovah’s Witnesses are still willing to put their lives in the balance by refusing to accept blood. The Jehovah’s Witnesses were founded by Charles Taze Russell in the US in the 1870s, and there are now around 8 million in 235 countries (in the UK, there are 130,000). A group advocating reform of the blood rules believes that in 2016, at a conservative estimate, the prohibition resulted in some 1,220 deaths worldwide between 1961 and 2016, the same group suggests, more than 33,000 people may have died. “They’ve changed the rules now,” says Kokotajlo. “You are allowed to take various fractions of the component parts of blood. But if you’re in an emergency – a car crash say – that isn’t going to be possible, is it? Your life is still in danger.” He shakes his head. “No, it happens far more often than you realise.”Kokotajlo studied textiles at Manchester politan University, after which he spent several years making a living from painting and hip-hop – and it was in this period, when he was sharing a house with friends, that he discovered film: “I had been looking into my Italian-Ukrainian heritage, which comes from my grandparents, so I was already into Fellini and Pasolini. But when I moved in with those guys, one of them was into British cinema. Until then, it had never crossed my mind that there was such a thing as British cinema outside the mainstream. Mike Leigh, Alan Clark, Anthony Asquith, Terence Rattigan, David Lean… That got me interested. I felt like maybe this was something I could do.”At 27, he left Manchester for a screenwriting MA at Westminster University, a course he funded with his art and a series of bar jobs. Was it helpful? “It was in terms of contacts, moving out of Manchester, and life skills,” he says. “I guess I learned how to communicate with southerners. But then it was a case of: what do I do now?” Eventually, the answer came in the form of a short film called The Mess Hall of an Online Warrior, made for a few hundred quid. “It did quite well at festivals, and I was invited in by Vision Media – the then regional film council – who said they’d fund another one.” It also having done well at festivals, he began developing Apostasy in 2015 by November 2016, shooting was under way. Did he always know his first full-length film would be about the Witnesses? “No, no. no. I worked on a few scripts before it. Maybe I was scared of it. I didn’t want to upset my family.”When did he start to doubt? “It was a very slow process. The first thing I noticed was that I didn’t feel comfortable with the way women were treated. It might have been a wedding ceremony: all the scriptures they were pulling out were about women needing to be capable wives and men being the head of the house they were using lots of very disturbing phrases. Then I went to college, and that was the key, really. People would ask my opinion on something, and I would be scrambling round trying to find an answer in a text somewhere – because that’s what life as a Witness is like. It’s group thinking based on the interpretation of a text. I looked back at the meetings, and I began to see what was going on.”Kokotajlo, who thinks of himself as an agnostic now, attended his last meeting at the Kingdom Hall when he was 22 or 23 his siblings have also since left the church. How does his mother feel about this? “I’m not sure. I still have a good relationship with her. For a long time afterwards, she would still ask me to come back to meetings she still does, sometimes. But Witnesses just expect you to come back: it’s like northerners thinking you’re just going through a silly phase of living in the south.” He laughs. Is it still a part of him, though? Surely it must be. “It is, yes,” he says, softly. “I feel like I’ve dealt with it now, having made the film, but it is still a part of me. You’ve got these ideas and values in life. I’m compassionate. I do my best to listen to people. But it’s a tough one: is that the religion, or is that just how I am?” Does he miss the certainty of belief, or is it liberating to be free of it? “It was liberating when I first left. I remember when I first read Darwin. Wow, I thought. This makes so much more sense than the Bible. But then, when we joined the Witnesses, I felt the same way: there was this key to the universe, and everything was clear. There was an elitism in it. All these idiots around us, we thought: they don’t know. I used to feel quite smug, and maybe I’m still looking for that. Perhaps I want to be part of a cult-like group. When I first left, it was about music. Now it’s film.”How does he feel about Apostasy’s imminent release? “Nervous, excited, proud.” His mother hasn’t seen it, and probably won’t. But at every festival at which it has been screened, he has been touched to see the turnout of supportive ex-Jehovah’s Witnesses. “Some of it is really emotional,” he says. “There have been people who took blood and were then shunned. Even in London, there were people who had been shunned.” As for secular audiences, who will bring to the cinema their own prejudices and misconceptions, perhaps by spending time with Ivanna, they will come to see the world, albeit briefly, through her eyes. Certainly, this is his hope. The squat, bleak, redbrick Kingdom Hall where she worships in the film stands on a dual carriageway, a road that works quite brilliantly as a metaphor, the world zooming past while inside everyone inside sits quite still, waiting for its end. But for all her zealotry, Ivanna is human after all. Her love for her daughters might be horribly muddled, but it is still love, nevertheless.Apostasy is in cinemas on 27 July. Daniel Kokotajlo will also be doing Q\u0026ampAs after select screenings of the film across the UK.

After early hopefuls Germany, Brazil, Argentina and Spain bowed out earlier than expected in the tournament, there remained just one of the original favourites: La France. In Moscow on Sunday night’s final a combative Croatian side, blessed with eventual golden ball winner Luka Modric in midfield, were unable to continue their fairytale as two favourable refereeing decisions set France up for a comfortable victory against the Balkan nation in an engrossing game.Following France’s 4-2 win, its second World Cup victory in two decades, the country’s press all carried photos of captain and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris – who made a dreadful error in the closing stages of the game – holding the trophy aloft.‘Le jour de gloire est arrivé’, the day of glory has arrived, chimed Le Figaro as the French media reacted to the comprehensive victory over underdogs Croatia.Le Journal du Dimanche carried a similar photo on its back page that captured the jubilance of the erse Black, Blanc, Beur French team.The headline Dans les etoilés played on the fact that the proud nation were now two-times world champions and had earned the right to place multiple stars above the French cockerel on their jerseys.Chelsea’s Olivier Giroud, who did not score a goal during the tournament, is seen to have managed to get his hands on the trophy almost as soon as the celebrations had began.The front page, meanwhile, depicted French men and women toasting their success in front of the Arc de Triomphe, beneath a tricolour flag and a headline proclaiming “France wins” the day after Bastille Day.Encore! demanded the left-leaning Libération, as pundits mused on the potential of this young French side which never quite reached its full potential throughout the tournament, yet still won.La Montagne, the French regional paper, paid tribute to Les Tsars in yet another play on the significance of the country’s second World Cup win, in the land of Nicholas and Alexander.Elsewhere, Le Parisien said the French team had their heads in the stars after winning their second World Cup.Kylian Mpabbé, the young player of the tournament and the first teenager to score in a final since Pelé in 1958, is having a cheeky sideways look at the trophy in this one. On his goal he said: “It was a superb goal, especially since it was a goal that gave us wings.”Eternal happiness, gushed sports daily L’Équipe, as it paid tribute to les Bleus of Paul Pogba, Kylian Mbappé and Antoine Griezmann who it said were writing their own legend in the tradition of the 1998 World Cup-winning heroes: that of a team and a country in full communion.‘We love you!’ wrote La Depeche, which featured a photo taken shortly after the French team first lifted the 5kg, 18-carat trophy.Benjamin Pavard, who scored one of the goals of the tournament, is leading the celebrations.Le Monde, the most renowned French daily newspaper, hinted at its front pages.Whether it would choose a widely shared photo of French president Emmanuel Macron’s boisterous celebration with the Croatian president, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, and the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, looking on from their seats to grace its front or back page remained to be seen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/244c78b34be3010b3105b25a1f8da6b3f80323cc/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c71a520da6938c9de7ea8b52c089f8f6","title":"croatia france luka modric","story":"Luka Modric was player of the World Cup but, for all the warrior-like qualities of his teammates, the key borderline decisions went against the nation of four million peopleIvan Perisic has done more than most to ignite Croatia’s World Cup adventure, to carry them into uncharted territory and to allow this small nation with big hearts to dream of the ultimate triumph.The imposing winger gilded his legend with a lovely first-half goal that showcased not only his touch and ruthlessness but the never‑say-die attitude of him and his teammates. Croatia were level at 1-1, they were the better team at that point in the final – around the half-hour – and it was easy to imagine the frenzied scenes back in Zagreb.Fate would then deal the card that broke Perisic and each one of his four million compatriots. When Blaise Matuidi jumped for and missed an Antoine Griezmann corner, Perisic was about a yard behind him and in no position to whip his arm back. The ball‑to‑hand contact was there and when the impassioned French appeals came, the referee, Néstor Pitana, agreed that he ought to have a second look.The slow-motion replays looked bad for Perisic and it became clear what kind of a conclusion Pitana would reach. Griezmann scored the penalty and Croatia could smoulder with injustice. It was a borderline decision and, this time, there would be no way back for Zlatko Dalic and his band of fighters.Didier Deschamps’s team are not in the business of relinquishing leads. They might have done so once but, with the game tailored to their counter-attacking style, they were not going to do so again. They expertly moved it beyond their opponents and, when it was all over, the heartbreak belonged to those in the red-and-white check.Dalic called a huddle of his players, speaking to them from the heart of it and, when they broke, it was to a tremendous ovation from the Croatia supporters behind the goal. There was barely a dry eye, even from the tough guys such as Dejan Lovren.It was impossible not to be moved during the post-match ceremony in which Luka Modric, deservedly, collected the award for player of the tournament.The Croatia captain looked shattered, choked. There would no smiles from him upon an inidual honour.The Croatia fans reserved their fury for Pitana, when the Argentinian went up to collect his medal and there will doubtless be mutterings of conspiracy from them. Why do the small nations find themselves on the wrong side of the big decisions?In the end, though, as the rain lashed down, the golden confetti settled and the fireworks exploded, there could be pride. Dalic and his players had been shadowed during the tournament by the achievements of the Class of 98, the great Croatia team that reached the semi-final of the France World Cup. They had consistently said they would emulate them. They did more than that, tearing down psychological barriers in the process. Not since 1998 had Croatia won a knockout tie at a major tournament.It was a final that pulsed with colour and noise, with the tone set by the pre-match show which featured Will Smith, Ronaldinho banging the samba drums and all sorts of capering about. The energy crackled and even the elements appeared to reinforce the feel of a primal epic. The rain teemed down in bursts while the thunder rumbled and the lightning flashed.Croatia’s progress through the knockout rounds was characterised by slow starts. They conceded early against Denmark and, although they equalised immediately, it took them time to find their stride. Against Russia and England, they were second best in the first half. Not here. Dalic’s players pressed and hustled during a stirring opening and the first concession was a bitter pill.Croatia knew all about France’s set-piece threat. But Mario Mandzukic would wear a crazed kind of expression after Griezmann’s free-kick skimmed off the top of his head and went in while France’s crucial second also had its roots in a deadball. There is no question that Griezmann had bought the free-kick off Marcelo Brozovic for the first. Worse would follow for Croatia.Dalic’s team have thrived in adversity, harnessing a warrior spirit that several of their players have said runs through the country – a product of being forged in war and enduring so many extreme difficulties. National pride has tracked their every move and it has helped them to mine fresh depths of resolve.At no point did their heads drop, even after Kylian Mbappé had made it 4-1, and at no point did they stop pushing. This, remember, was a team who had played extra time in their three previous ties. Perisic’s goal followed his equaliser against England but, this time, there would be no comeback. France would show all of their know‑how and class.The last time that such a small country made it to a World Cup final was Uruguay in 1950 – they defeated Brazil – and there is a reason why Croatia’s population has been a prominent theme. Nations of four million are simply not supposed to punch this strongly.The journey had begun amid crisis last October, when Ante Cacic was replaced by Dalic as qualification hung in the balance. Dalic would win the decisive final tie in Ukraine and then a play-off against Greece before he and his squad clicked in Russia. With Modric and some of his teammates into their 30s, there has been the feeling that it could be now or never for them in terms of football’s greatest prize. There could be no masking the pain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3de6ba77a4ac14b575c2bad2fc93a1e40993e6e/0_0_1924_1154/master/1924.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bba6dda659fd6d15edc63031cf2701e","title":"france boast seductive future with kylian mbappe their leading man","story":"And fade to blue. On a stormy, slightly wild afternoon in Moscow France became world champions for the second time, providing a bookend to one victorious era and offering a seductive hint of another to come.It seemed fitting that victory here was never really in doubt. This despite the attentions of a manically committed Croatia who seemed to be charging after something that just kept moving away, engine purring, geared to a higher rate of frequency.It seemed fitting, too, that the trophy should be handed over in fierce, warm Moscow rain at the end of a startlingly good World Cup, with every player, volunteer and head of state present soaked to the skin – all except for the great Vlad, who showed his eye for the fine details by deploying his personal golf umbrella holder.Above all it was fitting that the most talented team in Russia should take the trophy at a gallop and in a manner that poses some obvious questions.Mainly, how have they done this? And how much better can they get?There was a suggestion of an answer to both of these at the final whistle at the Luzhniki Stadium. As the referee, Néstor Pitana, blew to signify the dawning of the age of Didier an entire team of men who could probably also have won this tournament came sprinting on in formation, howling with joy and hurling themselves into the arms of their fraternal peers.The ages of the reserves running on were salutary: 21, 21, 22, 23, 25, 23.This France squad was the second youngest at the World Cup. And here is the other thing: thanks to the efforts of these academy graduates France can now claim to be the most powerful nation in world football in the past 20 years.Spain’s brilliance was more concentrated and indeed more transformative. But France have appeared in five of the last 11 World Cup and Euro finals, winning three of them. Spain have played three, won three. Germany have played three, won one.For the English it is a roll call of world champs that reads back like a gentle rebuke to any lingering dreams of major nation status: France, Germany, Spain, Italy. The World Cup has now spent the past 12 years and counting in the Schengen Zone, with one nation right at the heart of the project. From Thierry to Kylian: welcome to the age of L’Hexagone.Given their resources there will be some wistful thoughts about France’s style. At the end here there was the tremendously funny sight of Didier Deschamps being given the bumps by his players, still stern and stiff and frowning as he flew high into the air, as though considering bringing on a third defensive midfielder even at the moment of his ultimate personal ascent.Some will suggest that, even when they were scoring four here and in Kazan, this France team never really found its deepest attacking gears. What drove them on was Deschamps’s will, his obsession with shape and team combinations.In Antoine Griezmann’s set‑piece expertise, Paul Pogba’s easy craft and Kylian Mbappé’s extreme qualities of simply being like Kylian Mbappé France had enough controlled fantasy whenever their opponents showed signs of resistance. A brief word here about Mbappé. Blimey. Whoah. Cripes. Actually that is three. But you get the idea.What are we going to do with this kid? He is simply irresistible, not just a pure, brilliantly fearless talent, with a genuine sprinter’s technique that allows him to glide away in the smallest of spaces. He is also a joy to watch, a footballer of real charm and warmth, who still seems to be having the most wonderful time, playing with friends in the middle of all that epic-scale tension.Early on Mbappé played as an auxiliary right‑back. Later he shifted up a gear and became a traumatic prospect for Croatia’s left side, covering the ground like a pond-skater, barely breaking the surface tension. Finally he scored the fourth in France’s 4-2 win, lashing a right‑footed shot low into the corner with casually perfect technique. In between France were never really on top but were still somehow always on top.Croatia had more possession and more shots. France led 2-1 at half-time through an own goal and a debatable VAR penalty.At which point this team pulled itself up to its full height and simply eased away, And so for the second time in a row we have a world champion team from a prosperous western European nation whose progress through the tournament has been a matter of systems-efficiency combined with controlled attacking flair.Deschamps always had a golden ticket here, the greatest harvest of playing talent anywhere, tribute to the depth of the methods and structures of Clairefontaine and its 11 satellite academies.There are other things, too. This is a nation that has always had a wider respect for the academic and the scholarly, and where even football coaches are promoted on the basis of intellect and methods, with little trace of the “practical man” template the idea that only playing the game can confer authority.The world has moved towards the French here. Elite football is increasingly a matter of prep and method and planning, the ability of players to learn and adapt and make their own decisions.France showed these qualities right through this tournament, keeping to their structures, always seeming to have an extra gear. Even the most grating cliches often turn out to have a perverse kind of truth. And perhaps football really did come home at a World Cup won by the cradle of current European talent and by a nation that gave us this fun, thrilling, enduringly fine global beano in the first place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fcf841983ebfc3e6810f688d65136a56e0571a8/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8107caa0f02a5172a5d40f5088f742fc","title":"france croatia world cup final match report","story":"When the decisive blows arrived the entire squad piled on top of one another in the victory scrum. Hugo Lloris, the goalkeeper, had run the entire length of the pitch to join in the celebrations. All the substitutes were throwing themselves into this heap of arms and legs. There were even members of the backroom staff contemplating joining in, and who could blame them? France were on their way to winning the World Cup and a party was under way behind the goal where the tricolours were fluttering.Those were the moments when everybody knew that no side – not even one with Croatia’s resilience and powers of durability – would find a way back. Paul Pogba and Kylian Mbappé had scored in quick succession and the next edition of the France national shirt will have two stars, rather than one, above the cockerel.Didier Deschamps has become only the third man in history to win the World Cup as a player and manager, standing alongside two giants of the game in Mário Zagallo and Franz Beckenbauer. Mbappé is a world champion at the age of 19, the first teenager to score in a final since Pelé in 1958, and there were jubilant scenes after the final whistle as the players gave their manager the bumps as the rain turned biblical and the trophy was lifted to a backdrop of thunder and slate skies.The mistake from Lloris that allowed Mario Mandzukic to pull a goal back for Croatia did not matter greatly in the end and France are deserving champions bearing in mind their assured performances throughout the tournament. Any team that score four times in a final are entitled to feel they have won in style and nobody seemed to mind too much, in the long wait for the trophy presentation, that the only person being sheltered from the rain was Vladimir Putin. Kudos to the chap in the suit who suddenly appeared with an umbrella to keep the president dry while Gianni Infantino and the other assorted Fifa dignitaries took a soaking.This was the highest-scoring final since 1966 and it was laced with drama and incident, not least a second-half pitch invasion apparently from members of Pussy Riot, and featuring a fair amount of controversy, too, bearing in mind that France’s second goal, a penalty scored by Antoine Griezmann, came from a borderline VAR decision that will always polarise opinion.Even before that point it was difficult not to sympathise with Croatia given they had suffered the grievous setback of an own goal from Mandzukic. Zlatko Dalic, the Croatia manager, had promised that, if necessary, his team would take defeat with dignity and at least his players did not veer from that line, in trying circumstances. They will leave Russia, however, feeling that key moments of luck went against them, right down to the smaller details. Marcelo Brozovic’s alleged foul on Griezmann for the free-kick that led to Mandzukic’s own goal was a case in point: a generous decision, to say the least.That was the 53rd own goal in the history of the World Cup, going all the way back to a Mexican player, Manuel Rosas, doing the same against Chile in 1930. Nobody, however, had ever done it before in a final and presumably Rosas did not have to suffer the indignity, as Mandzukic did here, of the public announcer making sure everyone knew who had applied the decisive touch. Mandzukic’s attempt to help out in defence had gone horribly wrong. The ball had skimmed off his head from Griezmann’s free-kick and France were ahead before any of their own players had managed an attempt at goal.By now everyone should know enough about Croatia not to be taken aback by the strength of their response, culminating in a beautifully taken equaliser from Ivan Perisic 10 minutes later, using that precious left foot to fire a low, diagonal shot through a congested penalty area.All this was rather unexpected bearing in mind the previous seven finals had yielded only four first-half goals between them. Yet it had quickly become clear that a thrilling tournament was not going to be let down by a cagey, prosaic final and the only pity, perhaps, went back to the first-half incident that led Croatia’s fans to whistle noisily when the match officials collected their medals.It certainly was not a straightforward decision for the Argentinian referee, Néstor Pitana, and the length of time he spent analysing the replays told its own story. Eventually the handball decision was given against Perisic because it could be argued his arm was sticking out at an unnatural angle as he stooped behind Blaise Matuidi to defend a corner.Was Matuidi’s flick-on on target or heading towards a teammate? The answer is no to both questions. But maybe that was deemed irrelevant. The ball did strike Perisic’s hand, however little he knew about it, and that was enough for the penalty to be awarded, no matter how tough that might seem. Griezmann held his nerve to guide the penalty past Danijel Subasic, the Croatia goalkeeper, and after nearly four minutes of arguments and counter-arguments France were back in front.The game was still finely poised until Mbappé and Griezmann combined to set up Pogba to make it 3-1 just before the hour. Pogba’s first effort came back to him off a defender. The second was a more controlled finish with his left foot to wrong-foot Subasic and, when Mbappé fired in a low 25-yard effort for France’s fourth goal six minutes later, it was starting to feel as if it could be a rout.Instead Lloris tried to dribble past Mandzukic in his own six-yard area, made a pig’s ear of it and at least that gave the score a bit more respectability from a Croatian perspective. There were 20 minutes to play and the losing players kept pushing forward, trying to pull off an improbable feat of escapology. Luka Modric demonstrated why he would later be announced as the Golden Ball winner, as the tournament’s outstanding player, and an argument could legitimately be made that Croatia matched their opponents in everything but goals. Dalic’s team had set off as though affronted that France were viewed as favourites.Deschamps had substituted N’Golo Kanté, France’s midfield shield, early in the second half, mindful that the Chelsea player had been booked, but there were only fleeting moments when their opponents threatened to examine whether Lloris might be vulnerable again.

The 24-year-old scored six goals at Russia 2018, holding off competition from Belgium’s Romelu Lukaku and France’s Kylian Mbappé among others to win the trophy.Kane scored five of his six goals in the group stages, including a hat-trick in England’s 6-1 rout of Panama. He said that after the disappointment of Euro 2016, when he failed to score and the team crashed out against Iceland, it was a welcome tonic.“I said before coming into this tournament that I wanted to prove I could do it on these stages,” Kane said. “The Euros were disappointing. If anything I wanted to prove to myself I could score at this level. I’ve scored at every other level and it was important I did that.“I’m extremely proud and I’m sure I’ll look back in a few weeks’ time and take all these experiences in. It’s hard to do that now because we are still disappointed.”The award puts Kane in exalted company, with Eusébio, Garrincha and the Brazilian Ronaldo among the previous winners of the Golden Boot. He demonstrated a lethal instinct in front of goal in England’s opening game against Tunisia with two goals including a stoppage-time header which played a vital part in the team advancing from the group.Two of his goals against Panama came from penalties as the Central American side were punished for ill discipline and a third deflected in off his heel following a Ruben Loftus‑Cheek strike.Kane expressed disappointment he was not able to score in England’s final three games but was celebrating the achievement. “It’s been a fantastic campaign for me personally and the team as well,” the England captain said. “But there’s still stuff I can improve on. Obviously I can get better.“I feel like there have been games in this tournament when I could have done better but that’s all part of the learning curve.”Kane has flown home but expects Fifa to send the trophy to him. He will store it at his home in London alongside his two Premier League golden boot accolades from the 2015-16 and 2016-17 seasons. “It will go with the other two, the Premier League ones,” he said. “It’s a big achievement. Not many people get to say they’ve won a Golden Boot at a World Cup. I’m sure they’ll send it to me in a nice secure package.”Meanwhile John Stones says he will watch England’s seven games in Russia back in full. The Manchester City defender was one of England’s standout performers and was singled out for praise by Gareth Southgate after his performance against Belgium in the third-place play-off. But he was in a self-analytical mood afterwards, reflecting on his header which was saved in extra time in the semi-final against Croatia as well as allowing Mario Mandzukic to sneak in behind him for the winner.“I could have done better in a lot of things,” he said. “If that header against Croatia had been two feet closer – things like that. In any situation, making a misplaced pass, it’s difficult because if you make a misplaced pass teams are so good now they invariably punish you, so you study everything little thing.“Look at Belgium,” he said. “Their counterattacking was frightening at times. I wouldn’t like to come up against that every week. I am self-critical but I don’t want to be too negative about the whole tournament. There are ifs and buts in any field of life. We should be so positive after this experience. How we have been is the way forward for England. We will take all the good things out of it. Everyone has enjoyed it, coming up against teams who are not easy to play against.“We never underestimated anyone and knew that every team had their own qualities,” he added. “Some were defensively solid, others had a great set piece in the main we dealt with those moments. We set a lot of markers and should be really proud of that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f81ce8f271433070897658577a94ec644483c82/145_349_3012_1807/master/3012.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edd30234fe071008d0ab87f250091530","title":"world cup final best photos france win over croatia","story":"Our pick of the best images from Moscow as France beat Croatia 4-2 in the tournament decider"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc0073ae6d89858ae8f28f4082fe9cf63f8314e7/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4823aa293b457f603de5ae7e9c337bd8","title":"golden boot standings top scorers for russia 2018 world cup","story":"The first official Fifa World Cup award for the player to score the most goals in the competition went to Paolo Rossi in 1982.

The Golden Shoe now usually refers to the top scorer in Europe across all club competitions.The Golden Boot goes to the player credited with the most goals (not including own goals, since you ask). If there is a tie, the award goes to the player with the most assists. If there is still a tie, the winner is the player who played the fewest minutes - that is to say, the player with most goals per minutes played. The second- and third-placed players are given the Silver and Bronze Boot respectively.In 2010, Thomas Müller, David Villa, Wesley Sneijder and Diego Forlán were tied on five goals. Müller won on the basis of assists, with the others ranked on the basis of minutes played. This meant that Forlán, in fourth place, got nothing, and had to console himself with the Golden Ball for the best player of the tournament.

A few benches outside offer views down to Porthcurnick beach and across the water.Run by the husband-and-wife team Simon Stallard and Jemma Glass, who is a third-generation Portscatho local, it’s a cafe during the day, serving freshly baked Cornish pasties, soups, cakes (made by Jemma’s mum, Maggie) and lunchtime specials, ranging from tagine to seafood chowder.In the evening, it’s transformed, with feast nights turning the hut into a culinary destination that attracts diners from far afield (Stallard published the first Hidden Hut cookbook earlier this year, too).“The feast nights are very outdoorsy and there’s not much polish – hopefully, the food is the champion,” says Stallard of the events that began with an impromptu barbecue intended to use up some fish. A casually placed chalkboard by the road and word of mouth led to bigger things, though each feast still focuses on just one dish, whether that’s freshly landed local mackerel, or the grilled bone-in sirloin steak from their own cattle. (There are always vegetarian options and some evenings, such as the south Indian vegetable thali event, inspired by Stallard’s travels, are meat-free.)Prices for the feast nights, which run from March to October, vary from £13 for the seafood paella to £25 for the most popular evening: lobster and chips.Stallard’s not being modest about the Hut’s informality, with 60 to 100 diners bringing their own cutlery, crockery and drinks. Seating is on communal benches or the camping chairs some bring tucked under their arms.Feasts go ahead in all weathers. Although a nice summer’s evening can boast dramatic sunsets and the chance to spot dolphins in the bay, it is the colder nights, when diners huddle up together, hot water bottles in their laps, tucking into a plate of hot food, that Stallard thinks are the most memorable.In 2017, more than 22,000 people applied for just 600 covers over their summer season. How has the ever-growing popularity changed this remote hut with its open-air feasts?“The hut is still the same size,” jokes Stallard. “Our focus hasn’t changed. It’s always been on the food.” ASThe Hidden Hut is out now (HarperCollins, £20) hiddenhutIt’s a world-class art gallery with a thousand-acre farm. It’s a famous garden and a serious restaurant, with its own Henry Moore lobster on the wall. The cooking at the Roth Bar \u0026amp Grill at Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, Somerset, is run out of converted cowsheds by Steve and Jules Horrell, with a bar by Björn and Oddur Roth, son and grandson of artist Dieter Roth: all scavenged woods and stuff, just like granddad’s work.More lists: there is a Himalayan salt room for ageing meat from animals born and bred on the farm. There are free-range mangalitsa pigs Angus, Hereford and wagyu-cross cows sheep gambol through fields before being turned into suckling-lamb chops or merguez sausages served North-African style, with harissa and beans. They even have a vineyard.It is so bucolic you could almost hate it, were it not (almost) integrated into the community. There is a village summer party, a pumpkin festival, a field has been given over to local allotments. Art is, of course, central. The galleries currently house an Alexander Calder retrospective, with a massive mobile and free-standing metalworks punctuating the outside space. There is the re-homed Serpentine Pavilion by Smiljan Radić, plonked at the end of the garden like a 1950s UFO (the design, btw, is by superstar plantsman Piet Oudolf, currently planning the outside space at the new Noma in Copenhagen).But, truthfully, the Horrells don’t need any of this to make the Roth Bar \u0026amp Grill work. Yes, happily, much of the produce comes from local farmers, gardens and gamekeepers, but it is the cooking you will come back for. Full of bold flavours and ideas, I would drive a long way for the food, with or without the arty accoutrements, though I like the setting, the room and much of the artworks on the walls. “Steve’s cooking is all about the theatre and my part is the table setting and styling,” says Jules.My current obsession is their Francis Mallmann-inspired metal cage and fire pit – they do “fire feasts” on Thursdays – with heavy iron kit, reminiscent of the Inquisition. “There is no better way to cook than lighting the fire for an asado just as dawn strikes,” says Steve. “All you can hear is bird song and the crackling of flames. Once we have the fire going and the lamb is on, we sit fireside and grill home-cured bacon and eggs from the farm. We never let the weather stop us – we have cooked for parties in rain and snow.” So, I will return for a Thursday evening (I have an eye on the fish stew fire feast on 9 August). Or maybe make an extravagant detour for lunch, if passing within 50 miles. AJrothbarandgrillRiver Exe Cafe is like very few other restaurants. Built on the reclaimed hulls of two defunct canal barges, it sits in the middle of the wide tidal estuary between Exmouth and Starcross. Customers must take the water taxi from Exmouth Marina. “You need to come with a sense of adventure,” says co-owner David Foa. “The cafe does move a bit when boats go past.”Foa and his business partner, Paul Craven, opened the cafe in 2011. Foa wanted a clubhouse for his wakeboard and water-ski school, while Craven wanted to open a cafe. Now, it has six people in the kitchen and up to eight front of house.Seafood is, unsurprisingly, a priority here. Foa says the big seafood platters are a bestseller – with crab, prawns, white-fish ceviche, scallops and clams at £60 – but you can also go for whole Brixham crab, or mussels served six ways. “We buy off the local fish supplier in Exmouth,” says Foa. “He goes to Brixham market every morning, so it’s straight to plate.”Fish delivery isn’t the only thing that has to be negotiated daily. Everything that comes to the cafe – “every bottle top, every tissue” – has to go back. “Our poo boat, called Winnie the Pooh, does a run every day.” With no pipes or power lines, water has to be shipped over and electricity is from a generator.To complicate matters further, the seasonality of the cafe (it closes from the end of September until April) makes “finding the right people, and holding on to them, very difficult,” says Foa. So what makes it all worthwhile? He laughs. “Just getting to the end of the season feels like an achievement.” He relents a little. “Having happy customers in is nice, too. We seem to be doing OK.” KFriverexecafeThere are restaurants on boats, swung from cranes, in car parks and deconsecrated churches, so we shouldn’t really have a problem with a great restaurant on a caravan site in North Wales, should we? Marram Grass is exactly that, a comfortably sized former shed that brothers Ellis and Liam Barrie have taken over on their parents’ holiday park in Anglesey.When they began in 2011, chef Ellis was knocking out fry-ups, while Liam, who trained as a surveyor, was front of house, wrangling the holiday-makers. I know. In a world where every new launch seems to come from two chaps who quit their City jobs to ride their “dining concept” to financial triumph, a couple of blokes knocking out bacon baps to caravanning families sounds fantastic, doesn’t it?But here’s the thing. They got it right. Very right. They decided early on that they’d stick with local suppliers and continue to accommodate local customers and, when I made the trek to review them, I found they were turning out incredibly high-quality dishes (Marram made the Good Food Guide in 2015). I remember kingly fresh mussels from the Menai Strait, spectacular local plaice in caper butter, and a mad “deconstructed cream tea” for dessert. It was disorientating. Such quality and skill, yet with a cheery informality and, Christ, such huge portions. They’ve kept it up, too, working on the menu, winning awards, finding new suppliers and developing old ones, and announcing a very “non-caravan-site” guesthouse. What success can’t alter, though, is the integrity of the food, the endearing room and the lovely crew.As Ellis explains: “The Marram Grass ties so much into the location because it has evolved as a business alongside us, tucked away on Anglesey. Farmers that we talked to as customers became suppliers. The kids of our customers were the people asking for work experience and jobs – the beginnings of a team.”Michelin may never visit a shed but you certainly should. Marram Grass is one of a kind: a big-hearted combination of a spectacular local caff with splashes of fine-dining refinement and enough witty MasterChef touches to please the crowds it now attracts from all over the country. Not a day goes by when Adam Riley doesn’t wonder what he’s doing, serving seafood from a converted shipping container on a Tyneside beach. But then the winds drop, the crowds come and it all makes sense. “The advantage of a business like this is you get to do what you want,” Riley says. “We’re not part of a high street, so we can be flamboyant and different.”Riley’s Fish Shack, garlanded with fairy lights, smoke spiralling from its chimney, is certainly that. Riley trained as a chef on the Isle of Man, but went into theatre when he moved to Tynemouth. The shack started life as a mobile barbecue for the Tynemouth food festival in 2012, built out of bicycle parts he had left over from a street art project in Derby. As to the choice of the beach, a serious stagger down the steep path from the road above: “I always wanted to open somewhere that was quiet, so you could create your own atmosphere, and this has long been my favourite beach. It has a calm, tranquil feel.”The barbecue cart was replaced by the container with its wood-fired oven. Soon there were queues, aided by ecstatic reviews, not least from this newspaper. “I like to exceed expectations. People think they’re coming for a bit of mackerel and then they get a lot more.” Indeed they do: there’s wood-fired lobsters and empanadas stuffed full of long-stewed beef and oysters, all of it served in wooden boxes. You perch on rickety stools at a rough wooden bar, looking out to the North Sea, and all is good.It’s not always easy, not least because Riley insists on staying open all year round. “During the beast from the east, the winds kept blowing bits off,” he says. “But we only lost three days to the snow.” He’s regularly asked to open more shacks, but he’s not convinced. “I’m responsible for sourcing all the fish as ethically as possible and, if we had another shack, we’d need another me.” He may open a wet fish shop with a cafe. “I think the chefs would like the chance to use real plates.” But he’s not planning an empire. He has his shack on the beach with a view of the sea, and that’s all he’s ever really wanted.

Honestly, please give me two minutes to talk about the school holidays. Because I’m new to it, see, from this angle at least. Of course, I remember it from the other side, those gloriously boring deserts of time that stretched from July to infinity and took in almost 4,000 screaming rows and a number of own-brand Calippos.In the early days of my now desiccated memory there are trips to Cornwall and long car journeys listening to Uncle Johnny’s Party Tape TM with its tight edit of Motown and Leonard Cohen (“Why do we have to listen to rabbi music?” I once whined), and there are also whole days down at the brook, banking our 5ps for a bottle of Tango. Then in later years, a slow promenade around Brent Cross, our local, well, now I suppose we’d call it a mall with no embarrassment? It was the first place we were allowed to go without adults, and we relished these hours gliding over its mezzanines of brutalist capitalism, these tuna sandwiches eaten like grown-ups, dangling our legs in the indoor fountain.Scrolling online through photos of the polished interior from the 80s and 90s, with its bemused wooden animals standing guard outside Fenwick, was so overwhelmingly nostalgic that I had to sit down for a moment. I’m not alone – on Vimeo, over footage shot when ascending the escalator in 1992, someone’s composed a soundtrack “attempting to recreate from memory the sound of Brent Cross shopping-centre”, woozy organs against the rush of that fountain. That was the sound of the summer holidays, but no more. Nope.The reality of a month and a half without school or nursery, when half of our potentially child-caring family members are away yet full-time work selfishly insists on continuing as normal, well, it’s been quite a surprise. This is the bit that you must bear with, because I know, even as I type it, that these are the brand of conversations you will actively spin away from at parties, the kind used later to illustrate how boring your friends have become. But it has thrown me, this problem suddenly appearing in my lap like a bat flapping through a window during breakfast – it is shocking, and stupid, and inevitably, because of my stained personality, I can draw a direct line from this to the subjugation of women.Because it seems to me to be another sharp nail in the coffin of women’s careers. I know that it is not always women who carry the weight of flexibility and organising care – #notallwomen etc – but having frantically asked everyone with young children I’ve encountered over the past fortnight, it has without exception been the mother who has sighingly explained how they sort out the swimming camps, the drop-offs, the timetabling of holidays, the calling in of favours from neighbours and friends. Unless they don’t have a job – which itself is usually an unchoice made around the time they gave birth (and, call me cynical, seemingly a totally sane reaction to the impossibility of having it all) – then it is their career that suffers, picked away at by the beak of necessity. And their relationship, too – if they’re in a couple, the family will never holiday together, as the parents will each use their allocated days to be with the children, while enacting a complicated dance around the wall-calendar with their colleagues.The standard holiday entitlement is 5.6 weeks – the school summer holidays alone are six weeks long. Even in term time, school finishes at about 3.30pm work, as a rule, finishes at 5pm. I was in the bottom group of maths, but even I can see something doesn’t add up here.We’re bringing up children in a pound-shop system – there are missing pieces, what’s there is made of bad plastic that breaks on impact, and where the engine should be there’s a box of bees. Working doesn’t work. Nannies, au-pairs, pssh, even if my generation of parents had the money we certainly do not have the spare bedrooms. Does this sound ranty? Petty? To me, new to all this and very bad at admin, it feels like a symptom of something, another thing, very broken. And apart from grand and decisive action from above, like a proper restructuring of the ways we work, or making childcare more affordable, I really can’t see a solution.For the foreseeable future, the sound of the summer holidays for me will no longer be that dreamlike buzz of an air-conditioned shopping centre, instead the screaming of an online diary reminder against a low-level hum of anxiety, spiked with operatic moments of rage. I’ve looked behind the curtain of the summer holiday myth, and found an awful lot of dust.I haven’t identified so strongly with anything as I recently did with the bin lorry that became stuck in Berkshire as roads across the country melted in the heatwave. I am that bin lorry, its wheels sunk into the oozing black, emanating a stench made worse by the sun, unglamorous and overcome by heat.As the NHS turned 70, people shared their stories online of the many times it had saved their lives. And the effect, for me, was a grim sort of awakening, seeing how many people I know had been suffering in so many varied, frightening ways. Through it all, knowing they could rely on our underpaid, overworked, beautiful NHS.A man found two plastic bags left behind in a loft, and, as he documented on Twitter, they contained a trove of historic LGBTQI+ pin badges. He took the collection to Gay’s The Word bookshop in London, where they’ll be displayed.

Bookmakers and online casino companies enjoyed one and a half times as much screen time as alcohol firms and almost four times that of fast food outlets.A government review of gambling regulation published earlier this year shied away from suggesting curbs on gambling adverts, citing insufficient evidence that adverts for betting were causing harm to children and vulnerable people.But Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, and the charity GambleAware said this was partly due to a lack of funding for research into gambling adverts since they were deregulated in 2007, under Tony Blair’s government.“One of the only downsides to this brilliant World Cup has been the bombardment of gambling advertising on TV and social media that thousands of children will have been exposed to,” said Watson. “With an estimated 25,000 children under 16 addicted to gambling, there is nowhere near enough work being done to study the effects of this advertising. “Instead of confronting this issue in the most recent gambling review, the government has turned a blind eye. In doing so they’ve let our children down.”Watson added that Labour would impose a mandatory levy on the industry to fund increased research, education and treatment of gambling addiction and the effects of advertising.It has only recently commissioned the first major piece of research, conducted by the University of Stirling and Ipsos Mori, into the effects of gambling ads being deregulated more than 10 years ago. The studies are not due to be complete until next year.The GambleAware chief executive, Marc Etches, said: “In the absence of evidence, the concern is that this is an adult activity and young people are growing up with it being normalised.Fiona Dobbie, who is leading the University of Stirling’s research into gambling ads, said the study would analyse the response of children and other vulnerable groups to marketing.“This is very much a starting point and we hope it will make a positive contribution to future legislation and policy to protect children from gambling-related harm,” she said.According to ITV, nearly 30 million people watched England’s semi-final clash with Croatia. This increased the cost of gambling advertising on the channel because it allowed companies to reach so many people.Advertising industry sources said a 30-second spot during the semi-final of the World Cup could cost as much as £350,000 but that bookmakers and online casinos were paying a premium to secure blanket coverage. analysed more than 1,300 adverts that were shown around the first 30 games shown by ITV in the competition. Of those, 172 were betting adverts or one in eight commercials. Excluding the sponsored adverts shown at the beginning and end of each break, betting accounted for one in six adverts shown during the broadcaster’s World Cup coverage.The Advertising Standards Authority said it had received 115 complaints about World Cup gambling adverts, mostly about their sheer volume, compared with just 27 in the previous month.The regulator is also examining several adverts that offer improved odds for a short period, to see if they contravene new guidance in the advertising code of practice that bars companies from making urgent calls to action.In the UK, gambling companies are only permitted to advertise before the 9pm watershed if they do so during live sporting events.The stipulation is in stark contrast to the law in Australia, where gambling adverts attached to live sports were banned earlier this year.Methodology:  recorded the duration of every advertisement shown during ITV’s World Cup coverage, specifically, the ad break prior to and after the national anthems, the two half-time ad breaks and that directly after the game ending.

And in its shadow, here we are too.Welcome to another mob-handed, obsessively planned, lovingly curated effort to bring you the  and Observer’s World Cup coverage in every conceivable form, to your every conceivable screen. This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business. Asking our readers to become subscribers, or to contribute to pay for something they value is, in our opinion, the best way forward. So if you like this stuff and think it’s worth helping it to continue, then why not make an additional contribution to the . It only takes a minute and can be as little as £1 if you’re particularly tight or shameless. Yes, sport can be seen as a glorious irrelevance, but it also says something about who we are.

Perhaps it lights up your enjoyment via the frankly brilliant reporting of our football hacks, led of course (damn him) by annual award hoover Danny Taylor, and backed up by the likes of Dominic Fifield, Martha Kelner, Dave Hytner, Stuart James and, with the long range heavy artillery, the mind bogglingly good Marina Hyde.

Those options are still available to you, but as a result of the relaxation of the rules about the sale of interest-only mortgages by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), there has been a growing number of specialist “later life” lenders offering both interest-only and repayment mortgages to older borrowers excluded by mainstream lenders because of their age.

He detailed his insecurities on last year’s album Revival, using opener Walk on Water to bemoan critical snobbery and his own failure to recapture the magic of his early work. On stage this evening – the first of two nights at Twickenham stadium – his low self-esteem initially seems writ large.It’s not news that nowadays Marshall Mathers cuts a very different figure from his dungaree-wearing, chainsaw-wielding Slim Shady persona. But it’s still a shock to see how anonymous this one-time master of aesthetic provocation now looks, like your average middle-aged hip-hop connoisseur in a dense, dark beard and Pete Rock and CL Smooth T-shirt. Wiry and hunched, his apologetic body language makes it even harder to believe he was once that blond, blue-eyed millennial hellion.It might make more sense if Eminem was washed up, but he’s not. Clearly, his artistic relevance is not what it was – not unusual for a musician 22 years into their career – but he’s still a commercial beast. His record-breaking early days might be nigh-on impossible to live up to (he was the biggest-selling artist of the 00s), but his last eight albums have all reached No 1 on both sides of the Atlantic, while Revival attracted some of the biggest musicians on the planet as guest stars, including Beyoncé and Ed Sheeran. Most importantly, however, Mathers has a back catalogue that great swaths of the population still invest with huge amounts of meaning. He knows that: Walk on Water ends with a wink and a boast that “me and you are not alike – bitch, I wrote Stan”. Tonight, he performs the latter with help from the chameleonic singer Skylar Grey (as well as Dido, she subs in for Rihanna and Beyoncé), but, unlike on the unbearably tense recording, the song’s gut punch of murky sadness doesn’t quite land. A breakneck energy – hype man Mr Porter, ex of rap crew D12, does all the heavy lifting mood-wise – and a setlist that is spoilt for choice (it’s a disappointment when Sing for the Moment is prematurely concluded) means the show never suffers from a dip in momentum. It’s so scrupulously entertaining that there’s little time to simply gaze on the ghost of Eminem. While his nasal flow is still technically jaw-dropping – especially on Rap God (a Guinness world record-breaker for the number of words in its lyrics) and the incandescent The Way I Am – gone is any semblance of swagger or attitude, or even humour. Guest stars such as 2 Chainz easily upstage him, and as soon as 50 Cent and his glowing teeth appear to perform a growling rendition of In Da Club, it’s difficult to remember this is supposed to be an Eminem show at all. In the second half, Eminem recovers some of his verve: the depressing Love the Way You Lie seems to perk him up for some reason, while an electric medley of his most brattish early hits – Without Me, My Name Is, The Real Slim Shady – proves he can still tap into that deviant energy when he wants to. For such a stunningly successful artist, Eminem is relatively inexperienced as a performer – he embarked on his maiden solo tour only in 2010, and his intercontinental jaunts tend to be relatively brief. Perhaps that’s the reason he struggles to translate his on-record charisma to a live arena. Or maybe Eminem, the 45-year-old former enfant terrible, is still feeling his way into the second act of his career. For now, it’s clear he hasn’t worked out a way to age disgracefully – or with much of his old self in tact at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79ec5c8d134736e2cc63ed0585a6b85bb5b79abf/0_15_3572_2144/master/3572.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9fa1a9f5444971a348f94c6ff9d4af9","title":"matt cain on madonna homophobic interviewers gay culture","story":"The author and former editor-in-chief of Attitude magazine on how Madonna changed his life• Madonna at 60 by Barbara Ellen: ‘Popular culture still reeks of her influence’Madonna was a radical, brilliant pop icon who changed so many people’s lives. Mine included. I grew up in Bolton in the 1980s, at a time when no one wanted to say anything positive about gay people. If we were represented in the media, it was as disease-carrying sexual predators who couldn’t be trusted around children. The idea of gay role models didn’t even exist. And then along came Madonna.I first became aware of her around the time Like a Virgin was released in 1984, and felt myself being drawn in, but I resisted. I’d been conditioned to be mistrustful of transgressive, rebellious women who expressed their sexuality. By the time the True Blue album came out in 1986 – I was 11 – I was starting to realise I was gay. And that made me sexually transgressive too.Then came the Open Your Heart video. In it, Madonna played a stripper dancing in a venue for an audience that included a lesbian drag king and two gay sailors locked in an affectionate embrace. The thing about her that had been my point of contention suddenly became a point of connection. After that, I didn’t just enjoy Madonna’s work: she became like a spirit guide.People forget the role Madonna played in opening up gay culture to the mainstream. She wasn’t gay herself, but from the beginning she talked about how gay people were part of her life: her gay mentor, her dance teacher, Christopher Flynn the artists and photographers she hung around with like Keith Haring and Herb Ritts the gay dancers she paraded around so proudly in the film In Bed With Madonna. You cannot imagine what it was like to witness her doing that when you were being mercilessly bullied about your sexuality at school, as I was. This was when George Michael, Freddie Mercury and the Pet Shop Boys didn’t dare to come out.Nowadays, online, it’s easy to know that there are other people like you in the world. But in the 1980s, you existed in your own bubble. This was also the time of Aids emerging. The album Like a Prayer came with a copy of a handwritten note from Madonna – I remember so clearly opening it, and how tenderly it was worded, declaring that everyone with Aids deserved respect and compassion, “regardless of their sexual orientation”. Madonna was accused in TV interviews at the time of being irresponsible because of her support for gay culture – you can still see clips of this on YouTube. But she ripped into homophobic interviewers with such ferocity, like a lioness protecting her cubs. It had an incredible impact on me.Before Madonna, it felt like all gay icons had been tragic figures. And yes, Madonna had endured great tragedy in her life – her mother died when she was five – but you never saw an ounce of fragility in her. Think of her in that Jean Paul Gaultier basque – it was like a suit of armour. She was all steely defiance and I wanted to channel this to get through the challenges life was throwing at me.I started to write a novel about growing up gay back in 2006, but it didn’t start working as an idea until I added Madonna. I travelled to Argentina, working as a producer on The South Bank Show. I was recognising so many locations from Evita and couldn’t get the film’s soundtrack out of my head. It dawned on me that Madonna had been with me all my life. There’s a lot that’s different to my own life in my novel, but a chapter about the protagonist, Charlie, going to see Madonna in her first ever UK concert in Leeds in 1987 is one of the most autobiographical. I remember watching in awe as my idol performed a show that was all about self-respect and standing up for your self. I was blown awayWhen people think about 1980s pop icons, they often think of those who’ve gone: Prince, Whitney, Michael Jackson. They often forget about Madonna, the only one that’s survived – and they continue to mock her, not just for being a sexually confident woman but for one who’s dared to get older and continue to produce work.But I love how Madonna’s never wanted to be seen as a nostalgia artist and how in recent years she’s become even more politically outspoken. Her speech at the Billboard women in music awards in 2016 she called out the “blatant sexism and misogyny and constant bullying and relentless abuse” she’d experienced as a woman in the music industry. So many people have relied on Madonna’s music for emotional support in their lives and I’m so glad she’s still here, still expressing herself, absolutely on her own terms. Because if she hadn’t been doing that when I was younger, I’m not sure I’d be here now – and I certainly wouldn’t be the person I am today.The Madonna of Bolton by Matt Cain is out now (Unbound £14.99).

As it passes, sparks can be seen around a parked car in a driveway and then black smoke.The home of prominent republican Bobby Storey in west Belfast was also attacked.No one was hurt in either of the incidents, which took place just after 9.30pm on Friday. The CCTV footage has been shared with detectives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which is investigating.The PSNI said officers seized “remnants of large industrial, firework-type devices, capable of causing serious damage or injury” at two houses in west Belfast.Significant damage was visible to a vehicle on Adams’s driveway in the aftermath of the attack. On Saturday, Adams said he did not know who was responsible for the attacks, but thought there may be a connection with the recent disorder in Derry.He challenged those behind the attacks to him and explain themselves. “For those who were involved in the attack, if they have the gumption to sneak up on our homes, I’d like them or their representatives to come and meet me,” he said.“I’d like them to sit down and explain to me what this is about. I’d like those who are involved in exploiting children in Derry to do the same thing, or those who are poisoning the atmosphere in east Belfast and causing havoc to do the same thing.”He said he can be contacted through any Sinn Féin office, adding: “So that’s my direct appeal to them. Come and sit down and explain to me what this is about. Give us the rationale for this action.”A solidarity rally is being held on Monday evening at the site of the former Andersonstown police station in west Belfast for the families of Adams and Storey. It is also being held for the people of Derry who last week endured six consecutive nights of disorder.Sinn Féin president, Mary Lou McDonald, will be the main speaker at the rally which will also be attended by Adams and Storey.West Belfast Sinn Féin MLA (member of the legislative assembly) Pat Sheehan deplored the attacks as “cowardly and reprehensible”.“Those involved are opposed to the peace process and the process of change,” he said. “Monday night’s rally is an opportunity for the people of Belfast to come out to show solidarity with the families of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey and the people of the Bogside in Derry and send a message to those involved in attacks on republicans and on the community to stop immediately,” he said.Friday’s attacks in west Belfast came after six successive nights of dissident-orchestrated violence in the republican Bogside neighbourhood of Derry.Sinn Féin leaders, including McDonald, were scathing in the criticism of the extremists behind the rioting and attacks on police.

They reported it to Historic England who commissioned Wessex Archaeology to investigate. Trenches dug along the sides have revealed well preserved curved hull timbers.Archaeologists are hoping to recover evidence for the cargo and possessions of the crew, but initial results of dendrochronology and other tests suggest the tree which supplied one oak plank was felled in 1531, and a possible 16th-century date for other elm, larch and beech timbers.The ship is believed to be a single-masted, carvel-built merchant ship of up to 200 tons, precious because the humble working vessels of shipping history are far less likely to survive than gorgeously carved state barges. It may have been carrying copperas, also known as green vitriol – hydrated ferrous sulphate – extensively used as a dye fixative to make ink and known to have been produced around Whitstable from 1565.Mike Harrison, director of Timescapes, a local history group, said: “Our group of volunteers was looking for exploded world war two pillboxes along the Kent coast. Adjacent to a lump of exploded concrete, we were amazed to see the timbers of a ship appearing out of the sand. “We reported the find to Historic England and are pleased that what turned out to be a medieval wreck has been given protection and that this excavation could tell us more about its story.”The Camber Sands wreck was reported by a member of the public who first saw a single stump of timber showing at low tides, but in autumn 2016 realised the outline of a ship was emerging. It is gradually being scoured free of the silt which protected the heavily built vessel 47.2 metres long by 9.5 metres wide, lying parallel to the beach. It is believed to date from the late 18th or early 19th century. It may be the Avon, built in Nova Scotia in 1843, reported to have “stranded and drifted alongshore to the east of Rye harbour and received considerable damage” in August 1852, while returning from Le Havre with a cargo of timber. Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said the two ships were very different but equally fascinating. “Many of the ships that Historic England protects are accessible only to ers but when the sands shift and the tide is right, visitors to these beaches in Kent and Sussex can catch a glimpse of these incredible wrecks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d859e8270629aa1af87e2aba43b1766d6d4a92f6/0_192_4110_2465/master/4110.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8270734027a4d8406787c381d7b89836","title":"jamie murray victoria azarenka miss out mixed doubles final","story":"• Austrian Alexander Peya and Nicole Melichar of US take title• Murray and Azarenka may reunite to play in the US OpenIt was not quite the ending Jamie Murray and Victoria Azarenka wanted but they enjoyed their run to the final of the mixed doubles so much they might just do it again.The unseeded pair, who decided only at the last minute to play together here, were beaten 7-6 (1), 6-3 by Alexander Peya of Austria and Nicole Melichar of the United States, the No 11 seeds, who each won their first grand slam titles of any kind.Murray and Azarenka, the former singles world No 1, entertained the crowds here throughout their five matches, coming from a set down twice and once recovering from 5-1 down in the final set to stay alive. But after dropping the first set on the tie-break, Murray was then broken at the start of the second set and they could not get back on terms. The 38‑year‑old Peya served out to love to claim the title, a sweet moment for the 24‑year‑old Melichar, who had lost in the final of the women’s doubles the previous day.“It’s disappointing to lose but it’s been awesome,” said Murray, who was hoping to win the title for the third time, having triumphed with two other former world No 1s, in 2007 with Jelena Jankovic, of Serbia, and last year with Martina Hingis, the Swiss.“We earned our place in the final, bloody hell. We played so much tennis. It was a lot of fun to play with Vika and after losing in the men’s it was nice to have a good run in the mixed. I had a great time.“We lost today, which is disappointing when you have worked so hard to get to the final, but over the course of the two weeks we put a lot of good tennis out there, fought hard through difficult moments. Overall we’ve got to be pleased with how it went. It’s not easy to get to grand slam finals.”After their respective Tour commitments this summer Murray and Azarenka will both be back in grand slam action at the US Open, which starts at the end of August. Murray won the title last year with Hingis and, depending on how things work out, he and Azarenka could be back in action together in New York.Peya, who reached the final here in 2015, and Melichar, who appeared in her first grand slam final with Kveta Peschke on Saturday, were that bit sharper throughout, not allowing a single break point in the opening set and picking off the Murray‑Azarenka returns at the net. After ripping through the tie-break 7-1, they saved three break points on the Peya serve in the opening game of the second before breaking Murray after Azarenka let a return pass her down the middle and was then pinned by a Melichar pass.From then on it was hard work and, though Murray and Azarenka saved a match point on the Azarenka serve at 2-5, Peya showed no nerves as he served out to love, clinching the title when Azarenka’s forehand return slid wide.“Alex did a lot of good things today at the net, cutting off the space well,” Murray said. “Obviously I lost my serve in the second set and didn’t return very well and help Vika enough. I didn’t really feel I served that well, either.”For Azarenka, a run in the mixed doubles was a bonus after an early departure in the singles. The Belarusian, whose return from having her first child at the end of December 2016 has been slower than it might because of a custody battle, is intent on returning to the top of the women’s game. She will go into the US summer hard-court events ranked just outside the top 100 but the extra match practice she had here should help her going forward.“I think it was important for me to play and be in those situations where the momentum changes a lot of times, try to figure out the way,” she said. “It was definitely a positive.Had Jack Draper managed to recover from his four-hour, 24-minute semi-final to claim the Wimbledon boys’ title on Sunday, it would have gone down as one of the most amazing victories in the event’s history. And he came close, a valiant effort in searing heat not quite enough to deny the top seed, Tseng Chun-hsin of Taipei, who took the title thanks to a 6-1, 6-7 (2), 6-4 victory.Outplayed in the first set and looking jaded after his week’s exertions, Draper summoned up one major effort and took the match to a decider on a mixture of talent and adrenalin. In the third set, he twice recovered from a break down to level but finally, his resilience was ended when Tseng broke for 5-4 and served out.It was a disappointing end to the week for the young Briton but the way he competed suggests the left-hander has a big future. Beaten in round one last year, he has improved enormously and has a real swagger about him, an attitude that should serve him well as he looks to progress.Simon Cambers at Wimbledon"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8d3b8166ddfefa6cfc7d229acf4b9cb1d5add64/0_56_4263_2560/master/4263.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2195d356638b54b983c3654b7bb9516b","title":"john cynn world series of poker texas hold em winner","story":"John Cynn won the World Series of Poker marquee no-limit Texas Hold ‘em main event Sunday in Las Vegas, surrounded by a cheering crowd that included his father. He eliminated Tony Miles on the 442nd hand of the final table, after playing 199 hands against each other with bricks of $100 bills and a gold bracelet at the table.Cynn, 33, became $8.8m richer after playing against Miles for more than 10 hours. He was visibly shocked, grabbed his head and momentarily crouched as the crowd roared after his win. Miles took home $5m. He hugged his supporters after his defeat and shed some tears off stage. “Right now, I do feel pretty overwhelmed,” said Cynn. “The money is very significant, but I do like to think that I don’t need the money to be happy, but at the same time, practically, it’s going to make things a lot easier, things I want to do in life.”Cynn’s final king of clubs and jack of clubs was stronger than Miles’s, who went all in with queen of clubs and eight of hearts. The community cards were king of hearts, king of diamonds, five of hearts, eight of diamonds and four of spades. Each of the nine players who made it to the final table was guaranteed at least $1m. They represented the US, Australia, France and Ukraine.The famed tournament this year drew 7,874 players who either risked $10,000 or earned a seat through satellite competitions with lower buy-ins. The series as a whole has seen more than 120,200 entrants so far, and organizers believe the weeks-long event in its 49th year could go down as the largest ever.Cynn, a native of Evanston, Illinois, now residing in Indianapolis, had previously cashed at various series tournaments and barely missed the main event’s final table two years ago, when he finished in 11th place and won $650,000. This year, he started play on the last night of the final table as the player with the second-most chips with 128.7m. Earlier in the night, Miles bluffed Cynn off the better hand when he shoved 95.3m chips, going all-in. Cynn took about three minutes before folding. The broadcast showed Cynn had two pair including a pair of threes on the board. Miles essentially had nothing, yet he reached 154.9m chips after taking the pot. About 90 hands later, Miles again went all in. He pushed 74m chips, and Cynn eventually called. When they rolled over their cards, Miles ended with triple sixes, while Cynn had two pair, including a pair of sixes on the board. Miles increased his stack to 182m at that point.

Great Britain, who were buoyed by a victory in the women’s 4x100m relay on Sunday, finished third.The sobering prospect for the other seven countries in this new team-based competition is that this was far from being the strongest USA squad. Yet they had wrapped up the competition halfway through Sunday evening, winning 11 golds, 10 silvers and six bronze medals to score 219 points from the 34 events. Poland were second on 162, with Britain third on 155, two points ahead of Jamaica in fourth.Yet there were several performances to cheer the home crowd. The bravest surely came from Morgan Lake, who cleared 1.93m to come second in the women’s high jump behind the American Vashti Cunningham, despite suffering from food poisoning. Adelle Tracey also got a second place in the women’s 800m while Beth Dobbin was third with 22.95sec in the women’s 200m.“The atmosphere was great,” Dobbin said. “The race was a blur but I am happy to finish third. The crowd were amazing, almost overwhelming. I didn’t step foot inside the stadium before the race but when I did, it was just a normal track and I was not as nervous as I thought I was going to be.”Britain’s sole win on Sunday was in the 4x100m, as their team of Asha Philip, Imani-Lara Lansiquot, Bianca Williams and Shannon Hylton took advantage of an injury on the US team to win in 42.52sec.As on Saturday’s first day, the quality of the fields in the eight-country competition was mixed. For instance no competitors in the men’s 100m, track and field’s blue ribband event, qualified in last year’s World Championships.However the crowd, numbering around 20-25,000, were able to enjoy several very impressive performances. Among the highlights were the South African Luvo Manyonga producing an excellent series of long jumps to win in 8.51m, while the American Sam\u0026nbspKendricks won the men’s pole vault with a clearance of 5.83m.“I have good memories of this stadium and again the crowd was great,” said Manyonga. “The new set-up is quite exciting. The distance came out and I am happy. It feels great to compete in a team.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77f94da3be2173596b5cb4ca121298bfccbc6c31/16_281_3879_2327/master/3879.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41befcc208219fd499e01787211ad20f","title":"tiger woods the open carnoustie brandon stone","story":"• Woods: ‘Coming here to Carnoustie is special’• Brandon Stone shoots round of 60 to win Scottish OpenThere was a time in the not-so distant past when Tiger Woods doubted he would feature in the Open Championship again. This week at Carnoustie marks Woods’s first appearance in the third major of the year since 2015. It was no wonder, then, that a chipper Woods stepped from the 18th green after eight Sunday practice holes.“It has been a while and I’ve missed it,” Woods said of pursuing the Claret Jug. “This is the oldest tournament we have in our sport. I have my name on the trophy a few times so that’s pretty cool. To come out here and play in the Open Championship is always good.“And then coming here to Carnoustie, it is special. This is my fourth time playing it as a tournament. From my first time coming here as an amateur to being back now, it’s just amazing how this course doesn’t change. It is right in front of you, it is hard it’s probably the most difficult one we play in the whole rotation.”This, the 147th Open, will provide a rare test. A freakishly dry Scottish summer has left the Carnoustie fairways scorched. If the visuals are stunning, devil lies in the golfing detail. Woods, for example, hit a seven-iron from the tee of the 415-yard 4th on Sunday afternoon. Padraig Harrington found water at the 18th on Saturday from an estimated distance of 457 yards.“Right now the fairways are faster than the greens,” Woods said. “I am sure they will probably speed the greens up a touch but I’m sure this will be one of those weeks where the fairways are a little quicker than the greens. It is mainly about trajectory. You can get the same numbers with different trajectories. That’s what is going to be important, how hot you want the ball coming into the fairways. You can really make the ball roll 60, 70, 80 yards is it really worth it or not? Some of the holes can you carry bunkers? It is a risk reward golf course and the way it is set up right now, it is going to play very narrow because it is so fast.”This marks Woods’s 20th Open. With that in mind, he denied recent absence as caused by injury means a requirement to “re-learn” links golf. He can also draw on famous victories, having prevailed 18 and 12 years ago when it was burnt underfoot.“I have played in so many Opens but also so many links courses in my career. We don’t get a chance to see it quite this firm very often, it was like this in 2000 and like this at Hoylake but we don’t really see the fairways this quick. It’s different this week and will be a lot of fun.“I have only played eight holes so I have a lot of work to do over the next few days. Different winds are forecast for the next few days so it will be nice to see those different conditions.“It’s a feel thing. People don’t realise, especially watching on TV, the difference between landing a ball on the downslope versus into an upslope and how many yards that can mean to a shot. It is just different. We have had all different playing conditions here. We have had it burnt out and dry, we have had it thick and lush. It is what it is. That’s the neat thing about coming to links courses, we play it as it is. It’s not tricked up and it’s right in front of us.”Woods, who had visited Wimbledon for the first time on Saturday, displayed no physical discomfort at all during a brief range session and subsequent eight hole stretch. His last back surgery, his fourth, has apparently paid off. “My back has been good,” he said. “That’s one of the good things about all the strength training I have been doing, I have gotten to where it feels good every day.”Reports emerged last week that a match between Woods and his long-time adversary – before peace broke out – Phil Mickelson is in the late planning stages. Las Vegas has been touted as a location, as has the prospect of a $10m prize purse.As Woods was beginning the formal element of his Open preparations, Brandon Stone earned a Carnoustie spot in stunning style. The South African produced a closing round of 60 at the Scottish Open to claim his third European Tour title."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e198b9d87c6698d093413cac3ecbd808d60c6b97/0_66_4928_2959/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83c6f05ed7f8ddd2f15b5784d98a5723","title":"giro rosa won by australian team mitchelton scott","story":"Australian team Mitchelton-Scott are celebrating victory in the most prestigious race on the women’s road cycling tour calendar, the Giro Rosa, in Italy.The team won six of the 10 stages with three different riders and their Dutch star Annemiek van Vleuten claimed the overall title after dominating the final stage on Sunday.Van Vleuten began the final stage with a three minute, 35 second lead over South African Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio (Cervelo-Bigla), who was the first to attack on the final climb with van Vleuten close behind.The Dutchwoman pulled clear to win the stage by more than 27 seconds and said the title was a dream come true for the whole team.The team switched its focus to general classification this year, targeting a first Giro Rosa title in the 29th staging of the race.“We prepared so well for this race and to win six stages, the overall and three jerseys and do it in this way racing with confidence and control – it’s a super story for the team,” van Vleuten said.“I felt that it was good to attack on the climb and carry some speed into the descent.

And what a personage do Ross be these days! A banker as well as a politician, who meets the prime minister for dinner. And, finally, a man secure enough in his position in the world that he’s able to take his goodly wife to London with him. Hurrah! Ale and stargazy pie all round.This was a solid and entertaining outing, with some long-overdue humorous touches following the grief and violence of recent times. Of course, the ill-fated Pascoe’s Bank, the name of which had been trailed increasingly unsubtly as a harbinger of doom in the previous five episodes, had to have its moment in the plot, complete with a near-full-scale re-enactment of It’s a Wonderful Life. Only Clarence the angel was missing.The scene outside the bank as Demelza and crew flounced around with their “deposits” was superb, showcasing the finest, faux-hammy work from Prudie (Beatie Edney, to whom we raise the pewter tankard below), Sam (Tom York) and Zacky (Tristan Sturrock). “Deposit! As I’ve done every month some 20 years!” “Truly, I declare, I trust Pascoe’s with my life.” You could feel the actors’ enjoyment beaming out of the screen and it was a joy to behold. Sometimes I wish there could be a spin-off series (Nampara Nights?) where it’s just comedy and no dead babies and no Evil George. This was a much-needed moment of levity – and before even the glorious, picturesque fireworks at the you-must-all-have-a-sixpence-to-make-up-for-lack-of-salary house party. I did wonder if Ross would really be so forgiving when Demelza took it upon herself to write off £3,800 of his money (which, in the 19th century, was the equivalent of a gazillion pounds) without even asking him. Morally, she did the right thing, but in reality she unwittingly handed everything – lock, stock and barrel of ale – over to Evil George. This is the single most irritating thing about Ross’s inconsistent character. One minute he is utterly broken by the slightest twist of fate, the next he is laughing off a gigantic, life-ruining, mine-destroying debt because he feels he can fix anything with a flash of his mop-haired charisma.In a more plausible development, Sindy Doll returned to Dr Enys, as is only right. And Morwenna spurned Drake definitively due to being pregnant by the late pig’s-tail-buttocked vicar, as is only wrong. Far less plausibly, Elizabeth forged on with a plan she and Ross seem to have devised almost telepathically: to get pregnant (by Evil George) so that she can “prove” her pregnancies last only eight months, thereby “proving” that Valentine is not Ross’s baby, despite the child looking to anyone in the possession of eyes exactly like a mini-me Ross. I hope that by the time this series is over we at least get to see what a child fathered by Evil George actually looks like. I just hope for Elizabeth’s sake that it doesn’t come out chin first.The most troubling detail of all, however, was left to last. Demelza be going to London. Which leaves Prudie in charge of Cornwall. Oh, Judas.We haven’t seen quite as much of Prudie this season, but I’m hoping that next week, while Demelza and Ross are in London, she can do something that truly ain’t right nor proper. As Prudie, Edney always shines, even with very little to do, and in this episode she relished every cameo moment. Prudie’s fortes include skulking, appearing out of nowhere and doing extremely unconvincing lying – and this week she had an opportunity to do all three, particularly in the bank scene. No one in the history of humanity has been less likely to persuade anyone to invest in a bank. And she camped it up like nobody’s business. Edney (whom we must worship excessively) has said that she plays Prudie “like a cross between a rat and a toddler” and she excelled in her aim here. Long may she toddle, skulk and potter about pointlessly. We raise the pewter tankard to Prudie’s greatness, while holding on to it with a firm grip given half a chance, she would more than likely pilfer it.Drake picked up the chesty baton with a refreshing dip in the bay to try to calm his fevered mind and ease the pain of his singed smithy. I mean, he’s a nice boy and all and thank ’e kindly. But no. It’s just not the same as Ross. Paging Aidan Turner’s agent now. Finally, there is a point to Frilly Shirt Man as he gets his claws into Demelza. Morwenna is off to the asylum. And there’s a duel! We’re going to need considerably more barrels of beer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3d1ae958dd51135115bb2e0f564f903dd0144ff/737_0_4118_2470/master/4118.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab59e643e3fd34d748b72dee8d5973ef","title":"unforgotten series three review tvs most likable detective duo is back","story":"DCI Stuart and DS Khan return for what promises to be another tight, gripping, but also moving investigationA digger is doing its thing: digging.

I\u0026nbspwonder if this series will address the end of the last one, when they played judges as well as cops, deciding that the culprits had suffered enough and let them off,\u0026nbspremember?Anyway, back to this one. In Hampshire, GP Tim is consoling a\u0026nbspbereaved patient. We’ll see another, angrier side to Dr\u0026nbspTim later\u0026nbsp… there has been a\u0026nbspcomplaint against him. Another often angry man is James in London\u0026nbsp– cuddly on camera (he’s a TV presenter with a\u0026nbspgameshow), cross and controlling off it. James has a\u0026nbspwayward, drug-addicted\u0026nbspson. To Norfolk, where Pete isn’t selling enough ISAs to buy shoes for the kids and his younger boss speaks nonsense salesperson-speak. And, finally, to Bristol, where artist Chris lives in a\u0026nbspvan with his dog. But things look as if they may be getting better for him. Poverty, insecurity, generational differences, anger, drugs\u0026nbsp… there’s plenty more of modern Britain among the cast of series three – Unforgotten is good at\u0026nbspthat.These four men know each other, of course. One phone call gives that away. That’s what Chris Lang’s Unforgotten does (and does so well): takes separate strands and expertly, elegantly splices them into something thicker and more meaningful something that will move the viewer back in time as well as down into that grisly hole in the central reservation on the M1.Not so far back in time, though. The skeleton isn’t archaeological, inevitably. Cassie’s hunch was right about that (as Cassie’s hunches tend to be). She may not be sleeping well, but she’s still great at what she does, as is Nicola Walker playing her. Further tests, plus investigation from the team, keep on narrowing it down\u0026nbsp– female, young, broken wrist, which was fixed with a\u0026nbsptitanium plate in Cyprus\u0026nbsp…Until eventually they have a\u0026nbsplist of missing girls, one of whom the skeleton almost certainly is. And a\u0026nbsplist of phone numbers of families to call, to ask if their girl broke her wrist in Cyprus, possibly on a\u0026nbspfamily holiday. First, though, a\u0026nbspwarning to the team from Cassie. “The best most of these families will have hoped for, for many years, will simply have been finding a\u0026nbspbody to bury,” she says. “For all but one of them\u0026nbsp– that’s if we’re lucky\u0026nbsp– we’re going to offer them that little glimmer of hope, only to snatch it away seconds later. So we tread gently please, we tread very\u0026nbspgently.”And that is another thing Unforgotten is so good at, not just police procedure, clever plot and expert splicing and tying things together. It doesn’t let you forget that at the core of a\u0026nbspmurder investigation is the saddest human tragedy. Now one with a\u0026nbspname\u0026nbsp– Hayley Reid – who disappeared, aged\u0026nbsp16, on her way to a\u0026nbspparty.It’s hard not to think of real-life cases. It’s impossible not to be moved by Hayley’s sister, now in her 30s, wailing and sobbing on a\u0026nbspcoastal bench at the end of the episode. Just the one little moan, the usual one: too much gratuitous violin. I\u0026nbspdon’t need overbearing, soaring strings to tell me this is a\u0026nbspsad\u0026nbspmoment.Otherwise, Unforgotten is\u0026nbsp– once again\u0026nbsp– superb. Clever, without being clever-clever big-on character without trying to be all bleak and Scandi. It is beautifully crafted and performed tight, gripping, but also moving and so very human.

Sitting through the largely tiresome pilot of Cohen’s latest program Who Is America? inspires longing for a simpler past, when Cohen’s profile was still low enough that he didn’t have to mask his face with nightmare-inducing prosthetics just to go incognito. He plays four characters in the first episode of this new series – an obese quack doctor, an NPR-listening uberliberal, a limey ex-con, and a gruff Israeli commando – all of whom evoke fonder memories of sweet Borat, the good-natured traveler in thrall of a “very nice” world full of “great success!” As hardliners on the left and right, gun nuts and bleeding-heart activists, confrontation is baked into the very premise of this new quartet.But the real nostalgia is for Borat’s era, the comparatively low-stakes idyll of the Bush administration’s tail end. Cohen is now returning to a form he popularized during a time marked by a different set of notions about how comedy best functions, and a different viewership to receive it. For Borat, wannabe rudeboy Ali G, and flamboyant talk show host Brüno, George W Bush was the perfect bad President, an ideal target. He was just incompetent enough to provide endless fodder for mockery, and yet not so calamitously harmful that there would be no fun in making fun. And the people proud to identify themselves as living in Bush’s America revealed the psychosis under heartland values, as gleefully racist as they were hospitable. Cohen was looked on as a daring subversive for turning politeness against his unwitting victims, feeding them the rope by which they could then happily hang themselves. (His “throw the Jew down the well” segment remains surreal, hysterically funny, and deeply disturbing.)Much has transpired since then, and Cohen knows it. He’s unabashedly political in his aspirations for this program, attempting to define an American identity by interviewing its wild and woolly citizens. The implication here, as with all comedy that dares to skew political in the year 2018, is that this is urgent work for an urgent moment. Early threats of legal action from such well-known reprobates as Joe Arpaio and Roy Moore promised cathartic comeuppance after watching these slimy characters take every page of the circumlocution playbook on news programs trying their best to remain decorous, the public would get the chance to watch them go up against someone who didn’t have professional scruples getting in the way of his hate.And when he does, by god, it works. Cohen saves the clear standout segment of the first episode for last, in which, with minimal difficulty, he convinces a handful of congressmen to support a bill arming four-year-olds with firearms. It will go down as one of the more effective works of Trump-era satire, as damning and chilling and disarmingly strange as the latest tweet from the commander-in-chief. The sight of a geriatric man brandishing a semiautomatic rifle outfitted with cute bunny-rabbit ears will not leave the memory of those who gaze upon it any time soon.To Cohen’s detriment, that only throws the shortcomings of the other segments into sharper relief. In the first three parts, he ribs Bernie Sanders as a yokel with a fundamental misunderstanding of what the “one percent” is, discusses his daughter’s free-bleeding onto an American flag over dinner with small-town staunch conservatives, and pitches his bodily-secretion artworks to a Laguna Beach dealer. While the latter of the three has the distinction of being astonishingly weird (the woman that gladly clips a lock of her pubic hair is, hands down, the most game person Cohen has ever interviewed), they’re all hamstrung by a sense of inconsequentiality.With Cohen going out of his way to position Who Is America? in a fractious and chaotic nation beset by families torn asunder, militarized forces suppressing protests, and lives lost, he sets the bar extremely high for himself. When he manages to clear it, the results are dazzling (the final segment has already become viral gold on Twitter), but anything less feels like a waste of time. The woods are burning, and he gives us poop jokes? The line on Cohen was initially that he may be too dangerous for the US, a country that loves nothing more than getting worked up over incendiary comedy gunning for that exact reaction. Odd, fascistic twists of fate have reversed the situation, however. After a sojourn in the unforgiving wilds of feature acting, Cohen returns to the American mainstream to find that it has grown too dangerous for him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1f9755d0bc32310e0e82d158958801e14714cf8/0_0_3059_1836/master/3059.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c82ca20aaed9f1fe91cf87497c3bf300","title":"ethiopia eritrea abiy ahmed charismatic young peacemaker","story":"The flags of the two nations flew bright and sharp.

Whoever forgets that does not understand our situation.”Many Ethiopians expressed their exhilaration on social media. “The events of these past … days between Ethiopia and Eritrea are like the fall of the Berlin Wall. Only amplified 1,000 times,” Samson Haileyesus wrote on Facebook. The reaction in Eritrea has been equally ecstatic.Analysts say such hyperbole may be justified. The bid for peace with Eritrea is just the latest in a series of efforts that may bring revolutionary reform to Africa’s second most populous nation, transform a region and send shockwaves from the Mediterranean to the Cape of Good Hope.Since coming to power in April, Abiy has electrified Ethiopia with his informal style, charisma and energy, earning comparisons with Nelson Mandela, Justin Trudeau, Barack Obama and Mikhail Gorbachev. He has reshuffled his cabinet, fired a series of controversial and hitherto untouchable civil servants, including the head of Ethiopia’s prison service, lifted bans on websites and other media, freed thousands of political prisoners, ordered the partial privatisation of massive state-owned companies, ended a state of emergency imposed to quell widespread unrest and removed three opposition groups from a list of “terrorist” organisations.Nic Cheeseman, an expert in African politics at Birmingham University, said Abiy’s extraordinary campaign was a test of the argument that only repressive government can guarantee the levels of development so desperately needed across Africa.Despite an International Monetary Fund forecast predicting that Ethiopia, which has relied on a centralised economic model and political repression for decades, would be the fastest-growing economy in sub-Saharan Africa in 2018, even the officially sanctioned press has admitted the country’s serious difficulties.There is a shortage of foreign currency, growing inequality, a lack of jobs for a huge number of graduates, environmental damage, ethnic tensions and deep hunger for change.“Ethiopia was on the edge of the abyss. They have realised they cannot continue in the same old way. Only an advanced democratic system would prevent the country coming to pieces and a disaster that Africa has never seen before,” said Andargachew Tsege, a British citizen unexpectedly pardoned in May after four years on death row on terrorism charges. Abiy invited Tsege, who was abducted by Ethiopian security services four years ago, to a meeting two days after his release. They spoke for 90 minutes.No one claims that Isaias, the “hard and rigid” ruler of Eritrea since 1991, has much in the way of new ideas. A nation of about 5.1 million people, Eritrea is the only African country where elections are not held. As many as 5,000 Eritreans flee their country every month, notably to avoid indefinite military conscription. Many head to Europe. The economy has flatlined for decades. The UN has accused the regime of crimes against humanity.Once a province of Ethiopia that comprised its entire coastline on the Red Sea, Eritrea voted to leave in 1993 after a decades-long, bloody struggle.The thaw began last month when Abiy said he would abide by a UN-backed ruling and hand back to Eritrea disputed territory. Analysts say conflicts across the region fuelled by the rift are now likely to die down.For the moment Abiy’s reforms have popular support, and the crucial backing of much of the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front, the rebel coalition that came to power in 1991.But there is resistance. Last month, a grenade was thrown at a rally organised to showcase support for the reforms in Addis Ababa’s vast Meskel Square. Two died. “Love always wins ... To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded,” Abiy said after the attack.Much depends on the determination of the Ethiopian leader. Seen as a relative outsider before being picked for the top job by the EPRDF council, Abiy is the first leader from Ethiopia’s largest ethnic community, the Oromo, who have complained for decades of economic, cultural and political marginalisation. The EPRDF is split by battles between four ethnically based parties as well as fierce competition between institutions and iniduals.As Abiy’s reforms gather momentum, the risks rise too. “Democracy can be achieved through benevolent leadership, but it can only be consolidated through democratic institutions. What we are seeing now is more of a personality-cult kind of movement,” said Mekonnen Mengesha, a lecturer at Wolkite University.Like other African countries– such as Kenya and Zimbabwe just over a decade ago – Ethiopia has seen previous efforts to reform its closed, autocratic system that have not ended happily.“It’s really exciting and great news, but Abiy has not done anything that really threatens the regime,” said Cheeseman. “And until a government is actually faced with losing power you don’t know what will happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/880570362e166952577eccb3d13b679dc0dec91a/0_145_3440_2064/master/3440.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c42cac68a406c491bb314d4016f9bcb9","title":"pussy riot claim responsibility world cup final pitch invasion","story":"Protest performance group say four members ran on to pitch in protest during second halfThe Russian protest performance group Pussy Riot have claimed responsibility for a pitch invasion early in the second half of the World Cup final.“Right now, there are four members of Pussy Riot on the pitch,” the group wrote on its Facebook page.

Prostrate among island sea pinks above seals and wheeling seabirds, or crouched among Arctic rocks to watch polar bears parading on the frozen fiord below, the view from the top balcony can be sublime.With or without wildlife, the view is what enchants summer tourists on the Wild Atlantic Way. On TripAdvisor, some hundreds of visitors to Donegal’s Slieve League have been ecstatic. “Dramatic scenery, history, elemental nature, and the freshest air in all the world. Powerful!” sets the tone.We oldies, of course, remember Slieve League before the fenced viewing platform, the shuttle bus up from the visitor centre, the car parks and craft shop, the ice cream van and “yummy” lobster rolls at the top. Clutching each other, well back from the edge, 600m above the sea, we muttered “Oh my God!” into the wind long before that cry went acronymic and digital.Together with the seashore between the tides, the cliffs of Ireland are the island’s last wild – or “least modified” – land. Hard and metamorphic at its storm-lashed western rim, soft and crumbly in glacial boulder clay, they make up a fifth of the coastline.All of them qualify for periodic monitoring as “EU Annex 1 habitat Vegetated sea cliffs of the Atlantic and Baltic coasts” under Europe’s nature directives. Peering up through binoculars from boats or tidal shores, lowered (exceptionally) on ropes, or peering at good helicopter and telephoto images, a team of botanists has done its best to identify and map what’s growing at almost 200 locations, 32 of them surveyed in person (see Irish Wildlife Manual No 53 at npws.ie)Most are at least partly within NPWS conservation sites, offering some clout against rubbish tips and car dumps (a special temptation on islands) or misplaced rock armour at the base. A more natural “threat” is invasion by alien plants, such as gunnera, cotoneaster, escaped garden hebe and silvery ragwort, all documented in the NPWS survey. Native vegetation begins with the black skirt of lichen at the splash zone of Atlantic cliffs and a progression of salt-resistant plants to the windy fringe above.At every crevice and ledge, flowering cushions of sea pink are the most frequent plants, but surveys with ropes found more than twice as many species as could be spotted in remote photographs, filling in the plantains, wild thyme, mosses and lichens.The tallest cliff in the survey was at Achill’s Slievemore (660m to 670m), and the longest stretch centred at Glinsk on the north Mayo coast. This offers a remarkable 68km of swoops and crags, historical haunt of golden and sea eagles.The stiff-winged fulmar was noted as the commonest breeding seabird. Since it first arrived in Mayo in 1911, the fulmar’s coast-wide spread and assiduous trawler-stalking have helped keep its population relatively secure, though the falling numbers of young fulmars echo a wider seabird decline.Among the thousands of birds lining the ledges of island and mainland cliffs, the most exposed positions are taken by the guillemot. Dispensing with a nest, it relies on the conical (pyriform) shape to its egg to stop it rolling off. A coating of sticky guano also helps, but accidents happen and starfish swarm to an eggy, seabed banquet at the foot of some cliffs in Kerry.The clamour of the bird colonies peaks in early summer and begins to quieten down this month as partly-grown chicks flutter down to the sea, paddle feet splayed, and shepherded by a parent. This happens at dusk in failing light to avoid the beaks of great black-backed gulls and skuas.Puffins are mostly gone in a rapid desertion in August. The single chick has been fed by both parents, flying back to the burrow among clifftop sea pinks with their notched bills lined – ideally – with sandeels.Human impacts (global warming sending the sandeels north, the global ocean litter of plastic pellets) have led to damaging changes in puffin diet, to impossibly spiny fish species or gulletfuls of plastic lentils. But new research suggests another, biological, factor.An international study, led by Oxford University and involving UCC scientists, tracked the journeys of 270 puffins from a wide range of breeding grounds around the Atlantic to feed in winter on shoals of oil-rich capelin off North America. Irish birds, taking a circuitous route, made the longest journeys – up to 4,700km there and back. They arrive to breed at our cliffs so exhausted that they lay only one egg and struggle to feed the chick. So suggests the study published in Current Biology and reported fully at https:iti.ms2J6yN9z. All the more reason, says study co-author Mark Jessopp of UCC, to care for the puffins we’ve got.

Video: Kevin Burke, Sutton\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPassenger Miomir Todorovic uploaded a photograph from the inside of the plane, saying ‘I can barely hear my right ear. Important that we survived’.A number of passengers on board the Ryanair flight from Dublin to Croatia that had to make an emergency landing in Germany have described their experiences.Dozens of passengers were taken to hospital complaining of headache and earache and suffering from nausea after the plane depressurised rapidly.Sarah McGarry, from Ratoath in Co Meath, spoke to The  from the basement at Frankfurt Hahn airport where she had been staying overnight.She explained the moment when the cabin started losing pressure:“We get on the plane, we’re flying and next of all the oxygen mask comes down, we’re left in darkness for 15 minutes, there’s no reassurance just people shouting ‘emergency, emergency’.“There was a newborn baby and children on the flight, people are screaming and we don’t know what’s going on for 15 minutes . . . Then finally we’re told that we’re going to Germany.”Another passenger, who did not want to be named, said “it was really scary, there were three to four minutes (that felt like an hour) when the plane was falling fast and I thought we were done for”.The passenger, who was travelling with three young children, said people were bleeding from the eardrums when they landed.Ms McGarry, who was travelling to Zadar for a holiday with her boyfriend, said her eardrum burst during the descent. However, she did not go to the hospital in an ambulance because she was not told if she would be back in time to catch the rescheduled flight, which was due to take off at 9.30am on Saturday.“My eardrum burst when the plane dropped and I was told I’d have to travel 70km to be seen at the hospital because that there were no doctors there available. I wasn’t reassured if I went that I’d be able to get back on the flight.“I chose not to go because if I travelled to the hospital I wasn’t reassured that I’d get back on the same flight and with the same passengers.”Ms McGarry says she has been “sitting in Germany on a cold hard floor for 11 hours now, all I’ve got to eat is a croissant and a coffee to the value of the €10 voucher we were given.“I was told I’d have to purchase anything else with my own money.”Ms McGarry’s boyfriend, Keiran Blunt, said their treatment by Ryanair has been “disgraceful”.“It’s disgraceful, I know these things happen but what really got me was the lack of reassurance from the company in general.“There was no reassurance from the captain, from the staff team at Ryanair, we were just left in limbo since yesterday.“The children here have been left without water, they’ve had no lunch provided to them.“There was a newborn baby on board, a few months old, and I had to steal water from a fridge here in Frankfurt just to provide the family with some water.“There’s young lads between 9 and 12 who’ve been given nothing with any nutritional value. We were let sleep here on a cold concrete floor.“I’m not one to complain, I take things in my stride it was quite disgraceful. It was atrocious. There was no apology and I’m a bit disappointed.”Conor Brennan (21), one of the passengers who was taken to hospital after suffering a severe build up of fluid behind his ears.He described the chaos on board:“Oxygen masks dropped and then about 20 seconds later the pilot made an announcement that he was going to make a controlled descent. Then we descended really, really fast for about 5 minutes. My ears felt like they were going to explode.“Then we levelled off and continued descending for about 10 minutes. We landed in Zadar airport, I remained on the plane for about 20 minutes despite requesting medical attention.“Eventually we disembarked and waited on the runway for another 20 minutes. We were then bussed over to a terminal, where we waited another 20 minutes before we received a medical brief, where they had a look at us.“There was another half an hour then before I received any kind of actual attention from a doctor, who gave me painkillers. Then an hour after that I was bussed to the hospital.“There was very little sign if at all of any Ryanair staff there. Airport staff and the German red cross were the only people I could see there who were helping.“The airport staff and Red Cross did their best to handle the situation, as Ryanair were nowhere to be seen, the first communication from Ryanair was this morning with food vouchers Ryanair .“They really displayed a shocking lack of empathy for their customers, almost bordering on inhumane.”In response to a query from The  on Saturday morning, Ryanair released a statement saying: “This flight from Dublin to Zadar (13 July) erted to Frankfurt Hahn due to an inflight depressurisation. In line with standard procedure, the crew deployed oxygen masks and initiated a controlled descent. The aircraft landed normally and customers disembarked, where a small number received medical attention as a precaution.“Customers were provided with refreshment vouchers and hotel accommodation was authorised, however there was a shortage of available accommodation. Customers will board a replacement aircraft which will depart to Zadar this morning and Ryanair sincerely apologised for any inconvenience.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3565561.1531588834!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pilots and passengers have just minutes before decompression knocks them out","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tInside Ryanair flight FR7213 after the oxygen masks dropped. Photograph: Conor BrennanHumans cannot survive long at\u0026nbspthe heights reached during flights, because the air is so thin, and so aircraft cabins are artificially maintained at a pressure similar to that encountered at 8,000 feet or less.This is achieved by taking air from one of the engines after it has been compressed by a series of fan blades prior to being ignited to provide forward thrust. This is known as bleed air.Without artificially pressurised bleed air, passengers and crew suffer a condition known as hypoxia, which can cause them to lose what is known as “useful consciousness” within a few minutes. Indeed pilots rapidly lose the ability to make decisions and safely operate the aircraft if they fail to don oxygen masks within 30 seconds of an aircraft losing artificial pressure, or depressurisation.If the pressure in the cabin falls below that normally encountered at 14,000 feet, oxygen masks are automatically deployed in the passenger cabin and pilots receive a warning in the cockpit instructing them to don oxygen masks.Cabin crew are trained to recognise the early symptoms of hypoxia in passengers. This can include uncontrolled giggling and is sometimes noticed even before masks drop from the cabin ceiling.Once a depressurisation warning is received passengers have just 10 minutes of oxygen available to them from the masks and the pilots must immediately bring the aircraft to a lower altitude of 10,000 feet so everybody can again breath normally and safely. This usually means putting the aircraft into a steep and rapid descent which can alarm passengers as well as subjecting them to conditions which often result in serious discomfort, including severe ear pain.One of the worst examples of cabin depressurisation occurred in 2005 when a Helios Airlines Boeing 737 crashed in Greece killing 121. It was later discovered the the aircraft’s depressurisation system was not properly switched on after take-off so the pilots and passengers probably lost consciousness shortly after the airplane reached cruising altitude. The jet flew under autopilot until it ran out of fuel and crashed. In 1999 the wealthy US golfer Payne Stewart died when his private jet flew hundreds of miles after a depressurisation incident before also running out of fuel and crashing.Like other airlines, Ryanair has in the past experienced depressurisation incidents resulting in the deployment of oxygen masks. One of these, after taking off from the Spanish airport at Reus in 2004, was blamed on pilot error and resulted from taking off in a so-called bleeds-off condition when pilots deliberately do not switch on the pressurisation system to ensure greater engine power is available for taking off on short runways. Oxygen masks were deployed when the pilots failed to switch on the pressurisation system after take-off. The aircraft landed safely afterwards.However failure to switch on the pressurisation system is usually noticed shortly after take-off and the latest incident involving the Ryanair flight to Croatia, which occurred well into the flight, may have originated in mechanical failure of the pressurisation equipment and this may include the system of valves which maintain pressure in the aircraft cabin after it is depressurised. Failure of this valve system is not unknown and can result in rapid decompression.Structural failure on an aircraft can also result in decompression. Five hundred and twenty deaths, one of the largest death tolls ever in a single air accident, resulted from rapid decompression following a major split in the rear fuselage of a Japan Airlines Boeing 747 in 1985. In 1988 an Aloha Airlines air hostess was sucked to her death when part of the cabin roof peeled away on a poorly maintained airliner above Hawaii although in that case the pilots managed to land the aircraft safely.Earlier this year a US woman died after being partially sucked out of a Southwest Airline jet after her window was fractured by debris from an exploding engine."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"digitalservices@telegraphHead of Digital Publishingdigitalservices@telegraphMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

He studied for 13 years at the Dar ul-Uloom Deoband, the most influential Muslim seminary in south Asia, speaks fluent Pashto and wears local dress.After working for the BBC\u0027s Pashto service in the 1990s and creating another popular soap called New Home, New Life, he then set up his own production house, Pact Radio, in Jalalabad in 2004.With a passion for Pashto radio and a mission to find “traditional solutions for modern problems” his soaps have in the past tackled women\u0027s rights, militancy, the rule of law and health.Health issues have also become a favourite of British soaps, with Coronation Street and The Archers recently tackling sepsis and several storylines revolving around mental health.“ You can actually bring up issues in a soap opera which you can\u0027t bring up in day to day journalism,” he said.Recent plot lines have seen characters debate polio vaccination and question hearsay that drops are harmful. Extremists have preached against the global vaccination programme and health workers have been attacked in Afghanistan and Pakistan.“ Pashtuns will just believe anything you tell them and that\u0027s the whole problem actually.“ Whatever the facts say, they don\u0027t believe facts, they believe hearsay, they believe rumour and that\u0027s what the problem with polio is.

What goes on down there affects the whole of the earth in which we live.Captain Robert Falcon Scott led a team of British explorers to become the first to reach the South Pole, on what was his second Antarctic mission.His party arrived at the South Pole on January 17 in 1912, but found they were beaten there five weeks earlier after Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen led his own expedition. Scott and his explorers died on March 29 while returning from the trek after a planned rendezvous with support teams failed.Speaking after tug boats had manoeuvred the vast steel hull down the slipway at Cammell Laird, Sir David said: “It was an extraordinarily emotional moment. I\u0027m surprised myself really.I\u0027ve never seen a ship of that size get down a slipway and there was something very noble about it and very emotional. Irresistible.And, to think that it\u0027s going to go to the other end of the globe and do such valuable work and carry so many people from this country who will be working to find out all they can about the working of our planet is a marvellous thought.”Sir David and Professor Dame Jane Francis, director of BAS, pressed the button to launch the vessel into the water in front of more than 2,000 shipyard workers, scientists, engineers and guests.In the water, tugboats pulled the ship into a “wet basin” where construction work will continue. Once complete the vessel will be comprised of one million pieces of steel, 30km of piping, 5,000 valves, and 450km of cabling.Please review our commenting policyTear gas and water cannon used amid looting on Champs Elysees after France\u0026#39s World Cup final victoryElon Musk launches baseless attack on Thai cave rescue er Queen watches over Prince Louis in official christening portrait - but can you spot Her Majesty?Unforgotten, series 3 episode 1 review: as compelling as anything we’ve seen on TV this yearSecurity breach as Greenpeace director stayed night at Trump Turnberry after filming paraglider stuntMinister tells Catholic church: relax ban on contraceptionDonald Trump talks about The Queen, Brexit and NATO in interview with Piers MorganDrain paddling pools to prevent insect bites, families warnedDunkirk: The Forgotten Heroes, review: a terrific documentary that told the sad story of the men left behindDeer which swam from Isle of Wight to mainland drowns in bungled rescue attemptEmmanuel Macron pictured in emphatic celebration as France lift World Cup in RussiaInjured British man saved by off-duty medical students after jumping from clifftop in outback Australia Nicaraguan troops launch attack in south after Church siege leaves two dead in bloody uprisingFrench fans go wild after World Cup victoryPotato plant discovered by Charles Darwin to go on display after being found in cupboardLabour to back England-led bid for 2030 World CupGermany agrees to take share of 450 migrants awaiting fate on ships off ItalyThe new Doctor Who trailer suggests Jodie Whittaker\u0026#39s reign will be  quintessentially British Novichok poisoning: Nerve agent found in perfume bottle, says victim\u0026#39s brotherMinister who resigned after bombarding two women with lewd texts apologises for his \u0026#39few moments of stupidity\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/15/TELEMMGLPICT000169490379_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqPuL-8ex6Wxr3HGFUi6PIc5PJSXUFsYSH3C2romDdHfI.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"emmanuel macron pictured emphatic celebration france lift world","story":"digitalservices@telegraphMr Macron didn\u0026#39t hold back as he watched France lift the trophydigitalservices@telegraphEmmanuel Macron celebrated France\u0027s victory over Croatia in the World Cup final with his own animated display of patriotism.The French president was seen wildly gesticulating from the VIP area in the stands next to a more subdued Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, and Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, Croatia\u0027s president.Before embracing the players after the final whistle - and opting to kiss 19-year-old goalscorer Kylian Mbappé on the head - Mr Macron was pictured pumping his fists in the air as he looked down on the packed Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.As his team collected the cup on the pitch he joined Mr Putin and Mrs Grabar-Kitarović in handing out the winners and runners-up medals.Before the game Mr Putin said he told France\u0027s leader at a bilateral meeting that it\u0027s about time for Russia and France to get over the difficulties straining their relations.Mr Macron kissed Kylian Mbappé on the head before France were presented with the cupMr Putin met on Sunday in Moscow with French President Emmanuel Macron.

breastfeeding.The US had supposedly asked for language asking governments to “protect, promote, and support breastfeeding” to be removed. The resolution ultimately passed but not before world health officials were shocked at the behaviour of the US delegation at the May UN World Health Assembley\u0026nbspin Geneva, the New York Times reported.\u0026nbspEcuadorians, facing having important military aid from the US rescinded on top of harsh sanctions on critical goods, backed down. But, the US did not threaten Russia in the same manner.\u0026nbspAn unnamed Russian delegate said the country stepped up to back and help pass the resolution because they felt\u0026nbsp “it is wrong when a big country tries to push around some very small countries, especially on an issue that is really important for the rest of the world.The delegation was also opposed to another section of the resolution which called on countries to curtail promotion of products that medical experts agreed could cause harm to children according to more than a dozen delegates to the health meeting, the majority of whom requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the US, according to the newspaper.Though US\u0026nbspefforts were unsuccessful since the bulk of the original wording survived two whole days of procedural talks, language calling for “inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children to end was removed due to US efforts.\u0026nbspThe US mission to the UN nor the State Department responded to a request for comment.\u0026nbspIt appeared,\u0026nbsphowever, the US was asking to have the language removed as a sign of support for the $70bn\u0026nbspinfant formula industry which relies on mothers not exclusively breastfeeding. Baby food lobbyists were in attendance as observers to the meeting.The US also reportedly threatened to cut its contributions to the World Health Organisation - the US contributes almost 15 per cent of the agency\u0027s budget or $845m last year - if the resolution was introduced and passed.\u0026nbspIn light of the threat on Ecuador, other poorer countries in Latin America and Africa refused to introduce the resolution out of fear of American retaliation which left Russia to push it through.\u0026nbspBreastfeeding in public controversiesA woman has sparked a heated debate among parents after she revealed that she breastfeeds both her and her friend\u0027s son.

My dad would probably like him. However, the reason I can imagine his frowning ghost at my shoulder is that it is Matt, and not me, who is painting my ceiling.I can imagine his look now, part bemused, part amused, part disappointed. Why, he would wonder, unless you are in traction or have had to undergo emergency amputation of all your limbs, would you not paint your own ceiling?Indeed, it’s something\u0026nbspthat doesn’t sit happily with me, hence the nervous hovering. I am wretchedly keen to be useful. Does Matt want a third cup of coffee? Should I move something? Maybe it’s enough to stand there, staring critically at the ceiling, rubbing my chin? Matt, on the other hand, really just wants to get on with the job at hand.My dad wouldn’t have been nonplussed at me getting someone in to do a simple job through any ideas of masculinity or anything like that it’s simply that he was a builder by trade and almost supernaturally handy.\u0026nbspA trait that, despite my best efforts over the years, has utterly failed to manifest itself in my genes.We are a nation of DIYers. Last month, the Confederation of British Industry revealed that there had been a boost in two areas of the retail economy, online shopping and DIY kit. This is in spite of – or perhaps because of – households still feeling that their incomes are being squeezed. Internet shopping tends to give access to more bargains while DIY is obviously a cheaper way of improving your home than getting tradespeople in.Aside from being innately handy, it was certainly economics that drove my father to carry out any household job himself, and in my own years of DIY that’s definitely been the driving force. In the 17 years or so we’ve lived in this house, there have been few projects I’ve not decided I can tackle myself. Several have ultimately required the intervention of a specialist. But I can’t deny the rosy glow of satisfaction I got from giving it a go.YouTube has allowed us to attempt jobs normally way out of our league (Getty )A survey a couple of years ago by Armstead, which supplies products to the building trade, revealed that while Brits love a good project in the home, we’re essentially a nation of bodgers, with one in ten of us actually injuring ourselves doing DIY, and there being on average more than 31 million unfinished jobs in British homes started by amateur improvers but never completed. What’s more, we spend on average almost £250 getting an expert in to fix what we’ve made a dog’s dinner of.A godsend to bodgers like me has been YouTube, where you’ll find helpful videos on pretty much anything you care to do, even projects that really should be way out of your league. YouTube has helped me take most of my house apart and put it together again in a way that you’d almost never notice.The only thing I won’t tackle is anything to do with the car, on the grounds that bodging a vehicle could quite easily end up in death or destruction of myself, my loved ones and innocent passers-by. This is despite my dad once nearly falling off his chair when I told him I’d paid a mechanic to service my car. “Why can’t you do your own oil change?” he’d said wonderingly, as though that was the most natural thing in the world, like breathing.Nomadic Homes – Architecture on the moveSo, if I’ve been so willing to roll up my sleeves and dig in, why is Matt up a ladder doing something as simple as painting my ceiling white, which is surely the easiest of DIY jobs imaginable, the sort of thing your nan could do?It’s a good question, and my nominal retirement from DIY has coincided with me becoming a full-time homeworker. Which, you might think, is a curious state of affairs. Working from home should, theoretically, give me more time to embark on projects, made doubly inviting by the lack of the usual spectators at evening and weekend fixtures who want to know if that thing really fits on the other thing, or if you should strictly be hitting that pipe with a hammer, or pointing out that you’ve missed a bit.But with the freelance life comes a more acute realisation that time is money. It’s all well and good when you’ve got a salaried job, spending a Saturday afternoon or a Wednesday night trying to work out how to re-hang the bathroom door after you’ve taken it off to saw a bit off the bottom, but once you start devoting time out of your freelance working day to this, it means you’re not actually earning money.Allied to that is the realisation that all those trades out there are in the same boat. We’re all in the gig economy together. I could take a day off to do a job and potentially lose a couple of hundred quid in earnings. Or I could pay someone else a couple of hundred quid to do a job. Swings and roundabouts, but ultimately am I not\u0026nbspsupporting my freelance colleagues by doing the latter?We spend an average of £250 getting someone in to fix what we have broken (Getty)But the primary reason for deciding to leave it to the experts is my long and ignominious list of failures, near-misses, and unfinished jobs, of which I will avail you of just a sample selection.There was the time the mixer tap broke on the kitchen sink. I resolved that we needed a new tap. The only thing was, I couldn’t get the tap out of its housing. Enterprisingly, I decided to remove the entire sink and had to walk across Bradford city centre with it on my shoulder to a plumber’s merchants to get a new one and plead with them to get the knackered one off.There is the ongoing situation with the bedroom, and I’m risking an almighty row by even just mentioning this. I decorated it from top to bottom last year, promising faithfully that I would tidy up all the scrappy bits of wallpaper hanging off corners and under coving and on skirting boards. I have yet to fulfil this pledge.And as an addendum to this sorry tale, there’s the issue of the DIYer being tempted to buy cheap to make the project even more cost effective. In this particular case, instead of going for more expensive and easier to hang paper where you paste the wall, I opted for the least expensive option which involved soaking in wallpaper paste paper that was already as thin as a Rizla\u0026nbsppaper, resulting in it ripping, tearing and sliding all over the place. For bonus points I used a knackered old stanley knife to cut the excess off. If you’ve ever tried to use a blunt craft knife to slice wet paper, you’ll be aware that the result looks like something chewed by a pigeon.DIY faecal transplants can spread diseases, experts warnI have umpteen stories of decoration going wrong, such as the time I decided to wood panel the walls in what was to become our baby daughter’s bedroom. I dutifully spent a day gluing the panelling all along the bottom half of the four walls, and got up the next morning to find it had all fallen off.But perhaps the most ill-advised project I ever undertook was tackling the problem of low water pressure in the bath, which involved taking apart an actual gas boiler. Don’t worry, I watched at least three YouTube videos before embarking on it, and I never actually touched any of the gas bits, just the water stuff. And it did actually work. But it’s not something I would advise, or would indeed have another go at.\u0026nbspAll of which is why Matt is up his ladders in my living room, painting. We had previously got him in to plaster the ceilings to render the horrible stipple effect completely smooth (as an aside, something I once briefly tried to do myself with a big tub of ready-mixed stuff. It all ended up on my head after resolutely refusing to stick). After watching him do it, I bit the bullet and asked him to come back and paint the ceilings. And now he’s going to come and paint the walls.I still do the odd thing, of course yesterday I put up two new light fittings, which took precisely three times longer than I thought it would and was accompanied by much sweating and cursing. But I make no apologies for retiring from the bulk of DIY. In fact, it’s hugely liberating.

In order to deceive him and his team, Labour HQ paid for personalised ads to be seen by the party leader, his aides and favoured journalists, while spending far more money on adverts with another message for ordinary voters, according to claims made in a new book by former staffer Tom Baldwin that were reportedly confirmed by party sources.“In 2017, Labour Party officials became so good at targeting Facebook ads, they were able to deceive Jeremy Corbyn about the kind of campaign they were running,” wrote Mr Baldwin, the author of Ctrl Alt Delete: How Politics and the Media Crashed Our Democracy, in the Sunday Times.“When they were told to pay for nationwide ads they regarded as madcap, such as one on voter registration, they made sure that few saw such messages except a tiny slice of left-wing activists.”Mr Baldwin, who was former leader Ed\u0026nbspMiliband’s director of communications, said that a former staffer told him: “If it was there for them, they thought it must be there for everyone. It\u0026nbspwasn’t. That’s how targeted ads can work.”The allegations caused anger and frustration among Corbyn loyalists, who said such behaviour\u0026nbspmay have cost Mr Corbyn the chance to oust Theresa May and enter Downing Street, rather than just obliterating her parliamentary majority.“Before the 2017 election, I remember rebutting endless stories that could only have come from selective leaking by HQ, so this latest revelation is no surprise,” Matt Zarb-Cousin, Jeremy Corbyn’s former spokesman, told The Independent.“If every member of staff at Labour HQ just got on with their jobs, Labour might be in government now. Thankfully, next time an election comes around everyone will be pulling in the same direction, giving Labour the best possible chance of winning.”This sense of frustration was echoed by various other party sources. “Our experiences with the press office were seriously unproductive and bordering on obstructionist while my boss was a shadow frontbencher,” said a Labour staffer.“Before the election it often felt like our shadow team were essentially expected to manage everything on our own with barely any money or coordination from Southside. Now things are being done far more professionally,” they said.Labour pull ahead in polls in wake of May publishing Brexit planJared O’Mara quits Labour Party over handling of tweets scandalGovernment should abandon ‘just say no’ drug policy, say Labour MPsThe claims demonstrate the isions within the Labour Party during the last election and corroborate\u0026nbsplongstanding accusations from left-wing activists that Blairite staffers sought to undermine Mr Corbyn’s campaign.UK news in picturesNovak Djokovic lifts the trophy after winning the men\u0027s singles final match against Kevin Anderson at WimbledonFar-right protesters demanding the release of jailed EDL founder Tommy Robinson brought chaos to central London after blockading a bus being driven by a woman in a headscarf during the marchUS President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa during their meeting at Chequers in BuckinghamshireUS President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive in the UKEngland manager Gareth Southgate and his players look dejected after they lost their World Cup semi final match against Croatia at Luzhniki Stadium in MoscowSerena Williams celebrates after winning against Camila Giorgi during their women\u0027s singles quarter-final match on the eighth day of Wimbledon.

UKIP rose by five points to eight per cent.If the results were repeated at a general election, the Tories would lose around 50 seats and Labour would be the largest party, albeit 26 seats short of a majority.Brexit: Donald Trump advised Theresa May to sue the EU, PM revealsMay warns Brexit may not happen \u0027at all\u0027 if Tory MPs rebelScientists should tackle Brexit, not politicians, says Brian CoxAnother poll, by Deltapoll for The Sun on Sunday, puts the Tories on 37 per cent and Labour on 42 per cent.It also suggested that 62 per cent of voters think Theresa May should stand down before the next general election.Only seven per cent of voters believed the Chequers plans was the best Brexit solution.Ian Lavery MP, chair of the Labour Party, said: “Theresa May’s so-called plan doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.“The Tories are botching Brexit, so the Prime Minister has resorted to shameless threats aimed at the British people.“No one – not the public, Parliament or the Conservative party – is happy with Theresa May’s offer. This has descended into a shambles.”Steve Baker MP, who resigned as Brexit minister after the Chequers summit, greeted the polls by tweeting: It looks like Chequers means Corbyn.Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told The Sun: This poll demonstrates, unsurprisingly, that voters have seen through the surrender paper.Theresa May has warned rebel Conservative MPs that Brexit might not happen at all if they do not back her plans.“We need to keep our eyes on the prize, she wrote in the Mail on Sunday.

They have come – and will continue to crowd in for the next two hours – for two main reasons.The first is because the choice of groceries inside this unrefurbished warehouse is phenomenal: crates of fruit and veg, baskets of breads, a deli counter offering pies and pates and pickles, tinned goods and cakes. Lots of cakes. Very occasionally, you can get blast chilled chicken from Nando’s here – “although,” says Smith, “it flies out the door pretty quick”.The second reason all these customers keep turning up is because of the price for everything in here: “Pay whatever you feel.”People come in, fill their baskets\u0026nbspand then hand over as much or as little money as they want. Some people do weekly shops for a fiver, and that’s fine.What’s the catch? There is one, of course. Everything here has been salvaged from supermarket bins, restaurant leftovers and wholesale market waste. Edibles otherwise marked for landfill have been saved and piled high. Smith once got called by a food bank with a surplus of donated tins and nowhere to store them. He collected them in his van, stuck them in store and watched them get snapped up.Local branches of Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and M\u0026ampS all have his team take their unwanted goods. Today\u0026nbspthere is an abundance of potatoes here. “Too wonky even for the wonky range,” Smith explains with a shrug.This, then, is the Real Junk Food Project, an enterprise created by the 32-year-old one-time executive chef with the aim of reducing the UK’s vast quantities of food waste, while helping people struggling – or simply seeking a bargain – in austerity Britain. And it’s proving more popular than he ever imagined.After he set up his first Sharehouse shop in Leeds in autumn 2016, the scheme has expanded at a rate the Big Four would be proud of. Six more stores have opened in the interim – this one in Sheffield, along with Birmingham, Brighton, Durham, Wigan and Chester – with three more, in Halifax, Wakefield and Keighley scheduled for late summer. Each one saves an estimated six tonnes of food from going to landfill every week. Along with a series of Real Junk Food cafes and Real Junk Food school projects (more of which shortly), Smith estimates that food goes to 25,000 people across the UK every week.And it’s all sorts of people too: families, old folks, millennials and\u0026nbspthe just about managing. Last month, this particular outlet had a massive batch of asparagus come in. “We put it on social media and it went a bit crazy,” says store manager Jo Hercberg. “We got a whole new foodie customer base from that.“We make no bones about what we offer,” she continues. “Our stock is what most shops would chuck out. Maybe it’s passed its best before date, maybe the lettuce has a browned at the edges, maybe a tin is dented. But we trust our customers to understand that. They do what human beings have always done: they use their sight and smell, and if something seems okay, they’ll have it.”The contradiction that inspired the Real Junk Food Project is a bizarre but real one. Every year, according to UN figures, 1.3 billion tonnes of food are thrown away. Yet, simultaneously, some 800 million people across the planet are malnourished.This paradoxical waste and want first struck Smith while working on an Australian farm five years ago. The surplus there was so pronounced they would feed courgettes to pigs because it was cheaper than buying feed.“But in Sydney there are hundreds of people on the streets who can’t afford to eat,” he says. “It’s that contradiction I want to solve.”Sharehouse store (The Real Junk Food Project)He returned to his home town of Leeds and founded the project. It was a cafe\u0026nbspat first, a single outlet opening for a couple of lunches a week in a converted corner shop in the city’s Armley district. But it used the same principle that\u0026nbspremains at the heart of the enterprise today.“Myself and volunteers persuaded local supermarkets to let us take what they were throwing out,” he explains. “It was pushing an open door because disposing of that waste costs money, so having someone come and take it was a win-win. Then we cooked it all up at the cafe.”Menus varied depending on what they were given: curries, lasagnes and\u0026nbsphot pots. Diners were told to pay what they wanted\u0026nbsp– or even asked to volunteer themselves – in return for the meal.\u0026nbsp“It was just an experiment,” says Smith. “We couldn’t believe how quickly it took off.”Within three months a second was opened by volunteers in Bristol. Then they kept opening. Today\u0026nbspthere are more than 120 worldwide, including in Germany, South Korea and Israel.Each new venue is given basic rules to follow – 90 per cent of food used should be designated waste, for instance – but, largely, they’re left to their own devices as part of a franchise system.The other thing which happened was Smith started receiving calls from places asking him to take their food waste – which finally led him to the idea of his supermarket-style shops.Meijer and Jo Hercberg at the\u0026nbspSharehouse store (The Real Junk Food Project)“We were getting too much food just for the cafes,” he says. “So why not sell it as pay-what-you-feel groceries? The variety of places it comes from, you wouldn’t believe. I got a call the other day from a shipping yard. Someone hadn’t paid rent on a container and they wanted it emptying. It was thousands of tins of peas.”He points it out in the warehouse, which is attached to the shop. “Want to take a couple of cans?” he asks.The shoppers here seem to love the place. They come in, browse, basket in hands, taking their time, asking volunteers question about produce and products.One is Fareesa Awan from\u0026nbspthe city’s nearby Burngreave\u0026nbspdistrict. “A friend told me about it,” she says. “She told me you go in looking for a bargain but end up walking out with a week’s worth of food. I thought, ‘That I have to try’. It’s wonderful. I don’t do my shopping here because you can’t always guarantee what they will have in but I’ll come and pick up some fruit, veg, cakes\u0026nbspfor the children – and my husband. I like to cook and there’s always something unusual here which you can pick up for next to nothing and then experiment with.”I ask if it bothers her that some of it is passed its best before date and she laughs. “I trust myself to decide what’s OK,” she says. “These dates – who decides them?\u0026nbspThey’re not necessary. Besides, once it’s in our house it does not last long. Big family, lots of visitors. The food soon goes, so it is good to get it cheap.”Back in store, the big question might be: just where does the money come from? Each shop typically has an average of 10 staff (along with dozens of volunteers) and requires large premises, so how does it fund itself?“With difficulty is the honest answer,” is Hercberg’s rueful reply.Each enterprise runs its own finances. Some run paid-for catering events. Others have contracts to provide after-school dinner clubs. One or two have been given council or charitable grants. Customers are often generous when paying for their shop.“But it’s a struggle,” says Hercberg. “There’s not much money giving away food – who’d have thought?”Legally, there have been issues too. The Real Junk Food Project works in the grey area of food regulation, and in April last year\u0026nbspthe Leeds store faced prosecution from West Yorkshire Trading Standards. It was found to have 444 items beyond their expiration date – distinct from “best before”\u0026nbspdates in that, while the latter is advisory only, it is illegal to supply a food which has passed the former.“But, as we said, our food has fed more than a million people and not one has ever reported getting ill,” says Smith. “So we know what we’re doing.”In the end, the project was given a slap on the wrist and told not to stock food beyond its expiration date in future. “I still don’t agree with that,” Smith says. “These dates are arbitrary. They’re there to scare you into buying more often, but this is the law so we comply.”UK news in picturesNovak Djokovic lifts the trophy after winning the men\u0027s singles final match against Kevin Anderson at WimbledonFar-right protesters demanding the release of jailed EDL founder Tommy Robinson brought chaos to central London after blockading a bus being driven by a woman in a headscarf during the marchUS President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa during their meeting at Chequers in BuckinghamshireUS President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive in the UKEngland manager Gareth Southgate and his players look dejected after they lost their World Cup semi final match against Croatia at Luzhniki Stadium in MoscowSerena Williams celebrates after winning against Camila Giorgi during their women\u0027s singles quarter-final match on the eighth day of Wimbledon.

I’ve spoke to party leaders – I won’t say who – and they’ve told me there’s no votes in this. I’ve been invited down to Westminster but I’ve stopped going. They listen, ask questions, and then do nothing.”He thinks about it all for a moment and, here, amid mountainous piles of pesto and mayonnaise, seems momentarily overwhelmed.“But we keep at it,” he says. “I’ve been doing some consultancy work with a supermarket. Their managers in London got alarmed by how much food they were giving us every day. I think they calculated it up and realised how much money they must be losing by throwing so much stuff out. So, they asked us in as a consultancy to help them reduce their waste. That will mean less for us to take away each day but that’s a good thing.”Again he pauses, offers me my pick from a crate of olives. “I suppose the ultimate aim would be to put ourselves out of business because there is no more food waste,” he says. “If we ever achieve that, then I’ll consider it a job done.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

CCTV footage shows the attack and moment he was left for dead.The tragic death that triggered the #JusticeJunior campaign has inspired New York State Senator Luis Sepúlveda and Assemblyman Victor Pichardo to propose Safe Havens for Endangered Children legislations, also called \u0027Junior\u0027s Law\u0027.Speaking alongside some of Junior’s family members outside at a press conference at the bodega where he sought help, Mr Sepulveda said more needed to be done to protect children in danger.We want to make sure that any business owner or their employees who encounter a situation involving a minor who has been abused or may be in danger has a duty to try to help,” he said. Community businesses should be safe havens for our youth. They should promptly notify police.”\u0026nbspHe added that another measure of the bill would ensure that small businesses to have first aid kits on hand “to help those who are injured to save lives”.The proposed bill has the support of Junior’s father Lissandro Guzman, who said in a statement: I feel very content and with all my heart I hope the bill that carries my son\u0027s name gets passed so it can prevent situations like this from happening again and so we can create more security for our beloved children.”If passed, businesses that fails to “provide a safe refuge for a child who had physical injury inflicted upon him or is in imminent danger of such injury until authorities arrive,” would face penalties.In the wake of Junior’s murder much of the anger was directed at the bodega, where he had sought refuge from the gang members. Surveillance footage from inside the Cruz and Chiky Grocery store showed the moment he rushed\u0026nbspinto the store and jumped over the counter.Store owner Modesto Cruz said at the time that he tried to help the teen by letting him hide behind the counter, but the gang threatened him.World news in picturesHugo Lloris lifts the trophy after France beat Croatia 4-2 in the World Cup final in the Luzhniki Stadium in RussiaGermany\u0027s Angelique Kerber beat seven-time champion US player Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final.

Beaten and kicked by his pitiless owner then left to starve and cower in a filthy cage, the world only found out about his sorry life of abuse when heartbreaking images emerged on social media.

Our rescued circus lions Jora and Black live nearby and when they saw King, they gave him a welcoming roar that was taken up by all the other lions at the centre. We gave him some food, he took some water, and then he headed off into the thick bush at the back of his enclosure.NCKing taking a few exuberant steps in the land of his ancestorsAlthough King\u0026rsquos vast new home has plenty of natural scrub habitat he can never be truly free. Having been born in captivity, he does not have the natural instincts to survive in the unforgiving wilderness.\u0026ldquoKing was an innocent victim of the appalling trade in exotic \u0026lsquopets\u0026rsquo and will now live a life free from harm at our sanctuary, says Dr Draper. \u0026ldquoHowever, millions of wild animals worldwide are not so lucky, and are forced to endure miserable lives in captivity as \u0026lsquopets\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoWild animals fare very poorly in a domestic environment and are particularly susceptible to welfare problems when kept as pets. Born Free is working hard to end this cruel and wasteful trade and to ensure that we keep wildlife in the wild.For Virginia McKenna OBE, Born Free\u0026rsquos co-founder and star of the eponymous 1966 film about the challenge of freeing Elsa the lioness, King\u0026rsquos return to Africa struck a poignant note. \u0026ldquoSo many people responded to our appeal to bring young King to Shamwari, and now he has arrived, she says. \u0026ldquoThanks to everyone whose hearts were touched by his story he now takes his first steps on African soil, and can begin his happy new life.

She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and died a few days later. Gemma was just 40 years old.Simon had to tell their eight- year-old son Ethan that his mum was dead, and the two of them have been trying to cope ever since.Everyone mourns the death of someone they have loved and adored in different ways.There’s no timetable for grief, and no “one size fits all” way to get through the whole soul-crushing experience. For Simon, the death of his wife felt like a physical illness and being in intensive care.He decided to leave his job at Sky Sports to be with Ethan full time and they now both have an unbreakable bond.Simon is obviously very ­protective of his young son, but that works both ways.Ethan will often tell his dad that he is OK even when he is really suffering and missing his mum, because he doesn’t want Simon to worry about him, or to add to his dad’s pain.He sounds like a remarkable young lad who is a credit to both of his parents.For Simon, one of the worst things about Gemma’s death is the acute loneliness.After he has put Ethan to bed and he is in the living room, there’s no Gemma on the sofa watching TV or just chatting about the mundane events of the day.He often breaks down while making dinner for two rather than three, or emptying the dishwasher or doing other household tasks they used to share but that he now has to do by himself.It’s those little things that bind us together, and that we miss so very much.Simon told me that there are those who have simply not been in touch since Gemma died. It’s not because they don’t care, but because they just don’t know what to say to him and Ethan.It was interesting to hear him say that the most comforting sympathy he received was from a woman he bumped into in the supermarket, who knew Gemma from meeting her at the school gate.She simply told him that it was “utter crap, totally unfair and completely f*****g hellish”.And it is.When someone you love dies, it is utterly s**t and it does no harm to say that.Telling a bereaved person you are sorry for their “loss” is well meaning and comes with the best possible intentions, but we “lose” car keys, credit cards and dog leads.Those we loved are ripped from our arms and our hearts and it feels like the end of the world.Those feelings don’t really ever go away — you just somehow learn to live with them.We need to somehow try to make that process more bearable. So don’t avoid a devastated husband, a mother whose child has died or an elderly widow who is mourning her soul-mate.Talk to them and check in with them, because one day you will need them to comfort you.Essie, portrayed by Kaye Wragg, above, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo a complete hysterectomy, giving her no chance of ever having a much-yearned-for child of her own.Kaye gave her usual cracking performance, utterly believable and deeply moving. This storyline will have helped raise awareness of a cancer that is known as the “silent killer”.I hope we see more of Essie, as I always looked upon her as the quiet heart of Holby.If you missed this episode, make sure you go to the BBC iPlayer to catch up.WE’VE all had them – those house guests who overstay their welcome and are a complete pain in the bum.The disgruntled visitors who don’t like the food and complain the bed is too hard and won’t do a hand’s turn to help with the dishes or buy the odd loaf or bottle of wine.The ones where you do a jig when they have left and vow: “Never again.”So I sympathise with poor Mr and Mrs May, who have been putting up with the Trumps – veritable guests from hell.He’s the worst possible bullying boaster and you can imagine him dominating the conversation and being demanding and boorish.She has all the personality of a fembot and looks bored and disinterested at all times.Having the Trumps to stay was never going to be the easiest of rides for our PM and her husband.Aside from the thorny political discussions – and this week he has ripped up the rulebook and sold her down the river – there’s the distressing business of making small talk with this odd couple.I can just imagine Donald blowharding and manaplaining over pre- dinner drinks while poor Theresa becomes even more strained and develops a red stress rash on her neck.Her hubby Philip probably ended up talking to Melania about the weather.Trump has to be kept entertained like some bored little emperor, but you don’t want him to have too good a time that he will want to visit again soon.It’s a thorny one.Theresa has had the toughest of times recently, but she is made of strong stuff. While she might look a little tired around the eyes, our PM is no quitter – unlike the men who have let her down and put their own interests above those of the country.It might be trivial but I hope our PM can take some comfort in the fact she looked sensational in that sizzling red dress she wore to greet Trump.Theresa won the style battle with much younger ex-model Melania, who looked like a cut-price Belle from Disney’s Beauty And The Beast.Although Trump got it spot on as the Beast.FOR once this week, it wasn’t some poor actress who’d eaten a bowl of pasta for lunch and had a small, rounded belly being body-shamed.Russell Crowe was the subject of gleeful mirth by people who feel better about themselves by mocking others.Admittedly, the former buff star of Gladiator has piled on the pounds and looks like Thomas Markle’s older, larger brother. But by all accounts he’s chunked up for a movie role.Gladiator was 18 years ago and even Hollywood stars grow older and bigger. It appears, however, that equality in Tinseltown now means both women AND men being derided for not remaining visions of perfection and having the audacity to age.TODAY Serena Williams strides on to Centre Court to play for her eighth Wimbledon Ladies singles title.I have never seen a more majestic athlete on a tennis court since the heady days of my girl crush, Martina Navratilova.Serena is simply sensational and being a mother has made her even more hungry to win.It’s astonishing to think that just ten months ago, after the traumatic birth of her daughter and following multiple surgeries, she could hardly walk.Despite all she has gone through, I’ve never seen any athlete better prepared physically but also mentally.Serena can taste that title and no one is going to get in her way.I don’t envy her opponent, Angelique Kerber, today as it’s not just Wimbledon up for grabs.Serena also has her 24th singles grand slam in her sights, which would equal the record set by Margaret Court.Mrs Court was a hell of a tennis player but, as it turns out, not a great human being.She is a self-styled pastor in Australia and her views on gay rights and same-sex marriage are deeply distasteful.She claimed transgender children are the work of the devil, leading Martina Navratilova to label her “racist and homophobic”.So for that and so many other reasons, I’m firmly backing Serena today.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was also Donald Trump’s view in The Sun.But yesterday the PM convinced him otherwise. And she insisted “there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the world”.How are both positions possible? How will we enjoy such flexibility?How will our courts be supreme if we still heed ECJ rulings? How will we have total control of immigration if some EU workers can still come in as they see fit? And what will she do next if Brussels rejects it all?Leave voters’ rising anger is fuelled by the suspicion that behind the repeated assurances we are being stitched up.Mrs May must explain why we’re not. Explain how she talked round a doubting Trump. Explain how we will seize the opportunities Brexit presents. If she wants to admit her plan isn’t ideal but it’s the best there is, this is her moment.It’s time for honesty, not spin. The PM owes it to Britain. DO Remainers really not get the difference between President Obama giving his view on Brexit and President Trump doing so?Obama was egged on by Downing Street in 2016 to try to skew a democratic vote in favour of one side. He told us, falsely, that backing Brexit would put us last in the queue for a US trade deal.Trump’s argument in The Sun two years AFTER the vote was simply that Leave won and he doubted Mrs May’s strategy would fulfil on the verdict.He may be wrong. But Obama definitely was. Because once Trump replaced him, Britain hit the front of the US queue — a position only now threatened by staying tied to Brussels.Happy to help, Remain fans. WE wondered if President Trump might try to shoot the messenger when he realised how embarrassing his world exclusive Sun interview was to his host Mrs May.We’re used to that, of course. We’re not as used to seeing Mr Trump have the grace to back down when one of his “fake news” jibes is proved wrong, as it was yesterday.That’s not just a special moment. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Just as it happened, I turned my head to see it just drop to the floor and smash everywhere.Instinctively we got up to investigate what happened and it dawned on us that it had to have been the heat that smashed the glass.He continued: At that point then it was a matter of Oh my god, how are we going to pick all this up? because it had shattered into so many pieces and some of the shards were a metre away from the table so we knew this had actually exploded and not just shattered.David said as the eight-piece Miami table set, which they bought a year and a half ago, was sitting on grass, it took three days to pick up the tiny fragments of glass.He said: Myself and my wife were cutting our fingers open trying to pick all the glass because we didnt want the kids playing anywhere near it.Its crazy, you dont think about this when youre buying a table set at all. I would have thought in this day and age there would be a protective lawyer or film on it so if it ever smashed or cracked that it would still stay together, I didnt think it would shatter into a million tiny fragments, he said.He added: Its lucky we werent sitting there. Its crazy to think that only a couple of days before we were all sitting there eating at the table. Obviously if that had happened while one of my kids was leaning on it, they would have been straight through it into all that glass.It comes after outraged mum Paige Angela Tompkins from Leicester hit out at Asda after her table from the same Miami range burst into shattered glassed on her decking.He continued: “When I called them initially they didn’t seem that interested, they told me, ‘You won’t be getting a refund.“I was shocked that they didn’t at least apologise and didn’t want to recall the tables.”A spokesperson for Asda told The Sun Online: We take no shortcuts when it comes to the safety of our products, which is why we only use toughened glass in our garden furniture and test to both British and European safety standards - meaning incidents like this are rare.Wed like to reassure all our customers that this product has passed all safety requirements and of the 45,000 glass top tables we sell each year there have only been a handful of examples when this has happened.The danger of exploding glass in patio tables was highlighted by The Sun last year.Experts suggested they shatter as glass expands and contracts in hot weather."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000330217827.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tory chiefs hatch daring plan to keep may in power","story":"The Prime Minister told rival rebel camps they risk undermining any chances of a deal with Brussels if they do not back her exit plan.She called for her MPs to take a practical and pragmatic approach or we face a “damaging and disorderly” withdrawal from the EU.She told pro and anti-EU sides within the Tory party that there was no other “workable alternative future trading relationship” to her Chequers blueprint.In a bullish appeal, she said “we must keep our eyes on the prize” and added: “If we don’t, we risk ending up with no Brexit at all.”Mrs May said: “This is a time to be practical and pragmatic.” The PM came out fighting after Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson both quit last week over her Chequers plan.Mrs May revealed her party needed to come together behind the proposals ahead of crucial Commons votes on key Brexit legislation this week.She hit out at those who want to keep Britain tied to a permanent customs union.Mrs May also said changes backed by the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group would put at risk the Government’s plans for a “no deal scenario”.She said it could leave Britain unable to benefit from 40 existing trade arrangements.And she sent a warning shot to Brussels, saying her Brexit deal is a “complete plan with a set of outcomes that are non-negotiable” in a Mail on Sunday article.The PM insists it will restore our national sovereignty, end vast payments to the EU and “grasp the opportunities” of an independent trade policy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In pubs, in shop windows, on cars, on scaffolding, on hats and shirts and flying above 10 Downing Street.And nobody was sneering at our flag now. Just guessing, but I doubt if anyone will be sneering at that flag any time soon.Not even Labour’s Emily Thornberry.What a ride. What a month-long high. What an adventure for those of us who are old enough to remember 1966 and also for the children who will remember this as the first World Cup they watched.Fifty years from today, those kids will still remember how they felt when England won a penalty shootout against Colombia, and when Kieran Trippier bent it better than Beckham after five minutes against Croatia.And they will remember to their dying day exactly what it felt like when we knew that England was not going to the final.The tears are real but so is the pride. And the pride — even more than the disappointment — is the overwhelming emotion today.England played with big hearts, true grit and the fearlessness of youth.They come home not as legends to rival the boys of 1966 but with their heads held high. Their nation is proud of them.And yes, it is only a game. It is not a war. Nobody died.But at a time when our nation is more horribly divided than at any time in modern history, we were reminded what a great country this still is, and how much we have to be proud of, and how much there is to love.And it was not your imagination — England was united once again.“Our country has been through difficult times in terms of unity,” said England’s young manager in his thoughtful, softly spoken manner.“Sport — football in particular — has the power to help that.“We’re a team that, with our diversity and our youth, represents modern England.In England, we have spent a bit of time being a bit lost as to what our modern identity is. I think we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”Gareth Southgate is right about the healing power of sport. This World Cup brought us together in a way we’ve not experienced since the London 2012 Olympics.But 2012 was before the bitter wounds of Brexit.It is Gareth Southgate himself who is the main reason this country has rallied around this England team.Southgate with his courtesy, his decency and his Yoda-like intelligence.Southgate,  who talks about “owning the process” and “managing our energy” — it is quite difficult to imagine the former England manager, Big Sam Allardyce, being comfortable with that kind of 21st Century dialogue. Southgate with his dapper shirt, tie and waistcoat combo, as suave as a suburban James Bond.Southgate who carries himself as if he is the living embodiment of Rudyard Kipling’s most famous poem.“If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those imposters just the same . . . you will be a man, my son!”Even as England were celebrating their very first win in a World Cup penalty shootout, Southgate took time to comfort Mateus Uribe, one of the two Colombian players who had missed their penalty.This was more than an act of sportsmanship. It was an act of humanity.Because we all knew that Southgate has been there.The abiding memory of Gareth Southgate as a player — the one moment that everyone remembers — is in Euro 1996, with his shoulders sagging inside a grey England shirt and his spirit smashed after missing a penalty (we never recall the players who were too cowardly to step up and take a penalty — history gives them a pass).Stuart “Psycho” Pearce had known penalty redemption — missing in Italia 1990 but scoring in Euro 1996. Southgate’s redemption has been infinitely more convoluted.There was an image that went viral of the 25-year-old Gareth Southgate after just missing a penalty in 1996 being comforted by the 47-year-old Gareth Southgate who shook up the world in Russia in 2018.If this World Cup has gone some way to healing our divided nation, it has also gone a long way to healing the pain that Southgate has endured for half a lifetime.It is true what they say ­— success is not final, failure is not fatal.The manager was well served by this young team, who were light years away from the central casting image of the Premier League footballer — the pampered, wag-shagging, blingtastic, Bentley-crashing, multi-millionaire airhead.These England footballers — even the star striker, Harry Kane, who would cost a minimum £100million if Real Madrid came knocking — were clearly of and from the working class.They hail, every one of them, from modest beginnings. Most of the squad — 15 — paid their Premier League dues while out on loan in the lump-kicking lower leagues.“Barnsley, Leeds, Bolton, Blackburn,” said Southgate. “We’re lads who have come from those places.”This England team are not ordinary boys — they are elite professional athletes — but they have all been ordinary boys, and there was a humility about them, a work ethic and total lack of pretension that made you believe they will never forget their roots.And if they come from everywhere from the North East to Yorkshire to the Essex/East End borders, they also come from every kind of family.There were those who grew up in solid nuclear families with both mum and dad and siblings present, and those who were raised by single mums, and those who are from domestic chaos.Raheem Sterling’s father was murdered in Jamaica when he was two, and Dele Alli escaped the turmoil of his riven family life by moving in with his best friend’s family when he was 13.Their backstories are as diverse as our nation, but every one of them has grafted to get to the top.Sterling was berated for having an assault rifle tattooed on his leg but nobody ran harder or longer for the England cause than Raheem.When you watched his mesmeric, lung-busting runs, how could you not warm to him?How could you not forgive one dumb tatt?“Good lads,” said Southgate of his England squad, those boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne, from Bury and Leeds and Sheffield, and once again he said it all.They are good lads and we cheered them, and celebrated with them, and in the end, we shared their pain because it was our pain too, even in defeat against Belgium yesterday.They were a band of brothers and for one magical sun-drenched summer month, they lit up our nation.This World Cup was a roller-coaster ride that grabbed you by the scruff of your replica Three Lions shirt from the first match against Tunisia and refused to let go until the end of extra time against Croatia.They came SO CLOSE — Croatia led England for 11 minutes.That’s how agonisingly near we were to saying, “Bonjour, Monsieur,” in today’s World Cup final.It was gloriously entertaining, but it was also far more than just entertainment.It felt like Gareth Southgate and that young England team represented the very best of us.We learned — or we were reminded — that decency is not weakness, sportsmanship is not soft, and you need never feel one twinge of shame if you give your all.And we learned that we love our national game with a passion that can never be denied.I honestly thought we would win it.Typical England fan!I believed that this was the year we added the second World Cup winner’s gold star to the team shirt.When the England players were chucking around rubber chickens at a training session just before the Croatia semi-final, I thought it was a tension-busting masterstroke.It wasn’t to be.But this England team have been through the full range of human emotions — from joy to despair, hope to disappointment, and this country has been with them every step of the way.The struggle continues, the dream will never die.I reckon 50,000 England football fans will already be making plans to go to Qatar in 2022.This World Cup will be remembered for breaking our hearts and uniting our nation.And a grateful, emotionally exhausted country has just two words for those Three Lions.Thank you. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One able to set its own laws and control its borders.The idea of taking diktats from European courts, having no border control, and being unable to strike free trade deals — while paying Brussels £39billion — is not the Brexit people voted for.Mrs May should look at our poll today to see the bloody nose the Tories could be dealt at the next General Election.Unless she starts being honest with the country, then she will cause further disillusionment among voters, potentially opening the door to Jeremy Corbyn…Ushering in Britain’s first Marxist PM should not be a legacy Mrs May wants. EXPECTATIONS were not high before the World Cup began — for once.With the pressure lifted off the players’ shoulders — combined with Gareth Southgate’s leadership — our boys played with passion and determination.Despite yesterday’s loss to Belgium, they were real ambassadors for England.Meanwhile, the FA are set to apply for the 2030 World Cup.

The Hymns were O Jesus, I Have Promised and Lord of All Hopefulness.The lessons were from Mark 10: 13-16, read by godparents Lucy Middleton and Ephesians 3: 14-19, read by Guy Pelly.The anthems were This is the day which the Lord hath made, which was composed for the Cambridges Wedding in 2011, and Suo Gân, a traditional Welsh lullaby.Both were performed by The Choir of Her Majestys Chapel Royal.The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh did not attend the christening however, after a busy week of high-profile events in central London and ahead of a visit by US President Donald Trump.Kensington Palace said that the Queens non-attendance is not related to illness, but was mutually agreed some time ago.The christening was described as a small affair with immediate family and godparents.The godparents are close friends of the royal couple Nicholas van Cutsem, Mr Pelly, Harry Aubrey-Fletcher, Lady Laura Meade, Hannah Gillingham and Miss Middleton to be godparents for their youngest child.The photographer who took the snap, Matt Holyoak said: I was truly honoured at being asked to take the official photographs at the christening of Prince Louis, and to witness at first hand such a happy event.“Everyone was so relaxed and in such good spirits, it was an absolute pleasure. I only hope I have captured some of that joy in my photographs. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It seems they are gearing up.”The cap, backed by The Sun’s People Power energy campaign, would place a ceiling on an estimated 11million so-called standard variable tariffs (SVTs) for up to five years.In the letter seen by the Sun, Ms Perry tells the Big Six: “Value, choice and excellent consumer service should be at the heart of this.“Sadly,  it is evident that for many consumers that has not been the case.“The Government will strongly condemn any efforts to frustrate the process of putting the cap in place. Digging in to defend a hold on legacy customer groups and out-of-date practices, rather than embracing change, will only harm loyal customers. And it risks damaging the reputation of the whole sector.”A source added: “Ministers and the public will not stand for any supplier who tries to hold this up.“Suppliers should see the writing on the wall and help make this work.”The Sun demanded a crackdown on the Big Six two years ago when we revealed their SVTs were ripping off families by nearly £400 a year.Business Secretary Greg Clark accused the energy giants of “milking” millions of loyal, older customers so it could launch cut-price online deals.Iain Conn, head of British Gas-owner Centrica, blamed the price cap for 4,000 job cuts in February and has been an outspoken critic of the legislation.The Big Six have incensed critics by raising prices despite the planned cap.EDF announced a six per cent hike for electricity and gas prices last week — its second of the year.There are fears that the Big Six could drag the process out by taking legal action.

Give us the rationale for this action.A second device was thrown at the home of the partys former Northern Ireland chairman Bobby Storey.Gerry Kelly, Sinn Feins Policing and Justice spokesman, said: These were reprehensible and cowardly attacks on the family homes of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey.Grandchildren were in the driveway of Adams home minutes before the attack.I would appeal for calm. These attacks are the desperate acts of increasingly desperate and irrelevant groups.The Police Service of Northern Ireland said officers were dealing with two incidents at two separate addresses in west Belfast.Police said the devices thrown at both homes were believed to be large industrial or commercial fireworks.Mr Adams, 69, tweeted that he was unharmed and thanked his Neighbourhood Watch for sounding the alarm.He posted: All well here. No one hurt. Thanks 4 all the texts and phone calls.Thanks 2 all the great neighbours, the Neighbourhood Watch and Sinn Féin reps who were here very quickly.While police have not yet attributed responsibility, the attacks are likely the work of dissident republicans.The extremist groups oppose Sinn Feins involvement in the peace process and are engaged in localised turf wars in republican strongholds in an effort to wrest support away from the mainstream movement.Fridays attacks in west Belfast came six straight nights of violence in Northern Ireland, where explosive devices were hurled at cops.Northern Ireland’s chief of police George Hamilton has blamed a New IRA in Derry for the murderous attacks on police.On Thursday night, two explosive devices were hurled at police officers, and 74 petrol bombs were also thrown.Three men were arrested, one on suspicion of attempted murder. One, aged 50, was later charged with disorderly behaviour.Police said it was “nothing short of a miracle” that no one has been injured or killed so far.High tensions have been blamed on the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne.It is understood some of those involved in the violence are not even in their teenage years.Mr Adams led Sinn Fein from 1983 until February 2018, while Mr Storey has served as the partys northern chairman.Mr Storey was involved in the Maze Prison escape in 1983, where 38 IRA prisoners escaped from the maximum security prison.Following the attacks, the leader of the Alliance party Naomi Long tweeted: It seems this week some people are determined to drag us back into violence at whatever cost.We need to stand together against all violence.

The married Tory minister said his messages were sent during a period of great personal pressure, claiming that they do not represent his views. The married father-of-one - whose daughter Alice was born just three months ago - resigned from his post as minister for small business on Friday ahead of revelations in the Sunday Mirror about the lewd messages today.  He has now told the Burton Mail his priority is rebuilding the trust of his family and says he will work hard to ensure people in Burton and Uttoxeter can also trust him again.   Andrew Griffiths\u0027 statement in full reads: “I would like to personally apologise to everyone in Burton and Uttoxeter for my actions over a two-week period. The messages were written during a period of great personal pressure and in no way represent my views or actions. “I have chosen to resign as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Small Business as my behaviour fell well below the standards expected of me. “I hope that people will judge me on my actions and achievements during eight years as Member of Parliament for Burton and Uttoxeter rather than a few moments of stupidity. “My priority now is my family, and rebuilding their trust. I hope that Kate and Alice will be able to forgive me for the distress and upset I have caused them, and I am determined to do whatever it takes.  “I am undertaking professional treatment to ensure I never make the same mistake again. I am grateful for the messages of support and understanding that I have received. “No casework will slip and everything will be dealt with fully while I am seeking help. My greatest honour is to be your Member of Parliament. I will continue to work hard for the people of Burton and Uttoxeter, and to restore their trust in me.” Text messages revealed by the Sunday Mirror show his conversations with Imogen Treharne and another woman. His contact with Imogen and her friend – who has not been named – began one hour after she posted a “racy” video on Snapchat at 7pm on June 16.

When Imogen Treharne asked the married dad if he had many \u0026shygirlfriends, he told her: “I get lots of offers. Power is an aphrodisiac.” The swaggering small business minister was so sure of himself he even used his work mobile to beg Imogen and her pal for naked photos and trysts with them both. Tonight his political career was in tatters as he quit in disgrace. Theresa May saw him as a close friend and champion of women who campaigned for more female MPs. But in reality the Burton MP was little more than a slavering pervert who certainly mixed small business with his own seedy pleasure in the House of Commons.  When he wasn’t voting or in debates, he was popping out to send sordid messages from “Daddy” to the two women he had met on social media. And in between he tried to impress them by boasting about the famous and powerful people he knew. He sent one of the girls a selfie outside Buckingham Palace and shared pictures from inside, saying: “Daddy met the future king tonight: but thought of you.” On June 27, referring to himself as Daddy, he said he had been up making speeches and “running the country” but he wanted to be “licking naughty girls…” And he told one of the girls: “I’m the daddy with power. I’m the daddy with the naughtiest streak.” The MP who campaigned for upskirting to be outlawed, revealed his hypocrisy in one message to Imogen and her friend which said: “I want to be able to lift your skirts over dinner and show my friends.”  On June 20, 25 minutes after voting on the EU Withdrawal Bill, he messaged Imogen to say: “Hey… I’m good, Need distracting.” When she asked why, he replied: “Stressful day… Work work work.’ On June 26, he voted four times in Parliament on EU Trade and Partnership Agreement Orders as well as the Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill. But he still found time to send sex texts saying: “Show daddy something filthy. I think I’ve earned it.” He also managed to wire the girls \u0026pound200 for ‘treats’ remarking: “A horny daddy is a generous daddy.”  Two minutes before the last vote that day at 4.22pm he wrote: “I’m good. I thought you had forgotten daddy. And minutes later, at 4.29pm, he asked Imogen for filthy photos requesting even more explicit images, begging: “Are you going to show me?” On the morning of July 4, he told Imogen he wanted to have sex with her before going on to vote on the Ivory Bill that afternoon. When he wasn’t exhausting himself with his sordid messages he found time to keep reminding the girls of his links to power and celebrity. He sent Imogen an image of the House of Commons terrace bar at sunset and bragged about being able to provide money for the girls if they needed it, telling Imogen’s friend: “If you need money you just need to ask....it’s fine baby, tell me what you want and I will arrange something. But I’m going to need something f**king filthy to put a smile on my face first, I want to see you both naked.”  He admitted to the girls he love the way they looked and then asked: “Would you have thought I was such a naughty man?” Mr \u0026shyGriffiths bragged how his position as a former banker meant he knew singer Katherine Jenkins. He sent a series of photos of himself at ministerial engagements and top awards dinners, and bragged he had raised \u0026pound200,000 for terminally ill children at a dinner with Katie Price. In public, the MP – who lives with wife Kate and their three-month old daughter Alice in his constituency of Burton and Uttoxeter – loves to play the traditional family man. He voted against same sex marriage in 2013. He once wrote in his local paper: “For most people, their number one priority in life is looking after their family and making sure they are healthy and happy.” On another occasion when addressing how to give children the best life chances possible, he declared: “There is no better way to start that than in a loving, permanent family.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kevin maguire theresa must stop","story":"NewsopinionKevin Maguire: Theresa May must stop Britain from becoming Donald Trump\u0027s 51st stateShe was spineless enough to keep clutching his paw, but the Prime Minister knows that Remaining with the EU is preferable to Trump and his America First trade deal\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor22:03, 15 JUL 2018NewsopinionHow can Theresa May manage to get a good deal for us without Trump?

The rogue US President abused the Prime Minister’s hospitality and brought tens of thousands of protesters on to the streets. His rudeness and lies are the toxic ravings of an unstable man-child and reinforce the need for Britain to stay close to our European allies. May’s disclosure that the advice from the deranged six-time bankrupt manchild in the White House was the infeasible suing of the EU was her way of letting us know even she thinks unhinged Trump’s a turkey leg short of the full Thanksgiving feast. Downing Street, desperate to avoid May falling, is pitching the line that it’s her Brexit or no Brexit at all, plus Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn. Tory hardline Brextremists led by Boris Johnson – who was laughed at by MPs as they watched him search in vain for the Foreign Office limo he lost on quitting – are gauging their ability to knock May over.  What’s clear from her controversial 98-page Brexit white paper is that she finally recognises European reality trumps American free trade fantasies. Britain would be poorer and weaker, stripped of influence and with its sovereignty eroded should she triumph. Our current membership of the European club is superior to any Leave option. Behind the meaningless “Brexit means Brexit” propaganda, May is acknowledging that sacrificing our manufacturing industry on the ideological altar of Brexit fanaticism would be ruinous. She’ll reduce national clout by pulling out of the Brussels institutions next March – and not travel very far.

The married Tory – who has owned up to his behaviour and resigned his post – referred to Imogen and a friend as the “ti**y twins” and suggested a string of depraved acts. He sent 2,000 texts over three weeks after becoming pals on social media. But what started as harmless flirting rapidly turned into a barrage of perverted demands. The MP sent the girls money in return for X-rated pictures and videos. He asked them to tie each other up and boasted: “I can be an evil ******* when I’m turned on.” Imogen, 28, told the Sunday Mirror: “I wanted him to be a nice guy, but by the end I felt dirty. I felt like I was being used for this wealthy man’s gratification.”  Imogen revealed how Griffiths boasted he had beaten women during sex sessions, asked her to beat her friend for his pleasure and paid them more than \u0026pound700 – asking for nude pictures and videos in return. Imogen said: “Nobody has ever sent me that many texts in the space of three weeks. Nobody I’ve not met in real life. I had to put my phone on its airplane mode because of it. “It was draining my battery. It was shocking – I wondered how he was able to send so many messages? Where was he, how did he have the freedom to do it constantly? It was as soon as he woke up and as soon as he went to bed. How did he have time to do any work?” Imogen admitted she and her friend sent 47-year-old Mr Griffiths explicit videos and accepted his money – but became turned off by his behaviour and hypocrisy. Mr Griffiths – chief of staff to PM Theresa May when the Tories were in opposition – helped set up the Women2Win group which campaigned for more female MPs.  Imogen went on: “He’s an interesting, smart guy and I tried to engage in conversation about his work. “But he’d say he found it boring and move it on to something else. He didn’t want to speak to me about anything other than sex.” His contact with Imogen and her friend – who we are not naming – began one hour after she posted a “racy” video on Snapchat at 7pm on June 16. He had been following the two women on Snapchat and \u0026shyFacebook for six months after seeing Imogen’s friend at work while out in his constituency. Instagram allows users to see who has been viewing their videos. It showed Griffiths was among the two girls’ biggest “fans” – watching them over and over again in the months before he made contact. Griffiths – whose wife Kate, 47, had their first child in April –said he wanted to use WhatsApp because he could keep her pictures to look at later. He then discussed a threesome with Imogen’s friend.  A group chat was set up on the \u0026shyFacebook Messenger service. Between the various platforms he sent more than 2,000 messages. He arranged the transfer of six payments totalling \u0026pound717 to an account used by Imogen’s friend. In return he asked for them to send him images and videos. On June 17 – the day after he first contacted Imogen – Mr \u0026shyGriffiths made reference to the fact it was Father’s Day, adding: “Daddy’s get treats. Do you think Daddy deserves a treat?” Daddy is a term used in bondage relationships. On the same day he appeared on a BBC political show. At 4.24pm he tweeted a message to followers thanking the NHS for the care they gave his daughter.  But at the same time he was messaging Imogen, asking if she was into “older men”. Then, at 4.30pm, he said his Father’s Day was going “perfectly”, before adding: “I just wish my little girl was sat on my knee. With those big t*ts in my face.” At 1am on June 22 Mr \u0026shyGriffiths boasted he had hosted a charity dinner for terminally ill children with TV celebrity Katie Price. He said: “She looks ridiculous. New facelift. Looks like a cat. But we raised \u0026pound200k for terminal kids.” On June 23, Mr Griffiths offered to rent an apartment so he could meet the girls for sex. And on June 24 he fantasised about violent sex with the girls, offering to buy matching outfits and to take them lingerie shopping. He said: “Daddy doesn’t know the prices of dresses and panties so why don’t you suggest a budget?”  The visit never took place, but the next day, amid more explicit messages, he said: “Daddy has been up making speeches and running the country. But what he really wants to be doing is ******* naughty girls’ *******.” The following day, on June 28, Burton and Uttoxeter MP Mr Griffiths sent a selfie from outside Buckingham Palace during a visit to meet Prince Charles. He also uploaded a picture of an area of the Palace not open to the public that day and told the girls: “Sadly the Queen is ill”, before adding “I think the Queen is fine, just under the weather.” One of the MP’s payments was for Imogen to buy a dress. But he wrote: “Take off the bra \u0026amp panties and I will transfer. You’ve got Daddy in such a frenzy. If you look pretty in it , I want you to wear it often. I like you to turn heads. “Make the vid and pics naughty and you can have your dress.”    “I’m going to bring you to London and do whatever I want to you.” “I’m thinking maybe we need a flat for Daddy’s girls. I’m taken by you both. You girls are spectacular.” “I’m the daddy with power. I’m the daddy with the naughtiest streak.” “I want to be able to lift your skirts over dinner and show my friends.” Sent with a selfie outside Buckingham Palace: “Daddy met the future king tonight: but thought of you.” “A horny daddy is a generous daddy.”  “If you need money you just need to ask....it’s fine baby, tell me what you want and I will arrange something. But I’m going to need something f**king filthy to put a smile on my face first, I want to see you both naked.” Would you have thought I was such a naughty man?”  "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror sleazy mp andrew","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Sleazy MP Andrew Griffiths is a moral vacuum living in denialMP has resigned as minister but he\u0027s clearly too blinkered to see just how depraved his \"few moments of stupidity\" were and the extent of the damage he\u0027s done\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByVoice of the Mirror22:43, 15 JUL 2018NewsopinionAndrew Griffiths is clinging on to his role as MP for Burton despite the disgusting revelations last weekend (Image: Chris McAndrew / UK Parliament)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIf shamed Tory sexual predator Andrew Griffiths had an ounce of decency left in his body he would quit as an MP now.

Republicans were filmed backing a spoof programme to teach pre-schoolers how to defend themselves with firearms as part of Sacha Baron Cohen \u0027s new show.   The British comedian\u0027s new seven-episode series, \u0027Who is America?\u0027, sees him adopt four different personas as he satirises the political and cultural life of the US in the Donald Trump era.  In the first episode, which airs tonight in the UK, the Ali G star poses as an Israeli anti-terror expert to gets two US congressmen to support for his fake \u0027Kinders\u0027 scheme for kids as young as three.  The scheme includes a fake instructional video featuring children\u0027s songs and \u0027gunimals\u0027 - weapons adorned with soft toys - that would purportedly help kids confront the school shootings that have plagued America for the past decade.  Republican congressmen Dana Rohrabacher of California and Joe Wilson of South Carolina, along with former Senate Republican leader Trent Lott, who is now a lobbyist at a Washington law firm, are shown enthusiastically backing the idea, alongside gun rights advocates and a former congressman-turned-talk radio host, Joe Walsh.  Showtime and Sacha Baron Cohen both declined to comment on the series. Those shown endorsing the fake scheme, including the politicians, had not seen the finished show ahead of its premiere in the US on Sunday. Rohrabacher, Wilson and Lott did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Walsh told CNN on Saturday that he was tricked into reading the words off a teleprompter.  The show marks Baron Cohen\u0027s first television project in a decade after he launched his comedy career as subversive white English rapper Ali G, whose interviewees included Donald Trump and Newt Gingrich. His 2006 faux documentary film \u0027Borat\u0027 ridiculed Kazakhstan and Middle Americans.  In \u0027Who is America?\u0027, Baron Cohen also takes aim at the media and political correctness, with the comedian posing as a pony-tailed liberal radio reporter on a post-2016 election cycling tour, and a man in a disability scooter who purports to investigate fake news. In the first episode, Baron Cohen\u0027s radio journalist persona is shown dining at the home of two Trump supporters in South Carolina and regaling them with lurid stories about his supposed family.

The married dad quit as a minister after it emerged he sent barmaid Imogen Treharne and a pal over 2,000 desperate messages crudely detailing violent sex acts and pleading for explicit images. But yesterday the MP for Burton and Uttoxeter in Staffordshire sent a second grovelling apology to constituents as he begged: “Judge me on my actions and achievements during eight years as MP rather than a few moments of stupidity.” Disgusted Imogen, 28, said: “He’s resigned as a minister, but not as an MP. Why? “He’s accepted what he did was wrong, so why is he still clinging on?”  She added: “The only people he hasn’t apologised to is us. Where’s our apology? “It just confirms that he still just sees us as pieces of meat. He’s just saying sorry to the people affecting his future – not the people he’s actually been affecting.” Paul Walker, chairman of the Burton and Uttoxeter Labour party, said Griffiths had no option but to quit the seat. He said: “He’s disgraced himself, embarrassed his family and his constituents. He should be taking a long look at himself and considering whether he’s morally capable of continuing as MP.” Constituent Emily Sendell, 24, said: “He should resign as MP. His voting record shows he doesn’t support vulnerable, disadvantaged people, and now doesn’t support family values.” Our sister paper the Sunday Mirror revealed the former government whip, who previously served as Theresa May’s chief of staff, sent Imogen and her pal \u0026pound700 and offered to rent a flat to meet for sex.  Imogen says Griffiths, 47, had followed her on social media for months before contacting her on June 16 after she posted a racy video to her Snapchat followers. He sent her a message asking if she did it to get a “reaction” from him. There was then talk of a threesome with a pal of Imogen’s he had seen on social media, and over the next three weeks the trio exchanged thousands of messages detailing how Griffiths would make them his sex slaves, while he paid them cash for clothes and booze. Imogen and her pal engaged consensually out of curiosity, until his messages got increasingly vulgar. Imogen said: “He was responding to all our public posts. Watching us, almost.”  On June 24 Mr Griffiths said: “You knew I would see your post and it would wind me up. Didn’t you?... All the guys perving over you.” His darker texts included threats of violence such as: “She’s so cute. So sweet. I can’t wait to beat her”. Imogen said: “I’m not saying we got taken advantage of, but he knew that we liked older men and he knew why. “He could see it a mile off. He spotted a vulnerability. He thought I appeared like a dolly bird with no brain online... that’s what he wanted.” She told of her relief that a planned meeting with him in London never went ahead – as she says he went on to boast of harming women in violent sex sessions before they broke off contact on July 6. Imogen decided she had to tell her story “so people like this wouldn’t be in power”.  She added: “People are telling me he’s a horrible scumbag. A lot of women have been sending me messages saying it’s long overdue. “There’s no chance that we’re the only girls who’ve been involved in something like this. This isn’t the first time, and it won’t be the last. It always seems to be politicians.” Griffiths, who has three-month-old daughter Alice with wife Kate, 47, said in a statement yesterday: “I would like to apologise to everyone in Burton and Uttoxeter for my actions over a two-week period. “The messages were written during a period of great personal pressure and in no way represent my views or actions. “My behaviour fell well below the standards expected of me. “I hope that people will judge me on my actions and achievements during eight years as MP for Burton and Uttoxeter rather than a few moments of stupidity. “My priority now is my family, and rebuilding their trust. I am undertaking professional treatment to ensure I never make the same mistake again. No casework will slip and everything will be dealt with fully while I am seeking help.”  In an earlier statement as he quit as small business minister he said he was “deeply ashamed” of the embarrassment he caused to the Government. Local Labour campaigner Sue Greenwood said she interviewed him in 2015 about politicians’ use of social media in elections. She claimed he told her of an “epiphany” during a visit from Jim Messina, campaign manager for then-US President Barack Obama. He told her Mr Messina had asked: “What’s the first thing you think about in the morning and the last thing at night?” He added: “I said the answer was sex but it was my smartphone! It’s the first thing I reach for in the morning and before I go to bed.” Mrs Greenwood thought nothing of it until Imogen said he flooded her with messages “as soon as he woke up and as soon as he went to bed”. She said she also saw him in a supermarket on Father’s Day, less than 24 hours after he first contacted Imogen. She said he was “sweating in his suit and seemed excited and nervous”. She said he talked of it being his first Father’s Day as a dad and that he was buying treats. She added: “Now I wonder whether he’d actually just sent that treats message to Imogen.”  His messages of depravity June 26, 7.02pm: Ladies, I was in a meeting. I’m sorry I neglected you, but daddy can be very demanding. He’s wanting more than what’s on your insta. Don’t make daddy get the flogger out. July 4, 9.28pm: I want her to own you. I want her to tie you up and beat that gorgeous big ass while daddy watches. Imogen slut, it’s about time you treated your daddy with some respect. I’m the boss here. Are you going to hold [XXX] down for me while daddy gives her a beating? Did she properly belt you? I hope she bruised you.

But when Hawaa Ayoub turned 14, she was dragged screaming to her own marriage and raped on her wedding night by a man 16 years older than her, who she did not know. Hawaa, who is now 42, tells of how she went from being a prize student destined for Oxford or Cambridge, to being imprisoned in a primitive mountainous region of the Yemen, without electricity or running water. Fighting back tears, Hawaa recalled the 13 nightmare years she spent in her forced marriage. She told BirminghamLive : “I tried many things to get out. I tried running away. I tried everything I could. I tried convincing them. “There were days when I felt like giving up, but you have your own will. You can’t just surrender.  “I was starting to lose my mind, I was on the brink of insanity.” Hawaa was brought up in Wales and was taken on what she believed was a family holiday to the land of her parents in the Arab Peninsula state. She had three children with her husband, but her marriage was considered illegal even in Yemen, where 15 is the minimum age to wed. Luckily, the mother-of three escaped after 13 years and is now living in Wolverhampton. But she still shudders at the bitter memory of her wedding day and winces over the trauma of her wedding night. Hawaa said: “My father placed my hand on the groom’s hand, as is tradition, and I would snatch it away. When they put me in the car, my father was crying violently, which is an image that has stayed with me. He knew he was destroying my life.  “The night was traumatic, extremely traumatic. It was terrible, it was horrible. He raped me. Someone knocked on the door and told him not to be rough, but it was too late. He had raped me.” Hawaa still does not know whether parents took her to Yemen with her brothers with the intention of marriage, or were coerced by relatives into the act while there. She admitted: “I still don’t know if my father planned it. I think he was pressured. “We were very excited to go to a foreign country, it was supposed to be something pleasurable. “My father told us it was a trip, that we’d be coming back as normal.” The family travelled from the southern city of Taiz to a village nestling in a remote mountain range. Within three weeks of arriving in Yemen, Hawaa says she was given the bombshell news by her father that she was getting married.  She exclaimed: “I didn’t believe him. I was thinking ‘You are joking’. He (the groom) was in Saudi, he was the son of an uncle. “My uncle was trying to give me presents. He gave me a ring, I gave it back. “My father started beating me. He did all kinds of things to make me consent to the marriage. He even threatened to cut my throat.” Hawa remembers her groom being extremely handsome but she was scared and angry about the upcoming nuptials as she was only a child. She said: He wanted love and sex, but he did not want responsibility. “He did not understand I was a child, I wanted a divorce, I wanted an education. I was held captive in a place I could not leave.”  When her captors refused to take her gravely ill second child to hospital, she doused the family\u0027s stock of grain, rice and sugar with kerosene in order to be listened to. But her victory made her husband realise he needed more control over his wife and moved her to Saudi illegally under the pretence of taking part in a pilgramage. She soon found British consulate though, openly admitted she was residing in the country without necessary papers and orchestrated her own extradition back to Yemen. Hawaa was removed, together with her children, and began divorce proceedings. One judge acknowledged that Hawaa was too young to marry and was forced into the sham ceremony – but the fact that the couple had been together for 13 years “validated” the criminal act. She eventually won and came to Wolverhampton in 2011 but it is victory that has come at a high cost.

Highways England said its plans were aimed at reducing drivers’ frustrations with roadworks. Varying speed limits could also be used within a set of roadworks, meaning higher speeds when vehicles are further away from road workers. Speed limits of 50mph are common when narrow lanes are installed during roadworks.

The day at Funland Tropicana in Weston-super-Mare in Somerset was billed as “a day of everything dinosaur related with lots to see and do”. But parents said their children were left in tears when they turned up to find just one small T-rex. The park apologised saying that part of their dinosaur exhibition were unable to attend due to last-minute transport issues. But it admitted their advertising might have “bigged-up” the event too much. They said guests who complained in at the park were offered free rides. Parents bombarded the event’s Facebook page with angry messages.  Several said their young children had been bitterly disappointed at the lack of dinosaurs and left the park in tears. Mum Charlene Harris wrote: “Dinosaur day would suggest more than just one small dinosaur! Very disappointed.” Richard Pead commented: “Very poor. One dinosaur. Just a ploy to get you to Funland and waste money on tokens. Nothing dinosaur day about it. Don’t waste your time visiting.” Charlie Rayner said: “Wow! What an absolute waste of time, disgusted that no one could even be bothered to tell the public that there is only one dinosaur. “So many disappointed children with dino t-shirts on. Brought my dino-mad 5-year-old as a well done for his school report but you left him in tears he was so upset! I’ll never be back to the Tropicana again!” Wendie Smith from Bristol said she had made the 50-mile round trip with her two grandsons, aged 3 and 7, to Funland Tropicana for Dinosaur Day.  “They were so excited, we had a sleepover and then went to see the dinosaurs,” she said. “When I got there and there was just one, I thought we were too early and they hadn’t set the rest up yet. “I’m quite cynical and I said to my partner, ‘I bet there’s just one, to get us here’.” But Wendie said that when she found out there really would be no more dinosaurs she had to break the news to her grandsons who were “gutted”. “The eldest one was absolutely gutted. I think it’s disgusting, I won’t be going back,” she said. A member of park management said it was just an unfortunate accident, not a ploy, and they were sorry visitors had been let down. They said: “It was an absolute disaster, from our point of view. We really don’t like disappointing people. “We had three dinosaurs booked. One, which was local to us, turned up but the others were coming down the M5 when the van pulling their trailer broke down.” He said the van had to be recovered meaning the dinosaurs couldn’t be delivered.

The CCTV clip shows a car slowly passing the veteran Republican\u0027s driveway on Friday night.  As it drives down the road, something seems to be thrown from the vehicle and sparks can be seen flying around a car parked in the driveway. Smoke then billows into the air amid further sparks at the west Belfast property. The attack took place at around 9.30pm on Friday, around the same a time the home of prominent republican Bobby Storey was also targeted.  No-one was hurt in either of the incidents, which followed a week of disorder in Londonderry. Officers from the Police Service of Northern Ireland said they seized remnants of large industrial, firework-type devices, capable of causing serious damage or injury at the two homes. Significant damage was also visible to a vehicle on Mr Adams\u0027 driveway in the aftermath of the attack.

The 79-year-old left Belmarsh prison in London last week after just over three years behind bars. The leader of the criminal gang - dubbed the Diamond Wheezers - was jailed for six years and three months for his role in the brazen jewellery raid. Reader, who has suffered prostate cancer and a series of strokes, was pictured enjoying the sun with friends and family at his home in Dartford.  His release sparked anger that he was not made to serve longer in jail due to the theft of millions of valuables worth up to \u0026pound29 million - including gold, diamonds and sapphires. Reader had faced a further seven-year term if he could not pay a \u0026pound6.5million confiscation ord\u0026shyer handed to him and other ringleaders, John Kenny Collins, Daniel Jones, and Terry Perkins.  The pay-back time limit expires at the end of this month.

Nine people were convicted and jailed for their roles in the raid, one of the biggest in UK history. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said the department is unable to comment on individual cases.  Earlier this year, raider Perkins died behind bars - just days after being ordered to repay \u0026pound6.5million. Perkins, who suffered from diabetes and heart problems, was part way through a seven-year sentence at HMP Belmarsh when he died.

Drinkers are said to camp out at the crack of dawn on the green in Whitleigh and spend their day guzzling super-strength lager and spirits in the sun. People living there say children have to watch grown men, some high on drugs, sit and swig vodka from lemonade bottles most days without a care in the world. There are fears this is putting families off wanting to bring their children along to Whitleigh\u0027s community-driven shops. David Griffiths, who owns Porkies Cafe, is determined to make everybody feel a sense of pride for where they live.   He told PlymouthLive : Unfortunately, it\u0027s stopping people from coming here.

I was glad there weren\u0027t any children around. Nichola Grimshaw, 23, said she adores the Whitleigh crowd. I love coming up here, to stop and yap I go in the cafe and pop in the shops. You get some good ones (street drinkers) like Glyn - he keeps himself to himself. He has a can or two and sits on the steps. If you\u0027re disabled, he helps you out, if you want your shopping bags carried he\u0027ll do that.

He says he manages to plough through eight cans a day relaxing in front of shoppers and passers-by. He said: I drink here out of boredom. It\u0027s better than watching Jeremy Kyle on TV all day.

And their case could prove to have very interesting results for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s future children. The women are challenging centuries-old laws which stop firstborn daughters from receiving hereditary peerages. This means, that if successful, a female born to Harry and Meghan could inherit the Duchess of Sussex title. Previously, it has always been the case that only a firstborn son would inherit the dukedom, regardless of whether or not he had older sisters.  Meaning that if a noble couple had only daughters, their title would die out.  This rule also applies to the Duke of York , who has only had daughters - thus his eldest, Princess Beatrice , is not currently permitted to inherit his title.   In 2013, the Establishment amended royal laws of succession to the throne before the birth of Prince George , to allow equal rights to a baby girl.   This has seen Princess Charlotte make history by becoming the first British princess to remain in a higher position in the line of succession than her newborn brother Prince Louis .   However the same rights have not been applied to peerage.  Such an obvious lack of equality between the sexes must be particularly frustrating for Meghan Markle , who upon marrying into the royal family publicly said she was: proud to be a woman and a feminist.  Hereditary peers have 92 reserved seats in the House of Lords and are able to stand for election to the house.

Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are among the royals that also feature in the set of pictures. The family appears in awe of the new prince, in particular little Charlotte who in one snap is turning away from the camera with her eyes fixed on her younger brother as she holds his hand.  She sticks close to her mum Kate in the photos and appears to be a natural poser. Meanwhile George is sat next to or on his dad William\u0027s knee - perhaps to make him sit still as he appears to have trouble sitting still and looking straight at the camera. Louis\u0027s big day was the first time the Cambridges were seen together as a family of five. Little Louis, who is just 12-weeks-old, was dressed in a cream, frilly lace royal christening gown - a replica of the intricate robe made for Queen Victoria’s eldest daughter in 1841. Four official images were taken by British photographer Matt Holyoak at Clarence House after Louis was baptised in The Chapel Royal at St James\u0027s Palace last Monday. Kate, dressed in a cream outfit by Alexander McQueen, looks a picture of elegance as she cradles her third chilld. The Duchess, who opted for a white floral headpiece designed by Jane Taylor on the special day, appears smitten.  In one photo, Kate and William are joined by their children, along with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, and the Middleton family including Kate\u0027s sister Pippa Matthews and her husband James. Members of the royal family appear in another photo without the Middletons, a third photo features the Cambridge five and the fourth photo is an image of just Kate and Louis. The photographs were taken in the morning room and garden at Clarence House. Princess Charlotte appears to love posing in the pictures, with a big adorable smile. In the shot of the extended family, she is even holding her knee in a cute pose showing her confidence. She is wearing a blue and white dress with a bow headband to match, while George is smartly dressed in pair of shorts and white polo tshirt. George gives the photographer a cheeky smile in the photo where he is sat on his dad\u0027s knee, but in the others his expression appears more shy and reserved.  Mr Holyoak, who took the pictures, said: I was truly honoured at being asked to take the official photographs at the christening of Prince Louis, and to witness at first hand such a happy event. Everyone was so relaxed and in such good spirits, it was an absolute pleasure. I only hope I have captured some of that joy in my photographs. Louis was sound asleep as he was carried into the Chapel Royal by Kate for the christening ceremony which lasted 40 minutes. After the ceremony, the baby prince looked content and wiggled his fingers as Kate gazed down and beamed at him as she held him in her arms. His proud parents celebrated after the service by cutting a tier of their wedding cake.  The Archbishop of Canterbury presided over the christening supported by The Dean of The Chapel Royal, The Right Reverend and Right Honourable the Lord Chartres, and The Sub-Dean of The Chapel Royal, The Reverend Canon Paul Wright. The music and religious readings chosen by the royal couple included This Is The Day Which The Lord Hath made by John Rutter which was composed for their wedding in 2011. After much speculation over who William and Kate would give the honour to, they chose three godfathers and three godmothers, all of whom are friends or family. Louis’s godfathers are Nicholas van Cutsem, one of four brothers who have been close to William and Harry since they were very young William’s childhood friend Guy Pelly and Harry Aubrey-Fletcher, who was one of William’s close friends from both prep school and Eton College.

Tolkien \u0027s Lord Of The Rings.  Around 30 caravans have set up camp on land at Sarehole Mill in Birmingham. Tolkien lived within 300 yards of the mill at the turn of the 20th century, between the ages four and eight. He then went on to use it as the basis for a location in The Lord of the Rings - the Mill at Hobbiton. The grounds nearby host the annual Tolkien Weekend event that celebrates the life and works of Tolkien.  But now cars, vans and caravans, many with Irish number plates, are sprawled over about three acres of the site, blotting out the silhouette of the 18th century mill. A local 38-year-old woman, who did not want to be named said: It\u0027s not only the fact they camp on this beautiful parkland, it\u0027s the fact they leave such a mess when they leave. Birmingham City Council need to do something about this it getting out of hand, they are now coming in vast numbers, I\u0027ve never known anything like it.  Alan Hart, said: The last time they came the left a hell of a mess, there is just too many of them, they\u0027re making life a misery for us. Matthew Hudson, said: It\u0027s getting too much, the council needs to step in and do something about this, they\u0027ll leave a hell of a mess when they go. The mill is a well known tourist destination run by Birmingham City Council and has a number of famous literary connections, most notably J.R.R Tolkien author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit.

The weather myth states that if it rains on July 15, wet weather will persist for 40 days and 40 nights. England and Wales are set for a dry sunny St Swithin\u0027s Day with temperatures soaring to as high as 32C (89.6F), while heavy rain will fall in parts of Scotland and much of Northern Ireland. But Met Officer forecaster Rachael West allayed fears as she said people who have enjoyed a dry Sunday will probably see some showers over the next week, and vice versa.    Certainly some changes in forecast over the next week, never mind the next coming 40 days. But if people want to believe in St Swithin\u0027s Day then that\u0027s up to them, she joked. St Swithin was an Anglo-Saxon bishop of Winchester, who died in AD862. When he was made a saint in 971, his body was dug up and moved to an indoor shrine in the city\u0027s cathedral. Some writers claimed this outraged the heavens, causing rain to pour on the church and continue uninterrupted for 40 days. But the Met Office said there had not been a record of 40 dry or 40 wet days following St Swithin\u0027s Day since records began in 1861.

Not only have you just been pampered, but you look fabulous - and you know it. But when it comes to manicure trends of late, we\u0027ve certainly had some weird ones and they just weren\u0027t worth it. From miniature combs you could brush your hair with, to nails that looked like teeth. It seems people will quite literally put anything on their finger nails. But finally there\u0027s a new trend that we\u0027re a little more willing to get on board with.  And it looks set to be a big beauty hit this summer. We\u0027re talking of course about jelly nails. The bright, eye-catching look has become a big hit on Instagram, with many people opting to try the style in neon hues. Similar to the jelly shoes and jelly backpacks that were popular with youngsters in the 1990s, the jelly nails are slightly transparent.  They\u0027re also known as \u0027glass nails\u0027 because of the transparency. The jelly nails are being done in all shapes and sizes, with some going all out to have long pointed claws and others opting for a more sleek, square look. To get the look for yourself simply ask your nail technician to add a clear tip to your nails or use clear gel to sculpt the extension. But be warned that not every salon may stock the right tools or gels needed to recreate the cool manicure.  Some people have also been adding stickers and glitter to their jelly manicures to create interesting effects. People on social media are big fans of the look, with more than 3,500 posts cropping up under the jelly nails hashtag. One user said: Wow these are so cool!

There are so many names out there and you\u0027ve got to get it right. You have to like it, they have to live with it. The pressure is really on for parents. One mum thought she had picked the perfect name for her daughter, and for four years this was the case. However as the youngster prepares to start school in September, her mother faces a bizarre dilemma. She revealed all in an online forum, and people were more than a little outraged by her words.  The mum, who goes by the username Chesternut, said: My daughter is four years old and I gave her a name which I thought was very original as I hadn\u0027t heard another girl called it in about 20 years. Only to find when she started nursery another girl called the same but spelt differently. Daughter is due to start full-time education in September and there will be two other girls with the same name, so three in the class including her. She added that she was totally hacked off and upset by this.   The post on Mumsnet continued to explain: Maybe an over reaction but in the 1970s I was one of five named the same in my class and vowed never to have my children live with the same. Now history is being repeated.  Am I being unreasonable to change my daughter\u0027s name before September? I love her name but HATE it\u0027s so common now. She later revealed the daughter\u0027s name is Esm\u0026eacutee. Daughter\u0027s name is Esm\u0026eacutee and I\u0027ve lived through this. I can remember my whole junior/secondary school time being coloured by the fact that so many of us had the same name. I changed it as soon as I could because of that reason. Every time I hear my real name I shudder.

Conspiracy theories that the rap icon is secretly alive and in hiding have persisted ever since he was shot dead in 1996. And now a man calling himself Noah and claiming to be visiting from the future, has claimed the musician did not die. Instead, he says Tupac\u0027s disappearance is all because of the Illuminati - a secret organisation some people believe controls the world.  Noah came up with the bizarre theory during an interview for paranormal YouTube channel ApexTV.   Asked if he knew whether any celebrities had faked their own death, the self-described time traveller singled out the Death Row Records star. He told the channel: When I was in the future I was trying to get as much information as possible from anybody. I was able to figure out that Tupac isn\u0027t dead but he was in a critical state for about a year after his \u0027death\u0027. And Noah said the hip-hop legend\u0027s death was staged because he had discovered secrets about the Illuminati.  Noah said: The reason why all this happened is because his friends that were rapping were involved in the Illuminati. They tried getting Tupac in there but he found it terrible. He didn’t tell them if he was going to say anything about it or not but they take things to the extreme. They are able to shoot him and say he’s dead. Their goal was to keep him away from the public.” However, Noah also claimed the lluminati as we think of it does not exist, but there is a very similar group. He said: I’ve had a big experience with the Illuminati.

However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding.

Full timetables for services are available on The Open and ScotRail websites.Meanwhile, Stagecoach – which already runs services through Carnoustie from Dundee and other parts of Angus – will be running additional services at peak times, with demand expected to be high.There will also be a designated bicycle park near the course, accessed via National Cycle Route 1 and by following the signs on approach to Carnoustie Golf Links.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b487e1ac8223-834x564.jpg ","title":"new boy callum booth likes the way new look dundee united are gelling","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt will be a new-look Dundee United team that even most of their own fans won’t recognise when the Betfred Cup kicks off with a group-stage tie against Arbroath at Tannadice today.The Tangerines could field eight of their nine new summer signings and, so far, the only chance Arabs have had to see them in action was in the friendly victory up at Brechin City early last week.United impressed that night but the two build-up games since against Raith Rovers and then Cowdenbeath took place in private at their St Andrews training base.One of the new boys who’ll be on show, Callum Booth, reports the encouraging signs of the Brechin run out continued in those two closed-door affairs.And while he’s conscious the best time to judge any team is when the competitive action starts, he’s not been surprised by the fact things seem to be coming together at pace.“I think it’s a case of if you sign good players they will click quickly. That’s what we’ve done and I’ve been impressed by the boys in training and these friendlies,” said the 27-year-old full-back.“Quite a few of the boys who’ve been brought in also have good experience of Scottish football. They know what to expect and have fitted in.“On top of that we’ve done a lot of hard work in the three-and-a-bit weeks since pre-season training. As usual there’s been a lot of fitness stuff and I’m experienced enough to know you need to put that work in to make sure you’re not hit by injuries and niggles during a season.“But we’ve also done a lot of tactical stuff.“The manager (Csaba Laszlo) is very big on that side of things and the training has been good.“As good as it’s looked, we know the real test comes with the competitive stuff and we’re looking forward to that starting against Arbroath.“It will be a good test. I know a few of the boys there and they had a very good season last year, so they’ll be looking forward to coming to Tannadice and trying to get a good start to their season.”This will also be former Hibs and Partick Thistle man Booth’s first home game as a United player and he admits the chance to turn out at Tannadice on a regular basis was a factor in his decision to sign up on a two-year deal last month.“I’ve played there a few times down the years and it’s a great stadium,” he added.“Add that to the training facility over in St Andrews, which is brilliant, and it was definitely one of the reasons I was delighted to join United.”When he decided to end his three-year stint with Patrick at the end of last term, it was widely expected Booth would stay in the Premiership. Several top-flight clubs were credited with a strong interest and it was something of a surprise when he opted for the Dundee United option.He admits stepping down to the Championship with United was something he had to think long and hard about.Ultimately, he believes while in terms of division he’s taking a temporary step down, in the longer term it’s going to prove to be a case of onwards and upwards.“It was a big decision but once I thought it through I knew it was the right one.“I’ve got a bit of experience now but at 27 I, hopefully, still have a few years left and I should be coming into my prime.“When I look at the potential at this club, I know where it can go and, hopefully, I will be back playing in the Premiership before too long.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/SNS-15161464-Dundee-UTD-Photocall.jpg-904x564.jpg ","title":"non stop ringing in luggys ears as players come calling for dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRebuilding the squad at Dundee United has made for a hectic summer – just a glance at the list of calls received on Paul Sturrock’s phone tells you that.The Tangerines legend and current chief scout has revealed over the past couple of months there have been days he’s taken over 100 calls from agents of players on the club’s list of possible signing targets.But he’s hoping the next 10 months will show the hard graft he, manager Csaba Laszlo and the other members of the back-room staff have put in has been worth it.To date, those calls have resulted in nine new signings and as many as four more are still planned.After missing out on promotion back to the Premiership for the past two years, the feeling was those kind of numbers were necessary to make sure United get it right this time.And “Luggy” believes, starting with today’s Betfred Cup kick-off against Arbroath, the fans will see they’ve at last got a team capable of doing the required job.“It has been a very busy summer for the manager, myself and a few others. There have been days when the phone’s rang over a 100 times but that’s what happens when you make the slight changes we’ve made,” he joked.“It really started right after we lost to Livingston in the play-offs and we’ve been going ever since.“I know the manager is happy with the nine players he’s got so far and there are a few more we’d like and don’t forget the back-room staff have also been reshuffled.”And it’s not just been about identifying talent – making sure players have the right character and are capable of handling the rigours of the second tier has been important, too.“In a lot of ways it’s not finding players with talent that’s the hard part, it’s making sure they are the right type, so there’s been a lot of work checking on backgrounds and how they are away from the pitch.“And when you look to last season, St Mirren and Livingston were successful using two different styles but what they had in common was they were physically strong.“I think at times we were lacking that so we have made sure we’ve got players who can play but also handle the other side of it as well.”Or so he believes, and Luggy accepts proof United have got it right this time will only come via the results.“The proof of the pudding starts with Arbroath. It’s been a very good pre-season and everyone has enjoyed it but now we have to take the hard work on to the park.“Arbroath is a good game to start because I know Dick and Ian Campbell very well and they will come to Tannadice looking for a result.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"randy wolters leaves dundee to join nec on two year deal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWinger Randy Wolters has left Dundee to join Dutch side NEC.The 28-year-old still had another year on his deal at Dens Park but the two parties have come to a mutual agreement meaning Wolters could leave for pastures new.He has now penned a two-year deal with Dutch second tier side NEC (Nijmegen Eendracht Combinatie).Wolters previously told of his struggles with homesickness having played all of his career in the Netherlands before joining Dundee last summer.He made 16 appearances for the Dark Blues.Before the move in a press conference today, McCann said: “Randy moving on is a possibility.\u0026#8220He’s very frustrated he didn’t feature more.

An employment tribunal awarded him more than £10,000.But now Mr Brown, who runs events and production company The Longest Forty, is taking the club and American director Mr Nelms to a tribunal again – this time citing post-employment victimisation and harassment.The action stems from a dispute over a Legends of the Ball – Champions 2013/2014 event which was due to take place at the Doubletree by Hilton on the outskirts of the city in February.It is understood that Mr Brown alleges that Dens Park chief Mr Nelms contacted Hilton boss Richard Ellison and forced him to cancel the event – leading to a breach of contract – and said he was unhappy someone who was successful in a claim against the club was working alongside the hotel.He also alleges Mr Nelms prevented current Dundee players Craig Wighton and Cammy Kerr from attending the event, despite them having already agreed to do so and having been advertised as appearing.The event was cancelled and Mr Brown alleges this was due to his previous case against Dundee.He now wants damages and alleges that Mr Nelms’ actions were maliciously motivated.It is understood both the club amd Mr Nelms dispute Mr Brown’s claims and insist he did not intervene and that official permission was never sought for players to attend the event.Dundee FC and representatives for Mr Nelms declined to comment.Solicitor Ryan Russell, of Muir Myles and Laverty, confirmed he had been instructed to pursue a claim on Mr Brown’s behalf.He said: “Due to the ongoing legal proceedings, it would inappropriate to comment at this stage on the specifics or merits of the claim.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Monday 16 Jul 2018 4:34 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116630.jpg","title":"Schoolgirls inspiring bid to wipe out racism","story":"\u0026nbspA DETERMINED eight-year-old has been praised after taking an inspirational stand against racism in her community by personally removing a vile message she found defacing a local mural.Breagha Gowans spotted the anti-Muslim slur scribbled on the wall of an underpass near Culloden Wood while out for a walk with her mother Michelle.After the pair had a chat about what exactly the message \u0026ndash which the Courier will not print \u0026ndash meant, the youngster decided to step up and take it upon herself to erase it, gathering a bag full of cleaning equipment for the job.\"I wanted to clean up the graffiti because I have a friend at school who is Muslim and I didn\u0026rsquot want her to be upset,\" she said.\"I wanted to be kind towards others.\"The underpass where Breagha spotted the graffiti passes below Barn Church Road and is covered in a colourful mural in a deliberate bid to dissuade would-be vandals from defacing the walls.After scrubbing the wall clean again, she appealed to everyone to show more respect towards those around them.\"Please don\u0026rsquot do it because it is hateful and no-one likes bullies,\" she said.\"It isn\u0026rsquot good to hurt people\u0027 feelings and I didn\u0026rsquot like to see something that would make someone feel bad.\"Breagha\u0027 father is Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans who said he was proud of the way she had decided to tackle the problem head-on.\"I told her it was fantastic \u0026ndash though like a typical eight-year-old she was off doing something else,\" he said.\"Breagha and her class have been learning about different religions at Inshes Primary School and she has a very strong sense of justice and fairness.\"It is a testament to what they are teaching in school.

A friendly at Inverness Caley Thistle on Wednesday had to be called off due to injury problems.Summer signing Stephen Gleeson (knee), Niall McGinn (thigh), Mikey Devlin (groin) and Frank Ross (groin) are injured.The Reds are still awaiting the full results of a scan which will reveal the extent of Gleeson’s injury.He will miss tomorrow’s friendly with Cove Rangers, but the Dons are still hopeful he could feature against Burnley in the Europa League second qualifying round, the first leg of which is on July 26.Another summer signing, Chris Forrester (groin), and Sam Cosgrove (calf) were also injured but are expected to be fit to face Cove tomorrow.So far this summer the Dons have only signed three players with £200,000 outlaid for the capture of Forrester from Peterborough United.Republic of Ireland international Gleeson was secured on a free. An SPFL tribunal will decide the training compensation due for teenager Lewis Ferguson who signed from Hamilton.Polish defender Krystian Nowak is currently training with the Dons and is set to feature as a trialist in tomorrow’s friendly.The 24-year-old is a free agent having had his contract with Greek side Panionios terminated earlier this summer.Aberdeen also had a bid for Doncaster striker John Marquis, understood to be for £250,000, rejected.Boss Derek McInnes confirmed that bid was the highest the Reds could go to and they will now look at other potential targets for centre-forward.Celtic and Rangers have both invested heavily in their squads this season.But Considine insists the heavy spending of the Old Firm will only inspire Aberdeen.He said: “Celtic always generate so much money through their transfers and whatever.“You expect it from them.“Due to the situation with Rangers they haven’t been able to do that, but this year they have. It is great to see and is healthy for Scottish football.“A strong Rangers is good for the league.“It also brings us on.“In the past few years or so we have still remained second so regardless of what they are going to spend we are still going to challenge this season again.”Aberdeen’s preparations for the Euro tie with Burnley conclude with a friendly against West Brom at Pittodrie on Friday.The Baggies were relegated to the Championship at the end of last season.Considine said: ”When we play West Brom here that will be a good indication of what is coming.“Although they were obviously relegated, in my eyes they are still a Premier League team.“That will be a good test for us and will show where we are at and what is coming opposition wise.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/2411204-423x564.jpg ","title":"four north east homes available to rent from 475 a month1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEvery week we feature a selection of our favourite properties available to rent in the north-east.Today we’ve picked these four properties are all available from £475 per month.Available for lease on a fully furnished basis, this one-bedroom flat is set in a popular residential area of Rosemount, which is close to all local amenities.The property has a fully equipped dining kitchen, well-proportioned lounge with a comfortable sofa and feature fireplace, double bedroom with a large wardrobe and a modern shower room.The flat benefits from gas central heating, double glazing, access to landing cupboard, exclusive outhouse as well as a communal garden.A parking permit is available upon request from the local authority.Viewing: Ledingham Chalmers LLP on 01224 408405This modern two-bedroom end terrace property is available for lease on a fully furnished basis.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful.

I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The biggest cheer of the day was reserved for this year’s Queen Chloe Macdonald, who together with her Princesses Caitlyn Prentice and Cara Mackie were introduced to the crowd by Rev Robert Macleod and Councillor Anne Horn.Tarbert’s new Royal Family then led the famous festival parade where locals and visitors alike dressed up and joined in with this year’s Heroes and Villains theme.  Pirates and superheroes watched on as Cruella De Vil and her dogcatcher tried to capture more Dalmatian puppies. And the Batmobile was hot on the trail of the Joker who was seen heading through the village with Poison Ivy.One of the festival’s most eagerly anticipated events is the cookery demonstrations, once again led by Mike Leslie of Kilsyth’s Coachman Hotel. The market area was packed as cooks got some professional tips on how to prepare and cook seafood.While the adults tucked into some of Tarbert’s finest fish and shellfish, younger festival-goers were being wowed by the gravity defying Clan Stunt Bike Team, before learning new skills in the circus workshop.Highland dancing displays plus performances by festival regulars Mid Argyll Pipe Band ensured there was something for everyone, before Sunday’s Beer on the Pier, where party people of all ages packed Tarbert’s quay, ready to be entertained.Girl band Feeva promised and delivered ‘cheesy tunes’ and were closely followed by Scotland’s number one Take That cover band, Could It Be Take That, to keep the party atmosphere going. Local band The Democrats brought the curtain down on this year’s festival in style.With just three people in the festival committee it fell to organiser Margaret MacNeill to comment on this year’s event saying: \u0026#8216Thank you to everyone who came and joined in with this year\u0026#8217s Seafood Festival.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole. Councillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy. Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government. A total of 87 written responses were received during the council’s consultation that officials noted was “low considering the size of Maybole with a population of 4,700 people”.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit. It follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies. The game was then followed by a raffle. The three clubs had to choose a charity to donate funds to, with Royal Troon deciding to donate to Ward 3E. Andrew Power, club captain of Royal Troon, said: “We chose to donate to the Acute Stroke Unit as three of our members were in this unit over the last year and are all now recovering well. The word from them is that they got the best of care and were delighted we chose to donate to the unit” During the event, Stroke and TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) information packs were handed out, making it a great opportunity to spread awareness of how to act when someone is suffering from a stroke.  Andrew added: “We had a great day, great weather and we were glad we made a good amount for a good cause. We’d like to say from all at Royal Troon that you (staff at Ward 3E) do a great job and hope this cheque can help out in any way it can”. Senior charge nurse, Christine Sommerville, said: “Patients are admitted from all over Ayrshire to the ASU. Stroke happens with no warning, but with specialised care and input, outcomes are improved. “We are delighted to hear the members are recovering well and that they had a positive experience in the ASU. “On behalf of the ASU team, a big thank you.

He also took a pack of yum-yums recently. “He is like a thief in the night. He stalks this place.

It landed outside Greggs, walked straight to the crisps stand inside, got a pack of ready salted and headed back out to the pavement. “ It then whacked the packet with its beak and devoured them. It only stopped to let out a cry of joy in the middle of its feast. “A few other people saw it and were incredulous.

That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-spca-report-80-per-cent-increase-in-calls-about-dogs-in-hot-cars","story":"THE Scottish SPCA are urging Borders residents to ensure their pets stay safe during the warm weather.\nScotland\u0026rsquos animal welfare charity has seen an 80 per cent increase in calls to their animal helpline from members of the public concerned about dogs in hot cars. within the last few weeks.\nScottish SPCA chief superintendent Mike Flynn said: \"We\u0027re very concerned at the number of reports we\u0027re receiving about dogs being left inside cars during the hot weather.\n\"Owners need to understand that it\u0027s completely unacceptable to leave a dog in a vehicle in these searing temperatures, even for a short period of time with the windows down.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

higher speeds through motorway roadworks depending on the day of the week.\nSpeed limits could be increased from 50mph to 60mph when there is less activity by road workers, Highways England announced.\nThis could see limits increased on Sundays compared with other days.\nHighways England, the Government-owned company responsible for managing England\u0026rsquos motorways and A roads, said its plans were aimed at reducing drivers\u0026rsquo frustrations with roadworks.\nVarying speed limits could also be used within one set of roadworks, meaning higher speeds are allowed when vehicles are further away from road workers.\nSpeed limits of 50mph are common when narrow lanes are installed on motorways during roadworks.\nTests will be carried out to see if varying speed limits could be introduced without increasing risks for motorists or staff.\nHighways England figures show there are nearly 300 incidents a week of drivers entering coned-off areas or subjecting road workers to physical or verbal abuse on motorways of major A roads.\nThe company\u0026rsquos chief executive Jim O\u0026rsquoSullivan said: \u0026ldquoPeople understand roadworks are necessary but are also frustrated by them.\n\u0026ldquoAt the same time we have to ensure as they drive through them that they, and our road workers, are safe.\n\u0026ldquoSo we are always thinking of new ways to improve journeys at the same time as keeping everyone as safe as we can.\n\u0026ldquoThat is why over the next 12 months we will test changes to the design and operation of

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.

ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.

Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.  Twenty-year-old Emily\u0026rsquos involvement in the project is the latest step as she attempts to land her dream job.

A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.  That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.  Mr Bruce said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoShe has done really well and she is an excellent drummer.  \u0026ldquoShe is onto the development band and that will open up lots of opportunities for her in the future.  The achievement was highlighted by school interim headteacher, Lauren Rodger, in her newsletter.  She added: \u0026ldquoAnyone seeing Clara perform here at Knox will know that she is a natural percussionist and we\u0026rsquore delighted for her."},{"url":null,"title":"kit-fraser-republishes-his-dads-story-of-time-with-macbrayne","story":"  Chris Fraser\u0026rsquos autobiography Christie Boy: A MacBrayne\u0026rsquos Man was released in 1994.  Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.  As well as his time with MacBrayne, the book looks at Kit\u0026rsquos dad\u0026rsquos time in the Armed Forces, as well as becoming a sub-postmaster in Aviemore as the town evolved from a \u0026ldquosleepy former railway junction into its present skiing and outdoor pursuits centre.  Kit, 66, who previously worked as a BBC correspondent, told the Courier he had \u0026ldquohalf an idea for another book but was still considering whether to put pen to paper once again.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day. The classical music enthusiast and trumpeter has also worked on a documentary about Felix Mendelssohn and is currently working on one on Fryderyk Chopin.  Now, following his graduation, he can\u0026rsquot wait to get his documentary career under way in earnest.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhilst studying I have been coached and trained by lecturers who are well-known in the industry and it has been wonderful to benefit from their experience.  \u0026ldquoI am now in the process of sitting down with production companies, and looking forward to establishing my own name as a documentary maker.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos also proved to be lucky for me because I have been enjoying a lucky streak recently.  \u0026ldquoI won $4million (\u0026pound3.4m) back in November and another million dollars last month as well. So I have no intention of leaving.  Dominik may well love life in the Scottish capital, but shot a warning to one of the city\u0027s famous sons Sir Sean Connery, saying he would thrash James Bond at poker.

He said: \"G-APRS, or Primrose as she is affectionately known by those who flew her, was one of the last flying Twin Pioneers in the world.  \"She faithfully served on civilian and military missions for nearly 50 years, before being retired because of her ageing wing struts.

In a typewritten letter sent to the Sunday Post, Byrne, best known for the Slab Boys trilogy of plays, branded the Charles Rennie Mackintosh building \u0026ldquothe school that died of shame.  Byrne also insisted that even before last month\u0026rsquos devastating fire, it was \u0026ldquono longer in use as a working art school (neither students nor staff can actually draw).  Tom Inns, director of the Glasgow School of Art, last week moved to end speculation about the future of the gutted building, saying it would be rebuilt, in a painstaking process involving the dismantling of sections by hand, with the bricks logged and stored for possible reuse.  Mr Inns said: \u0026ldquoThe Mackintosh Building will be rebuilt and will be a working art school. We will rebuild so the Mack can continue to provide creative inspiration to students, staff and visitors.  However, the plan has sparked fierce debate, with critics questioning the suggested \u0026pound200 million cost and insisting the new building would only ever be a fake Mackintosh.  Some have called for a contest for young artists and architects to design a new school while supporters insist famous buildings around the world have been rebuilt successfully.  Byrne, however, said: \u0026ldquoI really don\u0026rsquot care if they rebuild it or not \u0026ndash the soul of the art school is completely gone, never to return.  Byrne, who attended the art school in the late \u0026lsquo50s, said the ethos of the school had been lost to the crass commercialism of modern art, embodied, for him, by the New York pop artist Jeff Koons who once sold a sculpture of an orange balloon dog for $58 million.  He wrote: \u0026ldquoIn 1958, when I enrolled at Glasgow School of Art, I was in no doubt whatsoever that I was going to be working in a great work of art itself and for the next five years that\u0026rsquos what I did, growing to love it even more and to recognise that it possessed, through Mackintosh\u0026rsquos genius, a Life and Soul of its own.

Officials want to use the rugged backdrop for scenes in The Long Night, set 10,000 years before the original fantasy series.  They visited Skye seek out beauty spots that would be ideal for use as action and scenery.  Earlier this month, it was announced that work on the spin-off will begin in Belfast\u0027s Titanic Quarter Film Studios in October, the same venue used to shoot many of the indoor scenes for Game Of Thrones over its eight series, while outdoor locations around Northern Ireland have also featured.  Fans of the must-see TV drama have already created online maps featuring every location used for Game of thrones, including Doune Castle which was used for the pilot episode. Scenes have been shot around the world, including in Iceland, Malta and Croatia and all countries have benefited from a rise in tourist numbers thanks to the programme\u0027s global following.  A record 2.1million overseas tourists visited Northern Ireland in 2016, upping revenue from this sector by 12 per cent, according to Tourism Ireland figures.  Belfast Airport also had the highest passenger increase of any destination, with 388,486 more customers in 2016 than the previous year.  HBO have green-lit five prequel series and commissioned a pilot episode.  A source said: \"This would be a massive development for Skye. Game Of Thrones had a huge impact on tourist numbers wherever it was filmed. The same will most likely apply to the prequel. Skye is definitely a potential venue for the The Long Night.  \"The show is set 10,000 years before Game Of Thrones so the makers need new ideas and locations. Skye ticks a lot of boxes for them.\"  Filming of the eighth and final series of Game Of Thrones finished earlier this month in Northern Ireland.  Most of the show has been filmed there since 2010.  The scenery of Skye has proved increasingly popular for movie and TV producers in recent years, with films shot there including 2008\u0027s Made of Honour, featuring Kevin McKidd and Patrick Dempsey the Alien sequel Prometheus in 2012, Macbeth with Michael Fassbender in 2015 and Roald Dahl\u0027s The BFG in 2016.  Blockbusters Transformers: The Last Knight and King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword both shot there last year.  The prequel series is being created by Game Of Thrones author George RR Martin.

Concerns have grown about the long-term impact of heading the ball since the death of England and West Bromwich Albion player Jeff Astle in 2002.  The cause of his death was a degenerative brain disease that had first become apparent as long as five years earlier.  A coroner found that the repeated minor trauma of heading the ball had been the cause of his death, as the leather footballs used in Astle\u0026rsquos playing days were considerably heavier than the plastic ones used nowadays, particularly when wet.  For the study at the University of Delaware in the United States, 20 players recruited from the community in Newark, New Jersey, took a balance test where they walked along a foam walkway with their eyes closed under two conditions \u0026ndash with galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) and without GVS.  For GVS, electrodes placed behind each ear stimulate the nerves that send messages from the balance system in the inner ear to the brain, so the stimulators can make you feel like you are moving when you are not. In this case, it made participants feel like they were falling sideways.  The footballers, who had an average age of 22, also completed questionnaires about how many times they had headed the ball during the past year. The number of headers over a year for each participant ranged from 16 to 2,100, with an average of 451 headers.  The study found that the players with the largest number of headers had the largest balance responses to GVS in both foot placement and hip movement during the walking test, which indicated they had balance recovery problems.  Study author Dr Fernando Santos, of the University of Delaware, said: \u0026ldquoSoccer players must have good balance to play the game well, yet our research suggests headers may be undermining balance, which is key to all movement, and yet another problem now linked to headers.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that additional research be done to look more closely at this possible link with balance and to confirm our findings in larger groups of people."},{"url":null,"title":"living-costs-higher-than-expected-for-undergraduates","story":"  Research by Which?

A survey of undergraduates, conducted by the website, found that two in five (40%) agreed that living costs at university are higher than they expected.

He was born in Hawaii, where he spent most of his childhood, raised by his mother, a white American from Kansas.  He barely knew his late father, for whom he was named, Barack Obama, an economist.  Large crowds are however expected in Kisumu, Kenya\u0026rsquos third largest city, where Obama will fly on Monday before driving to his father\u0026rsquos home village of Kogelo in Siaya County, a journey of about 43 miles.  Big screens will be set up in towns in Siaya County to show the launch of the vocational centre and prevent overcrowding at the venue, said Siaya County governor Cornell Rasanga on Nation Television.  \u0026ldquoWe are upbeat about the coming of the president Barack Obama, said Rasanga, who added he was not expecting much in terms of any announcements of aid.  Rasanga said he would ask Obama to help develop a university to be called President Barack Obama University."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeenshire economy buzzing with activity","story":"        A range of local business developments which demonstrate the strengths of the area\u0026#8217s economy have been welcomed by Aberdeenshire Council, as a new economic action plan for the area is introduced to reflect a more positive economic outlook.                Named as Fishing News 2017 ‘Port of the Year’ Peterhead Port handled a record £195million worth of fish during 2017. The port is currently undergoing a £51 million investment and opened the UK’s biggest fish market in June, landing a huge sale of 5,990 boxes on opening day.                                                     Nearby Fraserburgh Harbour, also an important fishing port, has been diversifying, recently being announced as the preferred port for the Moray Offshore Renewable scheme as a base for operation and maintenance of renewable projects being developed in the Moray Firth.                                                     The Council worked with the harbour to support its bid and roads and transportation teams are continuing to provide logistical support as necessary to both Fraserburgh and Peterhead ports.        Global energy firm Equinor and its partner Masdar recently unveiled their Batwind project in Peterhead, for the first time making it possible to store energy produced from an offshore wind farm.Electricity produced at the world’s first floating offshore wind farm, Hywind Scotland, located 25km off the coast of Peterhead, will be transported via cables to an onshore substation where 1 MW batteries are placed and connected to the grid. The battery capacity is the equivalent of more than 128,000 iPhones.As the wind isn’t always blowing, energy storage technologies like batteries are expected to become increasingly important to secure grid stability as renewable energy becomes ever more significant.And in agriculture, the council’s Garioch Area Committee recently approved planning permission for an expansion of Thainstone Mart, supporting an application designed to assist the local industry’s long term future.

ISC chair Peter Argyle welcomed the significant developments around the area and the signals they send out to others who may be interested in investing. He welcomed the refreshed RES Action Plan and said: “There are strong signs of significant and improving economic investment and outcomes across the region and we all have to continue to work to secure a bright future for the north east economy.                                                                                                        \"The new, revised and updated Regional Economic Strategy Action Plan for 2018-23 sets out how we can achieve that, but it is important to note recent developments in the area which show an increasingly positive business environment.\" Leader of Aberdeenshire Council, Jim Gifford, added: “The council is working with its partners in many areas to improve our local economy and it\u0027s great to see signs that businesses are feeling more confident and we are keen to support that wherever we can. \"Our focused work in the northern towns of Peterhead, Fraserburgh, Banff and Macduff is showing real signs of progress, with lots more to come, and our local communities are showing this really is a good place to do business.\"                "},{"url":null,"title":"airport workers vote for strike action over pay","story":"        Workers at Aberdeen International Airport have voted for strike action after 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.

The privately-owned firms operate two service lines from their headquarters in Huntly, comprising the development of private residential homes – mainly in Aberdeenshire – and the provision of design and build contracts for housing associations across the north of Scotland.        Five of the firms’ 14 employees have been made redundant with immediate effect, while the remaining employees have been retained to assist the administrators to realise the companies’ assets, including four sites currently being developed in Peterhead, Burntisland, Keith and Kemnay and Peterhead.Deveron Homes was established in 2002 and the construction arm was incorporated in 2008. In recent years, both businesses encountered challenges and delays on a number of development projects.The resulting additional costs, combined with difficult conditions in the sector and the wider challenges in the Aberdeenshire housing market, left the firms with reduced margins, significant levels of debt and a lack of funding to acquire new sites.Following an assessment of the immediate funding requirement, the directors determined they had no choice but to place both companies into administration to protect the creditors’ position as best as possible.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Monday 16 Jul 2018 4:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Halkirk butcher hangs up his apron for the final time","story":"IT was the end of an era in Halkirk as local butcher Hugh John MacKay hung up his shop apron for the last time.Hugh, who ran MacKay\u0026rsquos of Halkirk as well as the Lifestyle Express grocery store, decided to retire after five decades of service.However, the Bridge Street butcher\u0026rsquos shop will still be run by a MacKay as Hugh\u0026rsquos son Matthew will take overHugh was the third in line of MacKays who owned and ran the butcher\u0026rsquos shop for the Halkirk community.Hugh grandfather, John, started the enterprise with a store in Lybster before setting up the shop in Halkirk then it passed on to Hugh\u0026rsquos dad \u0026ndash who was also named Hugh \u0026ndash with his uncle Angus taking over the Lybster shop before handing it over to his son, David.As for the Halkirk shop, Hugh, now 68, was only 16 his father died, \u0026shyleaving the family to take over the running of the shop.Hugh revealed it would not have been a success without the determined work of his mother, Belle.He said: \u0026ldquoI had just turned 16 when my father passed away. I stepped in to help with the shop.\u0026ldquoIt was proposed by the bank to sell up but my mother was determined to keep the family home and business and we all rallied round to make it a success.\u0026ldquoShe would do the book-keeping while also combining that role by milking five cows twice a day and ensuring the villagers had their milk.\u0026ldquoSadly she passed away in 1978 and it was at this point that I took over the shop.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove had some fine staff working alongside me \u0026ndash including Grant MacDonald who has been with me for all this time apart from three years he spent in the late sixties and early seventies working as the butcher on board the QE2 cruise ship.\u0026ldquoAlthough he\u0026rsquos the same age as me, Grant is carrying on as a butcher to assist my son Matthew who is taking over from me.Hugh also owned a grocer\u0026rsquos shop on Sinclair Street, which he purchased in 2001.

The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care.

He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing.

I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected. One morning in Wigan I counted 691 plastic bottles just in the first hour of paddling.Cal admitted that the marathon paddle was not without a scary moment or two.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Mull of Galloway paddle was one of the more terrifying moments. Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful. When I was 12 miles across, the waves were almost as big as me and the storm came in early. I was very scared and felt very alone \u0026ndash panic was starting to set in.\u0026ldquoOnce I was within a mile of the island, and knew I was safe, fear turned to exhilaration, and the feeling of being propelled along by 20-30 knot winds was incredible.Monday 16 Jul 2018 4:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Water levels as low as 1976 on River Thurso","story":"WATER levels on the River Thurso have been at their lowest in decades during the recent dry spell, according river expert Eddie McCarthy.Mr McCarthy, who retired as river superintendent in 2016, has manned the river for 37 years and says that the dry weather of the past few weeks has resulted in water levels comparable to those in the 1976 heatwave.Levels in 1984 were similarly low.One or two anglers have travelled up for pre-booked fishing trips only to change their plans after seeing the low water.However, overall this has had minimal impact on the river angling business, according Mr McCarthy.\u0026ldquoThe anglers are usually quite hardy, he said. \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquoll take their golf clubs up or will go trout fishing.Despite the rain returning on Monday, Mr McCarthy is unsure when the water levels will return to normal. \u0026ldquoWe need 72 hours of proper rain for it to rise.

Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Monday 16 Jul 2018 4:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 15, 2018 at 9:00 amThe 70th Stromness Shopping Week kicks off, today, Sunday, with the annual hack due to take place starting at 12.30pm.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Monday 16 Jul 2018 4:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

We had quite a lot of bad weather just after we started in January, and then we had to wait for the big spring tides so we could carry out a lot of the work.\"The jetty was in fairly poor shape as it had been there for more than 100 years and had spent the entire time being battered by the sea.\"We made the jetty wider and also lengthened it.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768716.1531508333!/image/image.jpg","title":"john mclellan bojo s barmy army is polishing a t d","story":"        Scots Tory MP Ross Thomson\u0026#8217s claim that the UK is set to be \u0026#8216vassal state\u0026#8217 under Theresa May\u0026#8217s Brexit plan looks like pitch to join a future Cabinet under Boris Johnson, writes John McLellan.                The former editor of this newspaper, Magnus Linklater, must shake his head when he sees Boris Johnson bumbling purposefully onto the next publicity stunt, remembering the time when he defeated Bojo in one of the more bizarre elections Edinburgh has witnessed.            In 2006, Linklater’s 3,052 votes were enough to see off Johnson’s challenge to be rector of Edinburgh University, a bid no-one quite understood given the 41-year-old Johnson was already the high-profile MP for Henley and shadow Higher Education spokesman, and had no known connection with the university.             Instrumental in mounting Johnson’s Edinburgh challenge was my old chum Brian Monteith, the then Tory MSP who was to re-emerge at the heart of the Leave.EU PR operation. Even an inveterate plotter as Brian couldn’t have been preparing Bozza for Brexit 12 years ago, and the suspicion was it was just a profile-raiser. It worked as long as the campaign lasted, with a beer-drenching the highlight of a raucous campaign, but the PR bubble burst the minute he lost. In fact he came third, with Linklater second to the victorious Green MSP Mark Ballard.READ MORE: Donald Trump lashes out at Theresa May in extraordinary interviewIt might also have worked as a publicity stunt to attract more English public school types without enough A levels for Oxbridge or Durham, but Johnson has barely been seen in the capital since. His two terms as Mayor of London were regarded as a success, largely due to his flamboyant fronting of the London Olympics, but then came his calculating, cynical approach to the EU referendum. The twists of fate which followed the result saw his prime ministerial ambitions raised, dashed and then revived by Theresa May as her Foreign Secretary. Working out Johnson’s motivation has never been too difficult for those who know him well and selfless service has never been high on the list, but few have described his character with such elegant venom as another who resuscitated his career, former Daily  editor Max Hastings who hired him after the young reporter was sacked by The Times for fabricating stories in 1988.            “It is a common mistake to suppose Johnson a nice man,” wrote Hastings in, appropriately, The Times this week. “Johnson’s glittering intelligence is not matched by self-knowledge ... He is a man of remarkable gifts, flawed by an absence of conscience, principle or scruple. It has been a misfortune for Britain that through two years when diplomacy has been critically important we have been represented abroad by a jester.”One who would whole-heartedly agree is Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson who all but called him a liar as the EU referendum reached its climax and has followed it up with regular jibes ever since. She was one of the first out the blocks from outside the Cabinet this week to support the Prime Minister after Johnson’s resignation over the Chequers Brexit plan.But, at the same time, fundamentalist Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Iain Duncan-Smith were preparing amendments to the Customs Bill which, when it comes up for debate in the Commons on Monday, could yet rip the guts out the White Paper which followed the Chequers plan.READ MORE: Theresa May to Boris Johnson: ‘It is only right your should step down’            So what are we humble foot soldiers, the Conservative councillors and activists who must take all this out to the public, to make of it all? With a subject so vast boiled down to one word “Leave”, no party has found unanimous agreement within their ranks about what it should mean, no matter what they might tell the public. Even First Minister Nicola Sturgeon knows there are 400,000 SNP supporters like Jim Sillars who want as little to do with Brussels as they do London. The Prime Minister’s responsibility is to construct a viable way forward for the negotiations which honours the referendum result but addresses the realpolitik of the situation, which is what she appeared to have done. Not the finished article, but real progress nonetheless,  Good deal, bad deal or no deal (and every trader knows the other side must think you will walk away, no matter the consequences), what the poor bloody Conservative infantry need more than anything else is a sense of purpose and direction, a solid position we can defend and promote. Finally, last weekend we got one, until the egos started to land. The alternative to Ruth Davidson’s call to put “shoulders to the wheel” in support of the Chequers Plan is to play into the hands of the opposition. And guess what, as two party vice-chairs flounced out in protest, by the end of the week Labour had nudged ahead in the UK polls.Here, after we have fought so hard and effectively to get this far in Scotland, up chirruped Aberdeen South MP Ross Thomson. “The Brexit plan opening offer appears so diluted that we would be a vassal state,” he said, as if his seat was a UKIP target. Then, in what looked like a pitch to be Scotland Secretary in PM Bojo’s Barmy Cabinet, he went on to praise David Davis and Johnson for “standing by their principles”.             In the great game of Brexit, councillors like me are but bystanders like everyone else. Others are supposed to be looking after high affairs of state on our behalf as we get on with trying to get the roads fixed and the bins emptied, the licence and planning applications processed, the schools built.The aim for Team May, if I may be so bold, should be to get Brexit over the line, and the word from people a lot closer to this than me beyond the Conservative Party is that the key principles laid out in the Chequers blue-print, like customs alignment for manufactured goods and the end of free movement, are very close to doing just that. But by not seeking to answer every question now, detailed sector-by-sector negotiations can go into a phase where new relationships are forged at the right pace for each. The whips will be working overtime to avoid a defeat on Monday, but I will leave the final word to former Edinburgh councillor and MEP Struan Stevenson, whose poetry on Twitter took a slightly different approach to Ross Thomson:“An MP whose vision was blurred,Was an expert on polishing t**d.But his race to be crownedLeft him running agroundAnd looking faintly absurd...”And, in any case, as they say, you can’t polish a t**d, but you can roll it in glitter...”"},{"url":null,"title":"susan dalgety the party city where only musicians keep time","story":"        New Orleans has a soul like no other place on Earth and not even Mother Nature\u0026#8217s worst storms can break it, writes Susan Dalgety.                Death is everywhere in New Orleans. Its cemeteries, where the dead are buried above the ground because the city sits on water-logged earth, are a wildly popular tourist attraction.            So too are the gaudily painted coffins used at jazz funerals, while grinning skulls hang from the doorways of “authentic” voodoo stores, and the Museum of Death in the French Quarter boasts artefacts from serial killers and grisly crime-scene photographs.            “There have been a number of ‘falling down ovations’ (people fainting) so… prepare yourself before entering,” warns the museum’s website.It is perhaps not surprising that death is as much part of ‘N’awlins’ as Mardi Gras and jazz, given that life here is constant battle with Mother Nature, one that she usually wins.The city is squeezed onto a scrap of fragile land, sandwiched between the mighty Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain. Hurricanes batter its shores with crushing regularity, and with much of the city built below sea level, floods are a constant danger.Thirteen years ago, Hurricane Katrina, which claimed nearly 1,500 lives, destroyed half the city’s homes and decimated its population, almost broke its spirit.And the response of the Bush administration, which idled while New Orleans drowned, exposed the mighty US federal government as not only ill-prepared for a disaster that was all too predictable, but hard-hearted, bordering on racist.            It was mostly poor African Americans who were trapped in the city after the deluge, waving frantically from rooftops for help that was slow in coming, or sweltering for days in the fetid Superdome, without fresh water or sanitation. Everyone else had been able to flee.READ MORE: Susan Dalgety: A land born of racism and slavery returns to its rootsBut New Orleans has bounced back, as it has done many times since it was established 300 years ago. In a bitter foretaste of its future, the fledgling city was destroyed by a hurricane only four years after the first houses were built.“There is no other city like it in the USA,” explained Cordell, who finally made to the move from LA to NOLA – an acronym for New Orleans, Louisiana – a few months ago.            “I had been coming here a lot to party so, as I can work anywhere, it made a lot of sense to move here.“I have a condo just round the corner,” he went on, waving his bottle of IPA in the vague direction of his French Quarter flat. “It costs me a third of what I was paying in California, and I get all this.” All this is a non-stop party.We met Cordell in a bar frequented by locals, and the occasional wide-eyed tourists wandering in off the street, attracted by the raucous laughter.At four in the afternoon, the party was in full swing. James, squeezed into a silver, sequinned jacket three sizes too small, was drinking Bud from a champagne flute, while handing out stuffed toys from a large bag under his seat.“He always does that, he’s got a big heart,” explained Cordell, who came back from the bathroom with a penguin.            Shortly after we arrived, a roar went round the bar as another regular, rather the worse for wear, announced he was buying everyone a drink. Shots of Jameson were quickly poured in plastic glasses and passed round.Someone shouted, “this is going to be a night to remember!” Cordell shrugged and said, “I am not sure I want to stay forever in New Orleans, maybe there is too much partying. Perhaps I will travel ... Belize, or Spain, or south-east Asia. What do you think of Spain, or Portugal?”And before we could answer, the conversation turned, as it usually does, to “that man”.“I see you have a Baby Trump,” laughed Cordell. “That is a brilliant idea. He will hate that. God, we hate him. He is so embarrassing.“Obama was such a good president, you know. He was honest. Organised. Intelligent. He knew stuff. We were proud of him ... well, most of us.“Even George W was better than this man. He is a gangster, no, he is the worst gangster, a crack-head, low-life gangster. We are so angry, and ashamed.”READ MORE: Susan Dalgety: The fault line that runs through the big heart of the USThere was nothing more to be said about President Trump, so we bought another drink, and toasted New Orleans, a city like no other.Earlier in the day, we had visited Congo Square, in the Treme district, just beyond the fabled French Quarter and its hordes of drunken tourists, clutching plastic shot glasses, almost throttled by their cheap carnival beads.We were alone, except for the ghosts of Africans, stolen from their lands to be slaves in colonial Louisiana.Two hundred years ago, these men and women would gather every Sunday to remember their culture, to sing and dance and for a few, short hours, forget that they were no longer free.It was here, in this square, that the drums and banjos of Africa, suppressed elsewhere in buttoned-up Protestant America, merged with European influences and jazz was born.From the mid 19th century, the square was called Beauregard Square after a Confederate general, until 2011 when its original name was restored.“Jazz is the only truly indigenous American art form,” declared the city ordinance, “and arguably its genesis was Congo Square, a true gift to the entire country and the world.”That most Southern of gentlemen, the playwright Tennessee Williams, made New Orleans his home for much of his life.He once wrote, “In New Orleans ... I found the kind of freedom I always needed, and the shock of it, against the Puritanism of my nature, has given me a subject, a theme which I have never ceased exploiting.”New Orleans still has the capacity to shock. Bourbon Street after eight o’clock at night is not for the faint-hearted. Poverty still stalks the Lower Ninth Ward where Katrina did the most damage, and violent crime remains stubbornly high.It has been often been described as the worst-organised city in America, where the only people who keep time are the musicians.But it has a soul like no other city. A spirit rooted in the villages of West Africa, the plantations of Louisiana, and the shacks of Treme.The ancient rhythms and heartsick blues of New Orleans have lifted the world, soothed its soul, and made it want to dance.No-one, not even Mother Nature herself, can stop the life force that is N’awlins."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768262.1531468928!/image/image.jpg","title":"progress at north sea s catcher field gives boost to premier","story":"        Premier Oil has hailed progress at a major North Sea field.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations.

Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney.

Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s

the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those

conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH0607NCA.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27404  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nThe message must go loud and clear to London that the Backstop agreed in December is the bottom-line. - Mary Lou McDonald TD\nThe Brexit backstop agreed in December is the bottom line and must remain in place, Sinn Féin President Mary Lou has told the President of the EU Commission, Jean Claude Juncker. \nThe Sinn Féin President was speaking after the EU Commission President addressed a joint sitting of the Oireachtas in Leinster House today. \nAlongside the Sinn Féin TDs and Seanadóirí, Sinn Féin MPs and Martina Anderson MEP were also in the Oireachtas chamber for the speech. \nThe EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, was also in the gallery in the Dáil chamber for the speech. \nJean Claude Juncker told the joint sitting that \"Ireland will come first\" in the Brexit negotiations. \nHe also said dismissed the recent proposal from the British government for the backstop agreed in December to apply to Britain, saying it was  designed for the specific circumstances for the north of Ireland. \n\nThe EU Commission President also warned Britain that time is running out to come up with a deal. \"We need more answers and fewer questions,\" he said Oireachtas members and guests. \nMary Lou McDonald described Brexit as \"the biggest threat in a generation to our all-Ireland economy, our peace agreements and to the rights of our citizens\" and added that Ireland must not become collateral damage to the narrow agenda of right-wing British Tories. \nThe Sinn Féin President also said Theresa May and the British government have not put forward any credible proposals and said their approach \"remains littered with long-standing contradictions.\" \n\"The outworking of these unresolved contradictions in British policy is clear. As it stands, the British position would impose a hard border on the island of Ireland. That is a fact. As it stands the British position would erect barriers to east-west trade.

McMonagle\n\nWhat we have witnessed here is a sustained and a calculated attack on the community of the Bogside, spilling into the Fountain and the whole of the city of Derry.\nThe people of Derry will take to the streets tonight to challenge what Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald has described as the \"warped, negative, regressive , and dangerous\" agenda of those behind the disturbances that have occurred in the city\u0027s Bogside area in recent nights. \nA rally in solidarity with the local community will be held in the city tonight at 7pm, supported by a range of parties and organisations, at Fahan Street/Butcher Gate. \nIt follows several nights of disturbances in the area which included a gun attack on PSNI officers, several blast bombs and dozens of petrol bombs. \nSome of those involved in the disturbances have been young children. \nThe Sinn Féin leader encouraged as many people as possible to attend tonight\u0027s rally to show solidarity with the people of the Bogside and Fountain and to send a clear message that there is no support for the violence witnessed over the last week. \nMary Lou McDonald made the comments in the Bogside this afternoon alongside Sinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O\u0027Neill as they met with local residents and community leaders and ahead of a meeting with PSNI Chief Constable, George Hamilton, to discuss the violence. \n\nSpeaking to the media at the Gasyard Centre in the Bogside, Mary Lou McDonald said those behind the violence had a \"warped agenda\" and \"cynical, calculated manipulation of young people.\" \n\"What we have witnessed here is a sustained and a calculated attack on the community of the Bogside, spilling into the Fountain and the whole of the city of Derry,\" she said. \n\"What we have seen here is a deliberate strategy by those who would style themselves as dissidents to misuse, mislead and manipulate children and to cause fear, hardship and anger across this community. \n\"But they have also created a sense of determination, Because this is Derry and because the Bogside is the Bogside and the people here aren\u0027t having it. This is the city of Martin McGuinness, of John Hume, of civil rights, this is the maiden city, these are proud communities and this evening the people of the Bogside and beyond will come on to the street and stand shoulder to shoulder to face the thuggery, the criminality, the manipulation and the warped thinking of a small, small minority of people who would wish to cause damage here,\" the Sinn Féin leader added. \nMary Lou McDonald also said the local community are angry and that what has happened is not a reflection of the vast majority of local people. \n\"This is every reflection on warped, negative, regressive , dangerous people who think it is OK to manipulate young people and young children to throw petrol bombs and the like for an agenda that is nothing but a road to absolutely nowhere bar anger, fear and destruction,\" she explained. \nThe Sinn Féin President also said the PSNI have a responsibility to keep people safe but laid the blame for the disturbances squarely on dissident groupings. \n\"There is a sense in the community that the police need to do more, that there needs to be a more effective engagement but let me be clear about this, we will talk to George Hamilton about all of those things but be clear here who the instigator of this hardship is, let\u0027s be clear on that.

interest in copper barns","story":"\nA unique housing development in Broughshane is attracting interest from international buyers.  \n\n                \nAntrim-based construction company Loft Estates is in the process of completing work on its award winning Copper Barns development, which sits on a 4.5 acre rural site overlooking Slemish Mountain and the Braid Valley. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe £1.3m investment in three state-of-the-art homes, was part funded by Danske Bank. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe company is

Dinsmore, Director at Loft Estates, said: “We have been overwhelmed with the public response to this project which has also received a RICS award for architecture.  \n\n“So far, we’ve sold two homes to legal professionals from London and there have been enquiries from around the world about the third and final property on the development.” \n\nHe added: “The homes are entirely bespoke and whilst they are very contemporary in design, the overall concept works because they relate back to the original stone barns they replaced.  \n\n“We have one barn remaining and will start this in conjunction with the new buyer so they can be involved in customising it to suit their own individual requirements.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n

we have with our Relationship Manager.  \n\n“We operate a number of businesses and a pension fund and Danske Bank really took the time to understand our quite varied needs across this portfolio, so it was an easy decision to switch.”\n\nMichelle Wilson, Business Banking Manager at Danske Bank, commented: “The Copper Barns development is the latest project from Connor and his team and as ever they continue to innovate and excite.  \n\n“A combination of award winning design coupled with quality driven construction has proven to be a winning recipe for the company and we are excited to see what
