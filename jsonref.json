He never raised his voice that made everyone lean in to hear him. But he wasn\u0027t funny. Funny she learned from Mike Nichols.She was set to play Maria Callas in an HBO movie when Nichols died of cardiac arrest in November 2014.She described her close friend as \u0027an indelible, irreplaceable man\u0027.Had she not been an actress, Streep says she\u0027d probably work with the environmental movement.She became alarmed by the thinning ozone layer while filming in Australia where residents were suffering high levels of melanoma that carved away sections of their faces.She became spokesperson for a group recommended by Robert Redford, the national Resources Defense Council and became the public face of the anti-pesticide campaign.Her support helped to get a bill passed that required chemical and pesticide companies to register all pesticides on the market – as well as create awareness of eco-friendly consumer products.She has been raising her voice since 1990 and funded an annuaI four day script development lab for women screenwriters over the age of forty working with NY Women in Film and Television.\u0027I\u0027m a humanist and I believe in women\u0027s rights,\u0027 she stated and went after Walt Disney studios in 2014 for supporting an anti-Semitic industry lobby as well as being a gender bigot.Streep has made more than 60 feature films, played dozens of accents, had one husband and raised four children.\u0027No matter what you see me or hear me saying when I\u0027m on your TV, hold a statuette and spewing – that\u0027s acting.\u0027Being a celebrity has taught me to hide.

Another 20,000 jobs in the supply chain were put at risk by the collapse of the talks between the Government and British Steel’s owner, private equity firm Greybull.Unions cautiously welcomed the announcement. But defence experts raised concerns over the apparent ties between Oyak – whose chairman is former army general Mehmet Tas – and President Recep Erdogan’s government in Turkey. The country’s defence minister and head of armed forces attended Oyak’s annual general meeting in May, the Financial Times reported.         The deal with Oyak is expected to be signed in two months once the company\u0027s finances are checked. (Pictured: Oyak\u0027s logo)         The military pension fund also owns steelworks in Turkey and is believed to have offered around £70million for the business in a deal that could save almost 4,000 jobs. (Pictured: Red hot steel being rolled out at British Steel\u0027s Scunthorpe plant, Lincolnshire, in 2016)Turkey remains an ally through Nato but it has cosied up to Russia in recent years, forging defence ties over Syria.Dr Julian Lewis, defence committee chairman, said: ‘No industry with a strong defence dimension should pass out of the control of British firms and jurisdiction.‘Turkey was once a strong and reliable Nato ally, as far as Russia is concerned, and a Muslim country that separated religion from politics. What’s particularly concerning is that neither of those things is true today.‘While the proposed deal is better than seeing the industry collapse completely, it is much less desirable than having the company under British control.’Oyak has also been accused of corruption by a parliamentary commission in its home country.Dr Andrew Foxall, of think-tank, the Henry Jackson Society, said: ‘Recep Erdogan has set the country on a course toward authoritarianism in recent years.‘Flirting with Russia and China while oppressing its people, Turkey is increasingly turning its back on the West.‘Given that British Steel is crucial to our national infrastructure, the Government should consider extra steps to safeguard it under Turkish ownership.’         British Steel was put into compulsory liquidation in May after rescue talks with the Government broke down. (Pictured: The British Steel plant in Scunthorpe in 2008, where 3,000 people are currently employed)         Turkey remains an ally through Nato but it has cosied up to Russia in recent years, forging defence ties over Syria.(Pictured: British Steel logo at the Scunthorpe plant in 2019)Steel is considered a strategic industry, because companies like British Steel provide materials to build warships and railways.Oyak, which will purchase the plants through subsidiary Ataer Holdings, offered around £70million in line with other bidders including Liberty Steel, which rescued mills in Wales, Yorkshire and Scotland in 2017.Roy Rickhuss, of union Community, said: ‘This is an important milestone, and will be hugely encouraging to the workforce.‘We will want to be assured that Ataer has a long-term strategy to invest in the assets and develop the business.’Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said: ‘This is an important and positive step forward in securing the future of British Steel. I am committed to a modern and sustainable future for the industry that is productive and supports a skilled and highly valued workforce.’Oyak said it is run by independent managers, does not receive contributions from the Turkish government and adheres to strict corporate governance principles.  RUTH SUNDERLAND: My family of steelworkers built the world. How they would loathe this sell-off Commentary by Ruth SunderlandSteel is not just another industry, not to me. It’s in my soul, my blood, my DNA. Generations of men in my family worked in the blast furnaces on Teesside, including my late father and my maternal granddad.So when I say I feel for the people of Scunthorpe, a steel town just like my own, it runs deep.I know that there are thousands of families who have lived through months of agonising fear since British Steel went into receivership in May. There are some in Teesside too, where it still has around 700 staff, the remnant of an operation that once sustained an entire region.Believe me, then, when I say I understand the relief, even jubilation at the news that the Turkish army pension scheme has offered to buy the business and save those jobs. But I’m genuinely sorry to say that the deal fills me with a deep sense of unease and foreboding.         Steel is not just another industry, not to me. It’s in my soul, my blood, my DNA, writes Ruth Sunderland. (Pictured: A view of British Steel\u0027s plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, in 2019)         Generations of men in my family worked in the blast furnaces on Teesside, including my late father and my maternal granddad, writes Ruth Sunderland. (Pictured: The British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, pictured in 2019)My fear is that a Turkish takeover will prove yet another chapter of despair for the gallant steelmen who have endured so much. The army is, of course, closely tied to President Erdogan, Turkey’s authoritarian leader, who has recently been holding talks over arms deals with Russian president Vladimir Putin.Why does the Turkish military, via its pension scheme, want to get its hands on our steel? Is it just an investment, or is another agenda in play?And why, given we have our own pension funds controlling trillions of pounds of assets, can’t it be sold to one of our own?Perhaps potential British buyers are influenced by the pervasive myth that steel in this country is dying and not worth propping up. Nothing could be further from the truth. Despite all the woes inflicted in the past four decades, our manufacturers produce 8million tonnes of high-quality steel a year. The industry employs 32,000 people directly and more than 52,000 on top of that in the supply chain.Of course, the sector is much smaller than in the past. As recently as the early-Seventies, it employed more than 300,000 people, my dad and granddad among them.The sad reality is we have allowed it to wither away through a combination of short-sighted government policies and shoddy ownership, not through inherent problems with the workforce or the product. The Scunthorpe steelworks has been passed like a parcel from one unsatisfactory owner to another and there is nothing about the proposed Turkish takeover to suggest this shameful record has changed.         So when I say I feel for the people of Scunthorpe, a steel town just like my own, it runs deep, writes Ruth Sunderland. (Pictured: British Steel\u0027s Scunthorpe plant in 2015)Most recently it was owned by Greybull Capital, a company founded and run by a group of super-rich private equity barons. They took it over for a token £1 in 2016, revived the old British Steel brand name and promised to restore its fortunes. This spring, just three years later, the Official Receiver was called in. Before that, it was owned by Indian conglomerate Tata.Steel-making is by its nature a cyclical business and there are times when it needs a helping hand, yet successive UK governments have failed to offer one.Instead, they have pursued policies that put our industry at a grave disadvantage.Plants are subjected to heavy business rates and they are forced to pay 51 per cent more for the electricity they use than German producers and 110 per cent more than French steelmakers. The uncertainty over Brexit has not helped. If there is No Deal, much of our steel exports could be subjected to big tariffs.Yet demand is rising around the world and could be filled by UK producers. Steel is needed to make virtually everything from wind turbines to trains, buildings, cars and coins. It is also, of course, key to our defence industry.Surely this gives pause for thought that a Turkish army retirement fund, run by a former general, is being hailed as a saviour?If British Steel is sold off, at the very least the UK government should insist on keeping a golden share and a seat on the board so we have some control.There are things the Government can do now even now to save our steel. Boris Johnson has said he wants to kick-start infrastructure projects.He should set a priority on buying British steel for all of them. Only 43 per cent of the steel procured by the UK government is sourced domestically at present.My father was made redundant from the steelworks in the 1980s. It broke his heart, and it makes me sad and angry even now, but it is a consolation that the steel he and other Teessiders made is everywhere from the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Churchill’s War Rooms in Whitehall.When I took my niece there a couple of years ago, my heart thumped in my chest when I pointed out the manufacturer’s name on the girders, a marker of her heritage and mine.Yes, I am emotional about this, but there are hard facts to support my belief that steel in this country not only has a great past but could also have a great future. Will it be achieved through this Turkish deal? Sadly, I doubt it."},{"url":null,"title":"Jeremy Corbyn calls vacant high street shops given community projects","story":"Share this article ‘Labour has a radical plan to revive Britain’s struggling high streets by turning the blight of empty shops into the heart of the high street, with thousands of new businesses and projects getting the chance to fulfil their potential.’Labour local government spokesman Andrew Gwynne said: ‘Under this Government, our high streets have suffered a retail apocalypse.‘High street closures are at a historic high, leaving too many of our once thriving towns abandoned and awash with boarded up shop fronts.          Mr Corbyn, pictured in Machynlleth, Wales, on Friday, said letting startups and community projects use the empty space would help reverse the ‘economic decay’ of town centres\u0027Labour will turn around the mess the Tories created and will give local authorities the power to make our high streets the pride of our communities that they once were.’But Jake Berry, the Tory local growth minister, claimed: ‘Jeremy Corbyn would wreck the economy, tax small businesses and scare off the investment needed to help our high streets, meaning more boarded-up shops and fewer jobs.‘We will deliver Brexit by October 31 so that we can get on with levelling up opportunities across our country and breathe new life into high streets and town centres.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c877620ab8bf207b52ffa86ca17cf1fb7b50de0/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0fc36814002ddcfd4d88e64d99750be","title":"buy a classic guardian photograph szechenyi baths budapest august 2006","story":"This week in our  Print Shop series we have an image shot by David Levene of the Szechenyi Baths in BudapestMen play chess while submerged to the shoulders in the hot, mineral-rich waters of the Szechenyi thermal baths in Budapest.

The event was estimated to have attracted 600 people at its peak.Videos posted to social media show the rival groups pushing and shoving one another before being separated by police.A Victoria police spokeswoman confirmed two men were interviewed in relation to unlawful assault, before being released pending summons.“We respect the right of the community to express their views peacefully and lawfully but will not tolerate those who break the law or engage in antisocial or violent behaviour,” she said.Similar protests were also held in Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney, and follow months of demonstrations in Hong Kong.Hong Kong has been plunged into its biggest political crisis since the former British colony’s return to Chinese rule in 1997, with a wave of protests against a now suspended extradition bill which would see people sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts.The protests, which started in April have now transformed into broader demands including the resignation of Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam and calls for a “free Hong Kong”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a8926dd911851304d36a789b398adbcf2fbb74/311_227_4305_2583/master/4305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94335921fa2f1a2002e9361360390394","title":"rolled over why did married couples stop sleeping in twin beds","story":"A new cultural history shows that until the 1950s, forward-thinking couples regarded sharing a bed as old-fashioned and unhealthy“The twin-bed seems to have come to stay,” proclaimed the Yorkshire Herald in 1892, “and will no doubt in time succeed the double bed in all rooms occupied by two persons”.The proclamation may have proved less than accurate, but for almost a century between the 1850s and 1950s, separate beds were seen as a healthier, more modern option for couples than the double, with Victorian doctors warning that sharing a bed would allow the weaker sleeper to drain the vitality of the stronger.Delving through marriage guidance and medical advice books, furniture catalogues and novels, Lancaster University professor Hilary Hinds found that twin beds were initially adopted in the late 19th century as a health precaution.In her new book, A Cultural History of Twin Beds, Hinds details how doctors warned of the dire consequences of bed-sharing. In 1861, doctor, minister and health campaigner William Whitty Hall’s book Sleep: Or the Hygiene of the Night, advised that each sleeper “should have a single bed in a large, clean, light room, so as to pass all the hours of sleep in a pure fresh air, and that those who fail in this, will in the end fail in health and strength of limb and brain, and will die while yet their days are not all told”.In the 1880s, a series of articles by Dr Benjamin Ward Richardson warned of the risks of inhaling a bedfellow’s germs: “I cannot do better than commence what I have to say concerning beds and bedding by protesting against the double bed. The system of having beds in which two persons can sleep is always, to some extent, unhealthy.”Some doctors believed that sharing a bed would allow the stronger sleeper to rob the vitality of the weaker one wrote of how a “pale, sickly and thin boy” had been sharing a bed with his grandmother, “a very aged person”. When they were separated at night, “the recovery was rapid”.In 1858, Dr James Copland warned: “But it is not in children only that debility is induced by this mode of abstracting vital power … Young females married to very old men suffer in a similar manner, although seldom to so great an extent … These facts are often well known to the aged themselves, who consider the indulgence favourable to longevity, and thereby often illustrate the selfishness which, in some persons, increases with their years.”By the 1920s, twin beds were seen as a fashionable, modern choice. “Separate beds for every sleeper are as necessary as are separate dishes for every eater,” wrote Dr Edwin Bowers in his 1919 volume, Sleeping for Health. “They promote comfort, cleanliness, and the natural delicacy that exists among human beings.”Published by Bloomsbury Collections and funded by the Wellcome Trust, Hinds’s book lays out how, by the 1930s, twin beds were commonplace in middle-class households. But by the 1940s, writes Hinds, “they can occasion an unmistakable curl of the lip” and are “no longer the preserve of the health-conscious forward-thinking middle classes”.Separate beds began to be seen as a sign of a distant or failing marriage in the 1950s. In 1956, birth-control advocate and eugenicist Marie Stopes railed against them: “Many of their inhabitants get devitalised, irritable, sleepless and unhappy, I think, because of them. The twin bed set was an invention of the Devil, jealous of married bliss,” she wrote in her final book, Sleep. By the 1960s, their cachet had gone.Hinds did not set out to write about beds: she was researching interwar fiction written by women, and kept seeing references to separate beds. “I assumed they signified what they signify now, some kind of marital distance or sexual dysfunction,” she said. She went back to a household scrapbook of her great-grandmother’s, from the 1880s, which included a newspaper cutting warning against the dangers of habitual bed sharing. “I thought I might write an article … I really didn’t expect to write a book.”Despite all her research, Hinds said that she has not been tempted into acquiring twin beds. “I find myself moved by what they seem to represent about taking charge of that marital nocturnal environment, doing something different with it, rather than just doing what we’d always done in the past,” she said. “But I am a creature of my historical moment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce486f207a3f8c71c08d1784edad1904a6db3af2/61_0_1961_1177/master/1961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=915e058fee1d3dcbbf988458454d1900","title":"art spiegelman golden age superheroes were shaped by the rise of fascism","story":"Created in New York by Jewish immigrants, the first comic book superheroes were mythic saviours who could combat the Nazi threat. They speak to the dark politics of out timesBack in the benighted 20th century comic books were seen as subliterate trash for kiddies and intellectually challenged adults – badly written, hastily drawn and execrably printed. Martin Goodman, the founder and publisher of what is now known as Marvel Comics, once told Stan Lee that there was no point in trying to make the stories literate or worry about character development: “Just give them a lot of action and don’t use too many words.” It’s a genuine marvel that this formula led to works that were so resonant and vital.The comic book format can be credited to a printing salesman, Maxwell Gaines, looking for a way to keep newspaper supplement presses rolling in 1933 by reprinting collections of popular newspaper comic strips in a half-tabloid format. As an experiment, he slapped a 10 cents sticker on a handful of the free pamphlets and saw them quickly sell out at a local newsstand. Soon most of the famous funnies were being gathered into comic books by a handful of publishers – and new content was needed at cheap reprint rates. This new material was mostly made up of third-rate imitations of existing newspaper strips, or genre stories echoing adventure, detective, western or jungle pulps. As Marshall McLuhan once pointed out, every medium subsumes the content of the medium that precedes it before it finds its own voice.Enter Jerry Siegel, an aspiring teenage writer, and Joe Shuster, a young would-be artist – both nerdy alienated Jewish misfits many decades before that was remotely cool. They dreamed of the fame, riches and admiring glances from girls that a syndicated strip might bring, and developed their idea of a superhuman alien from a dying planet who would fight for truth, justice and the values of President Roosevelt’s New Deal. Barely out of childhood themselves, the boys’ idea was rejected by the newspaper syndicates as naive, juvenile and unskilled, before Gaines bought their 13 pages of Superman samples for Action Comics at 10 bucks a page – a fee that included all rights to the character. Not only was Siegel and Shuster’s creation the model for the brand new genre that came to define the medium, their lives were the tragic paradigm for creators bilked of the large rewards their creations brought their publishers.It is generally agreed that Superman launched the golden age of comics in June 1938 with his debut in Action Comics #1, published by what is now known as DC Comics. Siegel and Shuster had created a new archetype – or perhaps, more accurately, a new stereotype – and by 1940, once the nascent genre had demonstrated that it could get kids to part with millions of dimes per month, swarms of imitators catapulted hordes of four-colour heroes into the skies, all chasing the gold in this golden age. The juvenile naivety of Superman was, it seems, actually part of its allure, inviting youngsters into a new especially kid-friendly kind of story whose fantasies were even more unfettered by logic than most prose pulp fiction, all presented with diagrammatic visuals in primary and secondary colours that could make every page a theatre curtain to be raised on to new eyeball kicks and … action.Goodman, trend-surfing publisher of some lurid pulps, was one of the first to ride the superhero wave, immediately making a giant splash with his first issue of Marvel Comics in October 1939. (The first printing of 80,000 copies was followed by a reprint of 800,000 more.) The content was provided by Funnies, Inc, a comic book packager that could produce complete comics from concept to finished art for nascent publishers who wanted to keep their overheads low. These “shops” had something in common with the garment district sweatshops that many of the artists’ family members worked in. Usually done as piecework while punching a time clock with many hands (script-writers, pencillers, inkers and letterers) all attacking the original pages almost simultaneously, this was more a small industry than an art form.It recruited green youngsters, washed up old hacks and even – when the second world war came along and drafted many of the young men who filled the growing demand for comics – women, people of colour and other interlopers. (Those interlopers, by the way, still had to provide the racist and sexist stereotypes that have long been a touchstone of the whole medium.)At this point, it might be worth pointing out (not out of ethnic pride, but because it might shed some light on the rawness and the specific themes of the early comics) that the pioneers behind this embryonic medium based in New York were predominantly Jewish and from ethnic minority backgrounds. It wasn’t just Siegel and Shuster, but a whole generation of recent immigrants and their children – those most vulnerable to the ravages of the great depression – who were especially attuned to the rise of virulent antisemitism in Germany. They created the American Übermenschen who fought for a nation that would at least nominally welcome “your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free … ”To namecheck just a few of these secular Jews who had adopted Clark Kent-like secret identities: Gaines was born Max Ginzberg Goodman’s parents immigrated from Vilnius, Lithuania Jack Kirby (né Jacob Kurtzberg), the powerhouse who co-created Captain America with his landsman Joe Simon, was born in the slums of New York’s Lower East Side and Stan Lee, who became the face of Marvel Comics, was Goodman’s wife’s cousin, nepotistically hired as a 17‑year-old office boy named Stanley Lieber. Though not welcome in the higher precincts of advertising and publishing, they were all able to find their niche at the bottom of the barrel.The unseasoned artists in these comics factories discovered the possibilities of a new form while under do-or-die deadline pressures. They picked up their skills by copying each other and by stealing directly from the masters of the newspaper adventure comics: Alex Raymond (Flash Gordon, Secret Agent X-9), Hal Foster (Tarzan, Prince Valiant) and Milton Caniff (Terry and the Pirates). On the other hand, Carl Burgos (né Max Finkelstein), who created the lead feature in Marvel Comics #1, The Human Torch, proudly said: “If they wanted Raymond or Caniff they could look at Raymond or Caniff. The miserable drawing was all mine.” A writer-artist, his then rudimentary drawing skills were buttressed by an intuitive visual storytelling ability and were applied to an inspired character: The Human Torch. The character – an anthropomorphised streak of red and yellow flame – had a graphic intensity that burned its way into readers’ eyeballs and personified the raw crackling energy of the early comic books before they were domesticated.William Blake “Bill” Everett, Burgos’s comrade at Funnies, Inc, was an oddity in comics. For one thing, he wasn’t Jewish. Everett came from a 300-year-old patrician Massachusetts family and he really was a direct descendant of his namesake. He came to the outsider status that drew him to comics via an addictive personality – he was a heavy drinker from the age of 12 and had a three-pack-a-day cigarette habit – or maybe it was an outsider’s sensibility that drove him to drink. He was one of the most gifted artists ever to work in comic books. He drew fluidly, was comfortable in many genres, and had a sense of page design that allowed the reader’s eye to find buried visual treasures while swimming effortlessly through a story.His alienated antihero, Namor, the Sub-Mariner, was the forefather of a long line of troubled characters that would populate the Marvel universe a couple of decades later. In the 1940s the Sub-Mariner was singular – a marked contrast to the square and square-jawed vigilante do-gooders who lived in the less scruffy DC Comics neighbourhood. Never fully at home in the ocean or in the air, Namor was proud, arrogant and more volatile than the Human Torch, his complementary opposite. But water and fire combined to bring Marvel Comics to an elemental boil.In late 1940, over a year before Pearl Harbor, while the Nazis were Blitzkrieging London, Simon, an entrepreneurial freelancer for Funnies, Inc, was hired by Goodman to write, draw and edit for him directly. Simon showed him the cover concept for a new superhero that he and Kirby had dreamed up – a hero dressed like an American flag with giant biceps and abs of steel has just burst into Nazi headquarters and knocked Hitler over with a haymaker to the jaw. Goodman began to tremble, knowing what an impact this book would make and remained anxious until the first issue of Captain America, dated March 1941, landed on the stands. Goodman had been terrified that someone might assassinate Hitler before the comic book came out!Captain America was a recruiting poster, battling against the real Nazi super-villains while Superman was still fighting cheap gunsels, strike breakers, greedy landlords and Lex Luthor – and America was still equivocating about entering the conflict at all. No wonder Simon and Kirby’s comic book became an enormous hit, selling close to a million copies a month throughout the war. But not everyone was a fan in 1941 – according to Simon, the German American Bund and America Firsters bombarded the publisher’s offices with hate mail and obscene phone calls that screamed “Death to the Jews!” Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, a real-life superhero, called to reassure him, saying: “The city of New York will see that no harm comes to you.”Kirby’s hyperkinetic figures with hypertrophied muscles left human anatomy in the dust. His characters were bellicose, humourless, single-minded and angry as they burst out of saw-toothed panels and widescreen spreads. His art set the tone for superheroic action, not just during the war years, but ever since.I know that Kirby was a protean original as a comic book creator as well as a genuine war hero, but I confess that I have a blind spot when it comes to the superhero genre that grew out of the template he set. Even when I was 12, superheroes were my methadone – I was deeply addicted to satire magazines such as Mad, and the old newspaper comics I discovered in my public library’s bound volumes. I preferred more mature fare like Donald Duck and Little Lulu. You see, I love the form of comics – the pages full of co-mixed words and pictures butting up against each other, all those little boxes you have to compare and contrast to pry out the narrative juice and I adore the weird idiosyncrasies of cartoon language in all its accents. Those who find superheroes the alpha and omega of comics date the end of the golden age to some time in the postwar 1940s when interest in the genre faded.Disenchanted GIs, no longer an eager and captive audience, may have realised that it wasn’t Captain America who won the war. Maybe it was the Russians! In any case, demobilised soldiers either grew out of the comic book habit or shifted their attention to other genres. Crime, cowboy, romance, horror and war-themed comics flourished, often with more mature – and even lurid – content designed for older readers.I date the end of the golden age to 1954. A moral panic built on the false assumption that the medium was strictly for young kids and was turning them into juvenile delinquents had led to comic-book burnings and to US Senate hearings that ultimately put many publishers out of business and maimed the rest. Sanitised superheroes brought the medium off life support in 1956 (now hailed as the beginning of the silver age) but the medium never regained the ubiquity it had in its heyday – as comic books. As movies, they have conquered the world!Back in the golden age, if you wanted to see some guy in a cape fly over a skyscraper or turn New York City into rubble, comic book panels were the most satisfying delivery system. In the 21st century, thanks to the miracle of CGI, many millions of people around the globe who have never read a comic or heard of graphic novels go to their multiplexes to worship the new deities that embody the DNA of comics.The young Jewish creators of the first superheroes conjured up mythic – almost god-like – secular saviours to deal with the threatening economic dislocations that surrounded them in the great depression and gave shape to their premonitions of impending global war. Comics allowed readers to escape into fantasy by projecting themselves on to invulnerable heroes.Auschwitz and Hiroshima make more sense as dark comic book cataclysms than as events in our real world. In today’s all too real world, Captain America’s most nefarious villain, the Red Skull, is alive on screen and an Orange Skull haunts America. International fascism again looms large (how quickly we humans forget – study these golden age comics hard, boys and girls!) and the dislocations that have followed the global economic meltdown of 2008 helped bring us to a point where the planet itself seems likely to melt down. Armageddon seems somehow plausible and we’re all turned into helpless children scared of forces grander than we can imagine, looking for respite and answers in superheroes flying across screens in our chapel of dreams.While the content of comic books has hijacked our cinema, the form of comics – cleverly disguised as graphic novels – has infiltrated what’s left of our literary culture. When the Folio Society, venerable publisher of luxurious illustrated books since 1947, decided to plunge in with a deluxe compilation of golden age Marvel comics, they invited me, as a graphic novelist and comic book scholar, to write an introduction to the book. Perhaps they misguidedly figured that I might lend the endeavour a fig leaf of respectability.I turned the essay in at the end of June, substantially the same as what appears here. A regretful Folio Society editor told me that Marvel Comics (evidently the co-publisher of the book) is trying to now stay “apolitical”, and is not allowing its publications to take a political stance. I was asked to alter or remove the sentence that refers to the Red Skull or the intro could not be published. I didn’t think of myself as especially political compared with some of my fellow travellers, but when asked to kill a relatively anodyne reference to an Orange Skull I realised that perhaps it had been irresponsible to be playful about the dire existential threat we now live with, and I withdrew my introduction.A revealing story serendipitously showed up in my news feed this week. I learned that the billionaire chairman and former CEO of Marvel Entertainment, Isaac “Ike” Perlmutter, is a longtime friend of Donald Trump’s, an unofficial and influential adviser and a member of the president’s elite Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. And Perlmutter and his wife have each recently donated $360,000 (the maximum allowed) to the Orange Skull’s “Trump Victory Joint Fundraising Committee” for 2020. I’ve also had to learn, yet again, that everything is political... just like Captain America socking Hitler on the jaw."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/865217af487883aeb5e84c8a79b0ddbb04cebf19/0_338_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a8c11e8c920ee736a7008e224e8c008","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s start with a beautiful example of nominative determinism. Isabella Tree’s Wilding has affected Wellfitbooty “more than any book I’ve read in many years”:It’s the story of a large farm in Sussex, England, which chose about 20 years ago to stop intensive farming and allow its lands to return to nature. It is now home to many threatened species, including the turtle dove and emperor butterfly is home to all 5 species of British owl, 11 species of bats – and countless other insects and birds.The author is one of the owners and the style is very readable and engaging – in fact I couldn’t put it down. The principles in the book can be applied to gardens of any size … I wholeheartedly recommend it.The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 and ¾ by Sue Townsend still works for writeronthestorm:Taking me back to my childhood when I borrowed this off my older brother and thought it was hilarious… It still stands up as a funny and enjoyable read. I’ve got the next couple of books in the series and will move onto them at some point.For the 15th time I think. I call it my summer book. It never fails to delight me.Mission To Tashkent by Frederick Marshman Bailey has impressed SchwarzwaldBummel:An incredible true-story romp about an English spy hired by Lenin’s Cheka to capture himself. Bailey a national treasure who deserves more recognition.“Thank you to everyone on here who recommended Elizabeth Taylor,” says Rick2016. “Without Tips, Links and Suggestions I’d never have discovered Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont, which proved wonderful”:It’s a quiet, understated book, but every line is so well crafted and has such power. The lessons it teaches are, when you write them down, obvious. Everyone needs love, physical contact, to feel wanted and like their company is a pleasure, not a burden. And yet it’s so easy to forget that everybody else feels these things in the cavalcade and clamour of everyday life.. Elizabeth Taylor’s empathy, compassion and ability to portray the irreducible human core of her characters are utterly remarkable and I thoroughly recommend Mrs Palfrey ... to anyone who hasn’t read it.More good work by you guys: FrogC has started reading When Mystical Creatures Attack by Kathleen Founds, “following a tip from a reader of this column”:It’s a series of linked short stories about a high-school class in Texas, most of them troubled, and their teacher who is equally so, being confined in a sort of capitalist asylum where they give Wellness Points(TM) for fulfilling various therapeutic tasks. The construction is ingenious - you might say gimmicky, but I like that kind of thing: the title story, for example, consists of the essays written by the students on how their favourite mythical creature might solve some world problem (though a lot of the problems chosen, inevitably, are on a more personal scale). Funny and moving. I love the fact that the most feared teacher is referred to simply as “The Sir”.Alexia_R has been pleased to pick up The Runaways by Fatima Bhutto:I picked this up on a whim in Foyles because it was a beautiful, signed copy. It’s a fast-paced story of three Pakistani young people (one of them British-Pakistani), negotiating their culture, religion etc. One of them is gay and struggling to accept it, another is from a very privileged background, another is from a slum of Karachi. I can’t say too much about the plot without giving it away. I was absolutely loving this and was about to praise it to the skies but I wasn’t too sure about the ending. Still, very good.RedmonT has almost finished Purity by Jonathan Franzen:Not quite as good as The Corrections and Freedom, but then that might only be because of how the account of Tom and Annabel’s relationship makes me feel. It’s awful – the feeling of dread I felt throughout that section, the nerves, the butterflies, the absurd behaviour. It’s been a long time since a book made me feel that way.He is amazing at threading stories together. It doesn’t even matter that it’s occasionally haphazard - realising things in a non-linear order affects the way you realise them (and changes what you thought you knew). There have been two or three moments that made me sit up and exclaim “FUCK” or “OH MY GOD”.I think he does something inwith his books that no other living writer does.Catch-22 attracts all the plaudits but this is well worth checking out as a study of the office environment and the feeling of ‘Is this all there is?’ It’s as sharp as TV’s Mad Men, which I suspect was influenced by it. I read about one third of the book in a single evening until the early hours. It’s that good.It is that good.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

With seven new models in seven years, his vision prepared the way to the firm’s landmark stock exchange listing last October, which heralded a new era for the 106-year-old British marque.The 10 months since then have not quite followed Palmer’s script. Aston Martin floated at £19 per share, valuing the firm at £4.3bn. If it had held that value it would now be in the FTSE 100 index of blue chip British businesses. Instead, the shares have lost three quarters of their value and they hit a record low on Thursday of less than £4, making it the worst-performing listing on the London Stock Exchange’s main market in the last two years. Aston Martin is now worth £1bn.Investors are now questioning whether James Bond’s favourite carmaker can make it through the next year without going back to markets to raise more cash to carry out its ambitious plans. Hedge funds are circling, with short sellers betting that the value of the company’s shares and debt will fall.The share price fall has followed repeated disappointments for investors: spiralling costs, supply chain disruptions and, most worryingly, a slump in sales.Aston Martin had forecast sales of about 7,250 cars in 2019, the first step on an ambitious path to almost double volumes to 14,000 in 2022. However, the company shocked investors in July by slashing its 2019 sales prediction to 6,400 because of economic uncertainty in the UK and Europe. That raised questions about whether its ambitious growth plans were a step too far.“They stuck to a story ‘that we’re going to sort ourselves organically’,” said Philippe Houchois, an analyst at US investment bank Jefferies. “The market doesn’t believe they can.”Investors at the initial public offering, who included employees and customers, thought they were buying the new Ferrari, with a James Bond twist. The Italian sports car-maker converted its exclusive brand into a booming stock in New York with a valuation about 35 times its annual earnings, a racy multiple more akin to a fast-growing luxury goods company than a metal-bashing carmaker.Investors are now left wondering whether the firm is, in fact, neither of those, but just the Aston Martin of old: a maker of good-looking status-symbol cars which has gone bust seven times since its beginnings in 1913.Aston Martin’s ambitions are staked on sales of its new DBX model. The company hopes that its first foray into the sports utility vehicle (SUV) market will become its most popular model, with 4,000 to be built in 2021.It is a well-worn path for luxury carmakers, following the success of Porsche’s Macan, now the German manufacturer’s best-selling car, Bentley’s Bentayga and Rolls-Royce’s hulking Cullinan. The first deliveries of the car, aimed particularly at multi-millionaire women in the US and China, are due in the second quarter of 2020, but spending on the new plant and the DBX launch will put short-term pressure on its cash holdings. And that is before the longer-term investments needed for electrification are taken into account.The share price fall has put immense pressure on Palmer, a former Nissan engineer who took over Aston Martin in 2014. He has already faced criticism over his high salary, although the share price fall means he is unlikely to be paid the entirety of a potential £6m bonus pot. Palmer sold shares worth £35.8m in the initial public offering (IPO) £29.2m went to cover future tax liabilities, while he kept £6.6m.If Aston Martin does need to raise money, investors will want something in return – new management or a new structure, said Houchois. Aston Martin declined to comment, but Palmer told reporters in Tokyo on Thursday that he had a preference for borrowing money rather than issuing new equity.Aston Martin raised no new capital as part of the stock market flotation, a decision that has come under scrutiny as its debt pile builds. But the selling shareholders certainly cashed in. Italian investor Investindustrial and a consortium of Kuwaiti funds raked in £1.1bn at the time of the IPO, which was led by bankers at Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Cazenove.Aston Martin made a loss of almost £80m in the first half of 2019, after making a profit of £21m in the same period last year. Those weaker sales prompted a wave of downgrades. Moody’s Investors Service, the influential credit rating agency, downgraded its rating on Aston Martin’s debt last month because of the poor sales growth. This week, Credit Suisse, another of the banks paid to find buyers at the time of the share sale, slashed its target price on Aston Martin shares in half to £5.29, saying that weaker sales had pushed up the company’s debt forecasts. Some analysts believe it is a question of when, rather than if, Aston Martin needs to raise more money and think it could be scooped up by a bigger rival.Nishad Subramaniam, an equity analyst at Brewin Dolphin, said last year’s stock exchange listing was “a great exit for its private owners but not so much for shareholders who have participated since”. He added: “Aston Martin Lagonda is running a tough balance sheet with high investment needs and therefore risks a liquidity event in which it might have to pursue the route of a rights issue as a means to continue funding operations. The brand arguably remains strong and therefore recent weak trading might garner some interest from one of the bigger automakers as a strategic purchase.”Some analysts still see a way through for Aston Martin if the DBX, priced at about £150,000, delivers the growth investors crave. The SUV, they believe, could broaden Aston Martin’s appeal beyond its association with James Bond, although the latest movie, due in April 2020, will feature the Valhalla hypercar.Yet hanging over their expansion efforts are a multitude of other concerns, for the global economy and the car industry more specifically. Recession fears are rising in major economies, demand is shrinking in China and Europe – and then there’s Brexit.Palmer recently told Autocar magazine that the government’s Brexit strategy had been “laughable”, echoing the exasperation across a global car industry crying out for certainty.Aston Martin’s continued reliance on sales to wealthy Britons means that the worsening outlook for the UK economy – or the threat of disruption to production if imports stutter – looms large over the its prospects for the coming year.“Being overexposed to the UK is probably not a good thing at this stage,” said Jefferies’ Houchois."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4da07c45317728ace6481bc2e9cf61d58ba2743/985_670_2344_1406/master/2344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8325d8cc6590f9f5c6e96996d7fa74ef","title":"its easy to argue for free speech when its not you or your children in the firing line","story":"The ‘right to be a bigot’ ceases to exist without a target. We need to accept hate speech has consequencesWhat did you hear when Adam Goodes was booed? Did you hear racism? Many Australians didn’t, but, to many Indigenous people, the boos were “a howl of humiliation. A howl that echoes across two centuries of invasion, dispossession and suffering.”We can live in the same country and have vastly different responses to the debates and events shaping our lives.Perhaps the differences in what we hear, what we see and what we feel explains the never-ending nature of the debate about freedom of speech, and more specifically hate speech.The debate is overwhelmingly framed, and overcrowded, by voices who start and end the inquiry “from a position of being in the centre”, as Toni Morrison once put it.It is their freedom of speech, their “right to be bigots”, no matter its consequences, that must be prioritised.The people who are not in the centre, however, know this: nothing is free, not even free speech, and the right to be a bigot ceases to exist without a target.The targets of hate speech realise that certain types of speech are a means to administer dehumanising racism and, at its worst, violence. They know “oppressive language does more than represent violence it is violence” (Morrison again). The targets have no choice but to focus attention on the consequences of unlimited speech.They know who pays for the freedom of the commentator boasting on national television about calling blacks niggers. They pay. They pay by the chipping away of their humanity through dehumanising language, they pay when the language of stereotypes cages their children’s dreams and drowns their self-esteem. They pay and they can’t afford to be unaware of the price. The view that “free speech, even that considered offensive or ‘hate speech’, should not be banned – with the obvious and explicit exception of any incitement to violence” as another commentator put it, is incomplete and simplistic.Drawing the limits of speech that should be banned at “incitement to violence” takes a simplistic view of hate speech by treating it as just speech and nothing more. It strips speech of one of its most important features – its ability to change the world (and there are no guarantees that that change will be positive).Arguing for offensive speech to be allowed is easy, and not impressive, when it is not you, your children, and at times your entire race and its right to exist, that is in the firing line.It is easy to hold a moral ground without experiencing its real-world consequences. It is dangerously simplistic to frame “hate speech” as merely about speech and to measure its consequences in terms of hurt feelings only because hate speech negatively impacts the health of its victims, and at its worst it inspires hate crimes.Here lies the danger. The American Academy of Paediatrics warned that racism was harming children’s overall health. It found the “stress of being targeted by, or even just witnessing, racist words and actions can take a lifelong toll on children and adolescents.” The academy concluded that the “evidence to support the continued negative impact of racism on health and wellbeing ... is clear”. Other findings have established that “the emotional pain created by experiences of racism look very similar to the patterns of brain activity caused by physical pain”.When it is not making its victims sick, hateful speech kills.We know hate speech kills because oppressive, racist and hateful language has preceded and accompanied recent hate-based massacres in the United States and New Zealand.The white supremacist terrorists justified their acts using words that would not be misplaced in the mouth of the president of United States, or some mainstream media commentators. A former white nationalist, Christian Picciolini, described words used by the Trump administration as “very similar, if not identical, to the things that we said.”A shared language of hate doesn’t mean a shared intention to kill, but we have seen enough, even in the last few weeks, that it would be careless to frame hateful speech as merely speech. We know there is a link between hate speech and hate crimes.A UK study by a former Scotland Yard counterterrorism officer documented “prima facie and empirical evidence to demonstrate that assailants of Muslims are invariably motivated by a negative view of Muslims they have acquired from either mainstream or extremist nationalist reports or commentaries in the media”.Claims of a connection between hate speech and hate crimes are generally dismissed as exaggerations. If the past is any indication, our reaction should be far more alarmed, or we risk repeating the mistakes authorities are making by underestimating the risk of far-right violence.At the more personal level, if leaders and commentators continued to speak from the centre, they can never get to the heart of our stories, understand our fear, or truly empathise. When your priority is free speech and ours is our lives, you don’t understand we can’t afford to pay for your privilege with our dehumanisations, the first step to opening us up for any evil.What about those who hate? The message is this: you are no less human because you hate me, but your hate is not worth fighting for. There is a place for you in this world, but it can no longer be standing on my back to make yourself taller."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72230d5f2f97fd50e90b7f890b55e768d3f2438a/0_177_1667_1000/master/1667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a14c98091e9dc4fdd0a8d158c533a3e","title":"radio proust in search of lost time","story":"In the age of the short attention-, a 10-hour radio version of In Search of Lost Time is high-class therapyMight Marcel Proust, on finding that BBC Radio 4 is to broadcast a 10-hour adaptation of In Search of Lost Time across the August bank holiday weekend, stretch his dictum that “the real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes”, so that it also includes ears? Or might a 21st-century version of him simply mutter “meh” and start streaming episodes of Euphoria or Glow, while tweeting about something completely different?I’d like to think the former, though Proust, like Isaac Hayes’s Shaft, was a complicated man, and not amenable to second-guessing. Either way, though, the broadcast is good news for devotees of the author and of French literature, and to anyone wary of the often toxic brew of over-excitement, overindulgence and ennui that a long weekend brings. Under a Labour government, which would be committed to even more of the damn things, let’s hope for lengthy adaptations of The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists and Germinal.There is, of course, no mutual exclusion zone around In Search of Lost Time and Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling you are at complete liberty to enjoy both and, in my experience, that’s a good route to at least temporary happiness. But there is something about classic literature, even when it has been adapted by Timberlake Wertenbaker and comes garlanded with performances by Derek Jacobi, Simon Russell Beale and Frances Barber, that sets off the arduousness alarm.Don’t listen to it. It is there to tell you that you, a person with limited time, emotional capacity and cultural bandwidth, could more effectively fill your schedule than by listening to a labyrinthine exploration of consciousness that appears, from what everyone says about it, to be primarily concerned with biscuit-dunking. It is there to insinuate to you that books are hard and telly is easy. It is there to warn you against having notions.The other side of the pincer movement is the purist, who will tell you that listening is not the same as reading, and that 10 hours barely scratches the surface of the modern era’s greatest series of novels. Ignore that advice, too: you should read Proust because it’s a brilliant safari through sex, death and everything in between, but the world won’t end if you don’t. A Proust canapé is better than no Proust at all. Even if you don’t go in search of lost time over the bank holiday, whatever it is you choose to become immersed in, surrender to it. Do not scroll through Twitter at the same time, searching for others’ reactions and speed-forming your own. That way lies a life of apoplectically watching Question Time and raging at the dying of the polite. Do not set about refining your to-do lists or making a start on your taxes. If you are caught up in that other traditional bank holiday pastime, taking a rail-replacement bus, perhaps listen on catchup. There are some activities that can prompt a meditative state conducive to deep listening – ironing sheets is one of them – but they are not as numerous as wild-eyed multi-taskers would have us believe.Proust himself was the ultimate exponent of the art of taking one’s time, because his subject was time what it does to us, how it plays tricks on us and how its passage threatens our belief in an easily verified reality. For much of his life, his chosen location for contemplation was bed his housekeeper once said that she never saw him write even the briefest of notes while standing up, and he preferred above all else to retreat to his cork-lined bedroom.Proust: the prescient enemy of the quantified self, the fleeting gaze, the endlessly active the champion of brooding and naps.

Now get ready to pay the billsHow much will you really spend in your first year at university? Accommodation costs at universities have soared in recent years, while everyday living costs continue to march upwards. As we explore here, rich students are being lured by super-luxe developments charging annual rents of above £20,000. Below we set out what a more typical student may spend on a room, the likely monthly costs for essentials such as food and studying materials – and work out what parents will have to stump up on top of the loans and grants.Rent: Expect to spend about £600 a monthThe typical student will pay around £140 a week for university-supplied accommodation in their first year, so expect to cough up a total of nearly £6,000 for a 40 to 42-week academic year, with London averages closer to £8,000.Unaffordable rents are a greater issue for studentsthan even tuition fees, with the average UK undergraduate expected to pay £147 a week, according to a National Union of Students-Unipol survey. That was for 2018-19, with those starting this year almost certainly paying more. Many fall behind, with 17,000 students in university rent arrears last year.Some official residences now charge more than £20,000 a year. London School of Economics offers studio rooms at its Urbanest building in Lambeth on the south side of the Thames for up to £405 a week. For that, the student gets a 22.1m2 room (about the size of a large living-room) tied into a contract for 50 weeks a year costing £20,223.The cheapest UK location for student accommodation is in Derry, Northern Ireland, where Ulster University charges £75 a week at its Coppin Hall residence, and says it has frozen prices since last year. You get a “spacious study-bedroom, fully equipped with a bed, desk, chair, wardrobe and bedside locker”. Other notably cheap universities for accommodation are Bradford, Huddersfield and Bangor, which all offer private rooms in the £80 to £85 a week bracket.Oxford is curiously cheap. Although the city has some of the UK’s highest house prices, heavily subsidised in-college student accommodation is typically about £4,000 a year, while three meals a day will add a further £1,600.Students (and their parents) are faced with a bewildering number of options at the major metropolitan universities. For instance, Bristol offers 25 options to new undergraduates, ranging from £107 to £167 a week for self-catered units and up to £201 a week (£8,450 a year) for catered rooms.Look out for contract length: for instance the University of East Anglia offers a minimum 38-week licence for a room, whereas York charges for a minimum of 40 weeks and Leeds 42. UEA’s shared twin rooms are great value, if you can stomach living with someone else.Second-year students moving into the private rented sector frequently underestimate other costs such as broadband and water charges, which can add up to £200 a month for a large shared household. Remember, full-time students don’t have to pay council tax. Also factor in that private landlords will require students to pay rent all year, so bills are payable throughout the long summer holiday – even though you may not be there.Many students say the only viable route to tackling rent is to protest. Matthew Lee, a third-year student at UCL in London, says: “In my first year I was in hall, paying around £200 a week. The rent was more than my student loan. The university had very, very little alternative accommodation cheaper than that.“They should be developing cheaper accommodation. Instead, what we’re seeing is old halls demolished and redeveloped into luxury accommodation with massive rent increases.”Lee is part of rent-strike.org, and says protests against UCL rents – such as a rent strike by 1,100 students in 2016 – have won millions in compensation, bursaries and rent cuts. The movement has spread across the UK, with “Cut the rent” campaigns springing up from Aberdeen to Sussex.In a statement, UCL said it “provides some of the most affordable accommodation in central London when compared to equivalent London institutions and the private sector.Living: a typical student will spend £375 a monthThe typical student will spend around £375 a month One the hardest calls for first-timers students – and more likely their parents – is identifying how much they are going to need to get through each month.The website Save the Student recently asked 3,385 students where, after rent, all their money goes – an amount totalling about £376 a month.Students told researchers that they spend just over £20 a week (or £92 a month) on basic food shopping and supermarket-bought booze – plus a further £34 a month on takeaways.The next biggest expense is £50 a month on entertainment – which equates to just £11 a week. Transport costs – getting to and from university at the start and end of term, plus the cost of getting to classes on a daily basis – are surprisingly high, at £44 a month. Household bills and clothes account for about £30 a month, while mobile phone and course materials account both come in at about £17 a month.Once holidays (£24 a month) and gym memberships (£13 a month) are added – plus, according to the survey, an average of £4 a month on illegal drugs – it gives a grand total of £376. This figure disguises the regional variations – clearly students in London will need significantly more spending money than those living in Bangor or Ulster.One of the big ways to reduce spending is to choose accommodation close to where you will be studying. Even bus fares across, say Manchester, will really add up, meaning a more expensive but better-located halls of residence could be cheaper in the long run.A bicycle will save a fortune if you have to cross a city each day. The cost of public transport is another reason to avoid studying in London, especially if the hall of residence is in a outer zone area.Other “hidden” costs to factor in are things like a television licence (£154.50 a year), which you will need if you want to watch live TV or catch-up on iPlayer. Other catch-up services don’t require a licence.Then there’s insurance to cover the cost of your belongings. If you need insurance to cover your belongings while away from home, Moneysupermarket recently said the average cost of contents cover for young people is £63 a year. If you just have an expensive laptop, it may be a better bet to rely on your parent’s home insurance instead.First-year students in halls will avoid gas and electricity and other bills, such as broadband, but generally face higher “going out” costs. But there’s other start-up costs – pots, pans, kettles, duvets, and so on – depending on the accommodation package provided by the university. It’s a good idea to cosy up to grandparents and tell them about the £35 five-pan cookware deal in Asda or the £30 and £80 student starter packs at Ikea.Parents: It’s likely to cost you around £2,000 a yearEvery week Save the Student says it receives emails from parents asking how much they can expect to pay, and the answer for many is: probably more than you were expecting. Only students who come from households that have an income of £25,000 or less will be entitled to receive the full £8,944 a year maintenance loan, which is supposed to cover a student’s living costs – but with rents at £6,000 or more, it rarely does. If the household income is greater than £25,000, the government expects the parents to make a contribution. It is all now means-tested, with the highest earners expected to hand over most.If the parents have a joint household income of £35,000, the student is entitled to a maintenance loan of £7,661, so there is a minimum parental contribution of £1,283 a year. This will give the student a total of £8,944, the minimum the government expects them to receive.Those coming from a £50,000 income household can apply for a maintenance loan of £5,735, with the parents expected to stump up £3,209 a year. Once the household income goes above £62,215, the parent is expected to contribute £4,776 a year.These figures apply in England, and are for those students who are moving away from home, and studying outside London. Those heading to the capital can borrow up to £11,672 a year – which is again means-tested, and requires similar parental contributions.The problem is that for many students, the total of just under £9,000 a year is not going to cover their basic living costs. Students are typically left with a £3,000 shortfall, so their parents will either have to cover it, or the student has to work or borrow the rest.Save the Student says in its 2018 survey, students reported receiving an average of £138 a month from parents. But a frequent complaint is that they just don’t get sufficient parental contributions. The way the scheme is administered penalises those with large families who might have more than one student studying at any one time, as this is not taken into account.On the flipside, some parents do not want their student offspring to be racking up such big debts, and will contribute far more than the required amount.It’s worth noting that household income calculation are often gamed. Divorced couples frequently choose to house their student son or daughter with the parent on the lowest income – meaning they receive a higher government-backed loan. If you are planning to retire, you might want to bring it forward, particularly if you have more than one child heading to university.To work out your expected contribution, go to the official student finance calculator for England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6eab52b12c97551ee5c2b01daa48adfde035a84/0_4_3920_2352/master/3920.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=ee406cc81ba3b0aa726d2e9dd8ffadd8","title":"edinburgh limits pupil climate strike approval to once a year","story":"Activists vow to keep on after council votes to authorise only one day’s school absenceYoung activists have vowed to keep protesting in Edinburgh despite the city council saying it will only authorise pupils to miss school once a year to attend climate strikes.Pupils have been attending protests on Fridays outside the Scottish parliament on an ad hoc basis after the council granted permission in March.On Friday, however, the council’s education, children and families committee approved a motion by the Scottish National party-Labour coalition to limit authorised absences to one day. Activists had asked the council to support pupil participation in the continuing global movement started by 16-year-old Greta Thunberg.The council insisted it would not punish children for taking part in subsequent strikes but it said parental consent would be required.Edinburgh’s education convener, Ian Perry, said: “We support the young people making their voices heard regarding climate change as it is one of the most important issues that’s facing the world. However, there needs to be a balance struck and if we allow pupils more than one absence the issue is that they could be regularly missing school which affects their education.”Sandy Boyd, a member of Scottish Youth Climate Strike, said the decision was disappointing but added: “I’m still confident that our movement won’t be deterred by it.

The 37-year-old German managed only one victory from his 19 games in charge.Siewert took over in January after David Wagner left the club but could not prevent their relegation from the Premier League.His only win was a 1-0 victory over Wolves in his fifth game at the helm as Huddersfield finished bottom, relegated by March.A club statement read: “Huddersfield Town has this evening terminated the contract of head coach Jan Siewert with immediate effect.”Huddersfield’s poor form continued into this season, with the club having picked up a single point from their opening three Championship games. They were also knocked out of the Carabao Cup at home to League One Lincoln.Huddersfield’s statement added: “Siewert joined the club from Borussia Dortmund in January 2019 in the club’s ultimately unsuccessful fight against relegation from the Premier League and led the team in the first four competitive games of the new season, with his final game in charge being the Sky Bet Championship defeat to Fulham on Friday evening.“No further comment will be made this evening.”Ivan Cavaleiro’s stunning curler for Fulham 10 minutes from time proved the final straw for the Huddersfield hierarchy after Karlan Grant’s third goal of the season had cancelled out Aleksandar Mitrovic’s opener early in the second half.

True, back in the autumn of 2016, he had also inflicted the first defeat to be endured by Guardiola since his arrival in English football.There was also no escaping the reality that, before their trip to the Etihad Stadium, Tottenham are the only side to have defeated Manchester City since the end of January, courtesy of Heung-min Son’s goal in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final in early April. The champions are not due to meet another member of last season’s elite six until a collision with Liverpool in November, so it is easy to see why the rest of the ision might be pinning their hopes on Pochettino conjuring a way to stall City’s progress.If Pochettino’s masterplan is wrecked on Saturday, it is conceivable City’s winning streak may have extended to a record 25 league games by the time they arrive at Anfield.So it is all on the Argentinian.“The best way to see who is ‘the best’ would be to put these ‘brave managers’ in a ring and fight, like Anthony Joshua.“I look so brave on the touchline because I know that is never going to happen, so I shout and everything. That is the point: I love to compare my team with another team.“Tottenham was the last team to beat Manchester City, for sure. If you play an opponent, you care about their skills and analyse their strengths and weaknesses to find a way to beat them, but we have a philosophy.“We have a way we love to play. We are brave, we try to move forward, we try to think about us before we think about the opponent. I don’t know if that is the key to sometimes beating a team like Manchester City.”That willingness to be bold and take the game to the champions, where others shrink and vainly attempt to smother with blanket defence, would appear to be one explanation for Spurs’ relatively encouraging record in these fixtures.The tactic is risky. Pochettino has endured resounding defeats to City in the past few years, too, and there are few teams who can resist when they click fully into rhythm.Yet his own team’s forte remains its fluent creativity and bite up front. They scored three in the second leg at the Etihad Stadium to prevail, after that excruciating VAR check, on away goals even without the injured Harry Kane.A few days later, they counted themselves unlucky to have succumbed to Phil Foden’s early winner having created presentable opportunities in a lower-key Premier League rematch at the same venue.They will be blunted slightly this time round by the absence of the suspended Son and with Dele Alli only recently returned to training outside after hamstring trouble. Then there is the dilemma currently posed by Christian Eriksen. The midfielder, now into the last year of his contract and unlikely to agree new terms having set his heart upon a new challenge, began last Saturday on the bench, but Aston Villa were only prised apart once he had been summoned on after the break. Tottenham duly created twice as many chances during his 26-minute cameo than they had managed without the playmaker.Pochettino insisted the 27-year-old’s contractual status is neither here nor there when it comes to first-team involvement and the Denmark international could begin on Saturday. But the prospect of Eriksen – or even Danny Rose, who had been omitted from a pre-season tour of Asia “to explore prospective opportunities with other clubs” – still being lured away before the closure of the transfer window in rival European leagues is clearly disconcerting.The hope was all business, in and out, would have long since been concluded. The manager, at present, cannot properly plan for a campaign that is already upon him.“Like we can change our minds, a player can change his. So, until then, it is difficult to say whether this will be the ‘bravest’ group of players I’ve had here.“The team is not settled how I expected it to be. We are still working on trying to make sure it is finished come 2 September.“That will be the moment to have a big conversation with the whole squad and settle the principle. Until then, things can still happen and it is not in my hands. We need to wait and hope there are not too many changes or not too many problems for us.”City, seeking a 16th league win in a row, will pose issues of a more immediate kind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/871c29e4862071f12dd88f5ae73fdd028efa8313/22_10_5271_3163/master/5271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af442fdcd06819c59fedef8632cf09a9","title":"a letter to my father activism inspired my own","story":"‘You weren’t always the greatest dad, but you were a first-class human being’: the letter you always wanted to writeYou weren’t always the greatest dad.

You will find sports masseurs making snide jokes about candles and whale music, and regular masseurs reminding the world that you don’t need to wear Lycra to understand anatomy. It wasn’t until I spoke to Kate Kahle, a sports massage therapist for 25 years, that I really understood. “Sports massage usually just targets a specific issue,” she said. “A regular massage will be the whole body. So a client might come in with shoulder problems, and as well as looking at the part that’s hurting, I look for the connections too.” In other words: regular massage makes you feel relaxed sports massage stops things hurting.I have never been interested in massage: I’ve always taken the opportunity to go immediately to sleep, missed the fabled benefits, then jolted into consciousness at 50 minutes, startled and a bit ashamed, wondering what he or she had to do to wake me up.Then I hurt my neck, and had a sports massage from someone a friend recommended. It was an experience that cleared up the mystery of why, when you ask someone if they know an acupuncturist, for example, they’ll say, “I went to a brilliant guy, once, but he did puncture someone’s lung and I can’t remember his name,” whereas when you cast around for a sports massage therapist, people fall to their knees. The person they know is an angel a miracle worker. Plainly, if there’s one thing people really like, it’s when things stop hurting.“Every massage therapist has to have a basic anatomy and physiology qualification,” Kahle explains, “but when you’re trying to solve problems, you have to know how everything connects, where the attachment points are, how the circulatory system works.”Muscles like to be stretched tendons and ligaments, not so much. A good therapist can feel something deeper than tightness or tension they can feel your heat in their fingers. “There will be increased blood circulation to injured areas,” says Kahle. “That’s the body’s way of saying there’s a problem.”Wherever that problem is, it most likely either didn’t start there or will lead to something worse: that’s part of the talismanic property of the massage therapist – locating the source of the damage. It turns out that if your neck is killing you and you can’t even remember using it for sport, it might not even have been sport that did the damage it could just as well be related to your sedentary lifestyle, to the way you cradle a phone between your ear and shoulder, to the ricocheting impact of one muscle’s tension upon another’s recovery.In truth, I’ve been putting my neck out now and then for 20 years. I’ve tried everything: acupuncture, osteopathy, even asking the GP. Everything helps eventually, but nothing works as fast as this. I felt basically cured in one session. .Regular massage can help maintain flexibility as you age by increasing blood flow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa7320506c0a41d5d973c85992429ab9caf4f3ee/13_0_1213_728/master/1213.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e74dd6d39d56b35c6fce4dfaf8a3a11a","title":"take on my kids fortnite romesh ranganathan","story":"Mastering Fortnite would make me the coolest dad, but I can’t even work out the controlsThe game Fortnite has just started its 10th season, and my children have become impossible to understand. They say things like: “There’s been a drop near the eye of the storm,” and “This guy using the Twistie skin is such a blatant noob.” They also seem to think my wife and I have some sort of contact with the makers of the game, as this morning my second son asked me if I could sort out the Fortnite servers. I said I would, and left the room to make a sandwich. When I returned, the servers had been fixed and my son thanked me. I accepted his gratitude, as my level of understanding is so minimal that for all I know all it needed was for me to make a sandwich.I have never worried about having my finger on the pulse, because I consume music and cinema voraciously, and assumed that meant I would know all of the things my kids were into, even if I didn’t like them. The other day I said to my son: “I’m taking ya missus, nah brother I’m joking,” because that is a song by Jay1, who I know kids love, and my son told me that a) that might have been impressive if I had done it four months ago, and b) what I was doing was obvious and pathetic. But I find Fortnite completely impenetrable, and I now have to listen to my kids talk about great Fortnite players with more affection than they do their parents. I constantly walk past their rooms to the sounds of, “Aw man Ninja 120 is the absolute best”, or “Alpha Bum posted up a video of him killing 12 enemies with just a crossbow!” I can feel the common ground between us disappearing.My kids are very different to how I remember being at their age with regards to interests. They are really keen for my wife and me to be across all this crap. I went into my eldest son’s room when he was in the middle of a game and asked him to talk me through it. He proceeded to give me an in-depth tutorial that consisted of him running around, building weird structures and shooting people, while asking me if I was getting it. I really wasn’t. And what’s frustrating is I’m a gamer, albeit a casual one. I’ll play anything Mario- or Zelda-related, but Fortnite is one step beyond me. I don’t get anything from it but motion sickness and an increased sense of anxiety about how violent future generations are going to be.He went on to YouTube and started showing me videos posted by the best players in the world, the likes of whom recently won shedloads of money in the Fortnite World Cup. I watched these videos of people running about shooting and drinking potion, and every now and again my son would say: “How sick was that move?” and I would nod while wondering how much longer I would have to watch before I could ask to stop, without hurting his feelings. I guess this is what it felt like when an earlier generation of kids started getting into punk or hip-hop. But that happened to teenagers. My kids aren’t even 10 yet.I am going to have to find a way into Fortnite. But I am now of the belief that this has to become an undercover mission, so that I can become good at it without looking like I’m trying. I am going to access it at work, train, and become incredible. Then I am going to enter one of their battles as DaddyKnowsBest and lay waste to them and their friends. I will unmask myself and wait for their adulation as they realise that I am the coolest dad in the country.The truth is, however, that I had a go the other night after they had gone to sleep and I couldn’t even figure out the bloody controls.

It wasn’t for a lack of trying. I was born with cerebral palsy and while I try not to let it get in the way of achieving my goals and aspirations, finding another role has not been easy.I do feel that having a disability is a barrier to getting a job. I’ve applied for numerous positions over the years and it’s been rejection after rejection. It’s been very difficult to deal with, but I never gave up. Saying that, I haven’t sat idle – I’ve been volunteering for Disability Horizons, an online disability lifestyle magazine, for the past seven years.In June I was so happy to have started a part-time job, working 17 hours a week spread over three days. My salary is £23,000. I’m enjoying it and slowly getting back into the routine of going into an office. My role involves assisting colleagues with organising and planning events, ensuring that all the logistics are in place.I have a real passion for events and have experience, voluntary and paid, planning and organising events such as fashion shows, coffee mornings, parties, meetings and conferences.I’m in the process of setting up a company that works with businesses to make events more inclusive for disabled people. Attending them has made me realise that not all businesses know how to cater for everyone.Last year I attended a fashion show which had really long queues to get in and when I did get in, there was no accessible seating for wheelchair users. Organisers need to ensure disabled people don’t have to queue for a long period they should be given priority access.This year I’m planning to launch Access My Events to give disabled people the opportunity to enjoy events. I’ve wanted to set up a business for a long time but faced hurdles to get to where I want to be.I live with my parents and three sisters and one brother in Shepherd’s Bush in London. To be honest, my parents do everything for us all, but I do contribute about £80 a month to rent. I regularly go to an all-ability cycling club, which is free, and I attend a local gym that runs free activities for disabled people.Due to my disability I have to take a taxi to work and back, which costs about £25 each way. Usually this would be funded through Access to Work (a government programme aimed at supporting disabled people to take up or remain in work) but at the moment I’m having issues getting the funding as I wish to use a particular cab firm that I use regularly. I am having to pay out of my own pocket until funding is approved. Sometimes I have to spend money on cabs separate to work. It can cost anything between £15–£20 depending on where I am travelling to.I love holidays. Earlier this year I went on a pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia and then on to Pakistan to visit family with my parents. It set me back about £600, plus other expenses. I also love technology exhibitions as I’m really into tech.Exhibitions tend to be expensive, but if there is anything I like I make a note of it and purchase it from a store for cheaper.It feels great to be earning after a very long time and having that independence. Although I don’t look too far into the future, I would love my own place that’s adapted to my needs and where I can be as independent as possible. That would be really nice.Career-wise, I’d like to focus on my company and grow a network of businesses to work with. I’m keen to make inclusivity a staple part of organising an event. I want to work to make a difference for other disabled people through my work, both paid and voluntary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29ab5fd06598e0ba33ab8276221742f3866bf485/0_326_4776_2866/master/4776.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a032b5d9cc8280b9024f37dd527a3d5","title":"woodstock 50th anniversary memories looking back","story":"The influential, star-packed 1969 festival is remembered by those who organised, photographed and performed “Woodstock was a just few hours in my 60-plus-year-long career,” says Leo Lyons, the bassist for blues rock band Ten Years After, who performed on the final day of the festival in the summer of 1969. “But I suppose my epitaph will no doubt read: ‘Musician who played at Woodstock.’”It’s a sentiment that’s widely shared by the countless characters who populated the three-day festival famously devoted to peace and love, from the half a million hippie spectators to the musicians, organizers and workers who all converged for not only one of the most important events in music, but American culture in general. It’s a renowned status that has gained new attention timed to the festival’s half-century anniversary with countless retrospectives, documentaries and anniversary events, whether happening or attempted. “The amount of press this anniversary is generating is beyond anything I’ve seen before,” notes Michael Lang, who co-created the 1969 festival along with Artie Kornfeld, John P Roberts and Joel Rosenman. “I think it gave everybody an example of how things could be.”How exactly a ragtag group of disparate iniduals converged to create a cultural movement has been a much-told story that 50 years later verges on cliche. “Woodstock and the 60s in general has been mythologized to the point of kids dressing up as hippies for Halloween,” explains John Kane, a scholar of the festival who wrote the book Pilgrims of Woodstock as well as the upcoming The Last Seat in the House: The Story of Hanley Sound, which focuses on the festival’s sound director, Bill Hanley. “When something becomes too much of the norm, it becomes meaningless. These people were part of a counterculture and denounced dystopian ideals and societal norms. Everybody who went says it was a transformational experience. Some people left and went back to work while others left to join a commune. The question that gets asked a lot is, how and why did it happen that way? In many ways, it was a miracle.”Two weeks before its 15 August kickoff, Diltz was on the ground in Bethel, New York, with a hundred rolls of black and white and color film at the cow farm owned by Max Yasgur, then a conservative 49-year-old small town dairyman whom Lang and his crew convinced to let them use his property. “I remember watching them build this big wooden stage at the bottom of this green hill of waving alfalfa,” says Diltz of the laid-back vibes before the crowds descended. “We’d go skinny dipping in the lake and it was like summer camp sunshine and beautiful afternoons. I was preoccupied photographing everything I looked at.” That peace soon turned to chaos when hundreds of thousands more spectators than expected began to converge on Bethel, causing extreme traffic jams. Lang soon realized that even the basic idea of charging people for entry was a pipe dream. “I realized it was going to be free for everyone when our ticket booths never got put in place,” he remembers. “There were ideas about maybe passing a basket around, but so many people were coming and it we didn’t want it to become an issue.” (Despite its popularity, the festival actually became a money-losing operation as a result, not turning a profit until years later.)“I had not watched much TV aside from the moon landing, so the first time I heard about the size of the audience was from our US manager on our journey from the airport to Bethel,” remembers Lyons, whose band, Ten Years After, was a popular British act before Woodstock became their American breakthrough. “We arrived just in time to catch Joe Cocker’s set and it was quite a spectacle. The organization was hard pressed, and I saw none of the usual backstage facilities.” One memory that’s vivid in Lyons’ mind was a downpour that inundated the property. “There was nothing anyone could do but wait for it to stop. The stage was slipping down the slope and I heard it had moved 8ft. I think the organizers by this time had come to realize the extent of the potential problems.”When it came to the actual performances, the lineup contained some of the biggest names of the day, from Sly and the Family Stone to the protest folk hero Arlo Guthrie and the blues icon Janis Joplin. Santana and John Sebastian both famously performed while tripping on drugs, while the Grateful Dead had to cut their set short when their amps overloaded. When Lyons hit the stage, bass in hand, he describes a treacherous scene. “It was crisscrossed with cables, in between were rivers of water left by the storm. We considered that we might be electrocuted and joked that if one of us died we’d sell a lot of records.” At one point, his band had to start one song three times to tune their guitars due to the oppressive humidity. “But the audience remained patient and the energy was electric. Despite our problems we made a connection.”When it came time for Gross and Sha Na Na to hit the stage, the proceedings were so delayed that they didn’t perform until 7.30am that Monday. “I hadn’t slept in a day and a half and had been drinking and whatever else people were doing back then. We kept getting pushed back, so by the time I went on stage we were exhausted. Somebody decided to count very fast tempos, which was a terrific idea.” Once Sha Na Na left the stage, Hendrix closed out the proceedings. Diltz says he was about 20ft to Hendrix’s right, camera in hand. “Jimi and his band walked out when dawn had broken and it was quite a sight. Hendrix was obviously amazing, but everything stopped when he played the national anthem. It was surprising and at first I said: ‘Why’s he doing that? That’s the government’s song and with Vietnam, it represents everything we’re against.’ But a minute later I realized he was taking it back, for us. It felt like we were the Sioux nation filling the valley before they went after Custer. We never knew there was so many of us.” Once everyone left, Diltz remembers that lush green field he enjoyed the week before now looked very different. “It was a muddy mess of soggy sleeping bags and blankets. It reminded me of one of those Mathew Brady civil war photographs.”Just a year later, both Joplin and Hendrix would be dead and soon the hippie lifestyle would dissipate. But the impact of Woodstock still permeates to this day, whether through the ideas they presented, the stars it made and the legacy it left behind. “In my view, Woodstock 69 should have never gotten off the ground because of the production calamities,” says Kane of its continuing impact. “Think about the last concert you went to. It’s so structured you can’t even stand on your seat to get a better view. Anything with a crowd is looked at differently now.” Gross, meanwhile, looks back on Woodstock with equal parts annoyance and praise. After all, Sha Na Na’s performance check bounced and they were paid a pittance to be featured in the subsequent blockbuster documentary. “Obviously there was great music played by great artists and that’s what people celebrate. But it’s like the country song The Older I Get, The Better I Was,” he says with a laugh. “Every time I speak the truth to this, I’ll get 100 tweets that I’m a bitter old man. It’s very hard to be honest about this. There were good things and very bad things that came from many dimensions of what happened there.” For Diltz, whose photographs of the festival make up the aptly titled new book Woodstock: 3 Days That Lasted 50 Years (some of which are on display now at the Morrison hotel gallery in New York and Los Angeles) notes that it has become a bigger milestone as more time has gone by. “At the time, you’re never thinking how will this compare 25 years from now or 50 years from now. It was a sensual experience to be there, but it wasn’t historic.”While celebrations are set at the original site this weekend, Lang hints that his own hopes for a 50th anniversary event haven’t died just yet. “It’s a possibility that we do something closer to the election. That’s something we’re thinking about.” It’s an ongoing project that, like many things, stems from that fateful weekend in 1969. “I think people own Woodstock themselves, as its become something that’s a part of everybody’s life. It represented a moment of hope on the planet. I think that’s why it resonates even 50 years later in such a huge way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc3f7713168debe29af6eaf0cbb7a871d73cc412/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=72e3d369c9b2446bb18b30113db0d73f 1400w","title":"labour to give councils power to seize boarded up shops","story":"Abandoned buildings could be turned into community centres in push to revive high streetsLabour will allow councils to seize abandoned shops to give them a new lease of life as cooperatives or community centres, a policy designed to revive struggling high streets.Jeremy Corbyn is expected to announce the shake-up on a visit to a high street in Bolton on Saturday, calling the sight of boarded-up shops a “symptom of economic decay” which is lowering living standards.Under the Labour proposals, local authorities could offer properties which had been vacant for 12 months to startups, cooperative businesses and community projects.“Boarded-up shops are a symptom of economic decay under the Conservatives and a sorry symbol of the malign neglect so many communities have suffered,” Corbyn will say.“Once-thriving high streets are becoming ghost streets. Labour has a radical plan to revive Britain’s struggling high streets by turning the blight of empty shops into the heart of the high street, with thousands of new businesses and projects getting the chance to fulfil their potential.”Initiatives to regenerate high streets were a key policy pledge at Labour’s party conference and are understood to be a significant part of the party’s strategy in less-affluent towns, particularly those in the Midlands and north-east targeted by the Conservatives after the Brexit vote.The party’s five-point plan for reviving the high street includes banning ATM charges and action to dissuade bank branch and post office closures, as well as free bus travel for under-25s and a review of the business rates system.The shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne, said: “Under this government, our high streets have suffered a retail apocalypse. High-street closures are at a historic high, leaving too many of our once thriving towns abandoned and awash with boarded-up shop fronts.“Labour’s radical plan will turn around the mess that the Tories have created and will give local authorities the power to make our high streets the pride of our communities that they once were.”Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said more action needed to be taken to stop shops from closing down, rather than just repurposing abandoned buildings.“Small businesses on our high streets are under pressure like never before, with costs rising, employment burdens weighing heavy and political uncertainty – and rows of boarded-up shops do not make for a healthy or inspiring town centre,” he said.“While finding new ways to reopen closed shops is positive, this is after the fact they have shut. Sustainable, erse and thriving high streets rest on good local investment to make the public realm more attractive, and stopping rents and rates bills becoming unaffordable for businesses in the first place.”The communities minister, Jake Berry, dismissed the proposal, alleging that Labour’s tax policies would cause more businesses to leave high streets. “Jeremy Corbyn would wreck the economy, tax small businesses and scare off the investment needed to help our high streets, meaning more boarded-up shops and fewer jobs,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ca98b7e340a28ba9da02b97c84181845ffb2b6/483_0_3454_2073/master/3454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8a28f18489f7159273c0b0968afd9cf","title":"sajid javid refuses to rule out stamp duty reversal so seller pays","story":"‘I’m a low-tax guy’ says chancellor as he reveals he is considering policy changes The chancellor has refused to rule out reversing stamp duty so it is paid by the seller, rather than the buyer.In an interview with the Times, Sajid Javid indicated he was willing to consider the policy, which was said to have been favoured by Boris Johnson during the Tory leadership campaign, among others.Asked about the proposal, Javid told the paper: “I’m looking at various options.

In mathematics, it’s a bolt-on at best. It has to be there from day one and at the forefront of your mind in every step you take.”Fry will explore the power and perils of modern mathematics in December when she delivers the 2019 Royal Institution Christmas lectures. Made popular by figures from Michael Faraday to Carl Sagan, the demonstration-filled sessions were launched in 1825 and became the most prestigious public science lectures in Britain.In the three-lecture series, Secrets and Lies: the Hidden Power of Mathematics, Fry will examine the maths of risk and luck, from finding the perfect partner to keeping healthy and happy. She will also explore how algorithms that feast on data have infiltrated every aspect of our lives what problems maths should be kept away from and how we must learn when the numbers cannot be trusted.Fry said she got a sense of the ethical blindspots scientists can have while describing to an academic conference in Berlin the computer modelling of the 2011 riots she had done for the politan police. The audience, which understood the realities of a police state, heckled her from their seats.When Fry returned to London, she realised how mathematicians, computer engineers and physicists are so used to working on abstract problems that they rarely stop to consider the ethics of how their work might be used.The issue has become urgent now that researchers are building systems that gather and sell personal data, exploit human frailties, and take on life-or-death decisions. “We’ve got all these tech companies filled with very young, very inexperienced, often white boys who have lived in maths departments and computer science departments,” Fry said.“They have never been asked to think about ethics, they have never been asked to consider how other people’s perspectives of life might be different to theirs, and ultimately these are the people who are designing the future for all of us.”The case for a Hippocratic oath for scientists has been made before, including by the philosopher Karl Popper, who wrote in 1969: “One of the few things we can do is to try to keep alive, in all scientists, the consciousness of their responsibility.” Thirty years later, Sir Joseph Rotblat, who quit the allied nuclear bomb project for moral reasons, endorsed a pledge written by the US student Pugwash group.On algorithms, Fry said she was not against them but wanted to drive home their limitations. She cited the case of the classic textbook The Making of a Fly, by the British biologist Peter Lawrence. At one point, Amazon was offering the book for $23m thanks to a war between sellers’ algorithms which had got out of control. In other circumstances, such a clash might not be so amusing.The mathematician, who has deleted her Facebook account and uses false names and email addresses online, said she also believed the public must take some responsibility for the products tech firms served up.“We’re getting the technology we’re asking for. And as part of that it’s really important that we have a national conversation about what it is we actually want. Because it’s very easy to make these decisions without full visibility of everything you are agreeing to.”The genetics testing firm 23andMe was a case in point, she said.“We literally hand over our most private data, our DNA, but we’re not just consenting for ourselves, we are consenting for our children, and our children’s children. Maybe we don’t live in a world where people are genetically discriminated against now, but who’s to say in 100 years that we won’t? And we are are paying to add our DNA to that dataset.”The answer, she said, was to arm people with knowledge. “The future doesn’t just happen. We are building it, and we are building it all the time. The national conversation, what people are saying in the media, what people are talking about on Twitter and on Instagram, I do believe that makes a difference.”The lectures, to be broadcast on BBC Four, will be only the fourth in nearly 200 years to focus on mathematics. “One of the problems maths struggles with is that it’s invisible,” Fry said. We haven’t got explosions on our side. But despite being invisible, mathematics has a dramatic impact on our lives, and at this point in history that’s more pertinent than it’s ever been.”Tickets for the live filming of the 2019 Christmas lectures will be available to RIGB members, patrons and UK registered schools via a ballot opening on 5 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

Steve Smith was in again.This series is going to ebb and flow with Smith’s form. If he carries on batting like he did in that first Test at Edgbaston, then the tide is only going one way.Jofra Archer is England’s first, best, freshest hope of fixing him and he was ready and waiting at the end of his run, weight all on his right foot. He tossed the ball from one hand to the other and smiled to himself as Smith scratched and fiddled and worried and twiddled and took his guard. Archer has all the self-confidence of a young man who has not yet met a batsmen he could not beat for pace.Archer had just taken the first of his many Test wickets, Cameron Bancroft, beaten with a delivery that nipped back in past his dangling bat and hit him high on the back pad. It had been coming, although it had taken longer than he would have liked. He was five overs into a spell, and five balls into an over, which he closed out by firing a short and straight welcome delivery just wide of Smith’s off stump.It came through at 93.5mph. Smith dragged his bat back down away from it like he had been scalded by the heat of it as it flew through.The same people who had booed Smith cooed in admiration of Archer. His second delivery was shorter and straighter, angled in towards Smith’s hip. He flicked it down to fine leg for a single.That left Travis Head on strike. He looked vulnerable. Archer whipped through two deliveries that bit on the pitch and broke off the seam, past his outside edge. Then followed up with a wild bouncer that shot through so high that Jonny Bairstow had to leap off his feet to fetch it down again.Archer was enjoying himself and shot Head a happy grin. It was not reciprocated. Archer had bowled six overs in a row, though, and you could feel Joe Root wrestling with whether or not to keep him on for another one. There was a foreshadowing here of a problem Archer is going to face throughout his career. England will always want more from him in Test, one-day and Twenty20 cricket. Root could not resist the temptation, not while he had two new batsmen in. They looked jittery, too. Smith always starts like a kid who has eaten too many sweets and twice changed his mind after starting off on quick singles.Which meant Head was stuck up Archer’s end. He was bowling fuller now, homing in on the left-hander’s off stump. Head groped blindly at the ball, in a fuddle about whether to play forward or back.Chris Woakes, meanwhile, was hanging the ball out beyond Smith’s reach. England have obviously decided that they made the mistake of playing to his strengths by bowling too straight at him at Edgbaston. Here, there were two deliveries in the first 30 he faced that would have hit the stumps. The flip side was that a lot of them were so wide that Smith was able to leave 15 of the rest of them well alone.It gave Smith a chance to run through his entire repertoire of eccentric leaves, presenting a cricketer’s tribute to the great choreographers of modern dance. There was a Bob Fosse flick and a Martha Graham arabesque and a Twyla Tharp pirouette.Woakes, as if in irritation at all these ridiculous antics, decided to try to knock his head off by banging one in back of a length. Smith stood up and swatted it disdainfully away through square‑leg for four, a swift, crisp and ominous assertion of authority that suggested the precarious moment had passed and England had missed their chance.The bouncer would have been better coming from Archer but he was finally pulled out of the attack after seven overs in a row, three maidens, eight runs and the one wicket.England would have loved to have gone out for one last blast later in the day but did not get the chance. There was a break in the rain around five o’clock but it did not last long enough for the groundsmen to take the covers off. Instead, they will start it all over again in the morning, round two in a contest that is likely to define the rest of the series."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4552648945364c7923509dc5e61727b93d1689e/0_26_3629_2177/master/3629.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d89825ff2dde7e0a8750d88cb18e68c3","title":"grasski world championships in pictures","story":"For those who have always fancied giving skiing a go but live in a place where it never snows, grass skiing might be the answer and the Grasski World Championship might be the inspiration you need"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d78c9820f7887e5906f7ee020bc9b7c0626b915/357_90_2648_1589/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e7cb6a536122df55d4bbb302eb51be","title":"when chase is on his computer he feels like any other nine year old","story":"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsyIt’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home. While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business with The Deaf Traveller, and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

So when the comic got the opportunity to write and star in his own sitcom, it seemed obvious where to set it …“Part of the challenge from the beginning was: how can I make this bad idea good? I don’t like the idea of a sitcom about a lettings agency, I really don’t. But then I once made a short about a guy turning into a car, and I think that’s the worst idea ever. But I also think, what’s more impressive than a really good idea done well? A really bad idea done well.”Demetriou’s logic, if you can call it that, has somehow paid off. The show – which reviewers compared to The Office, although it also has flecks of the surrealist comradery of ensemble shows such as It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia – was nominated for two Baftas and recommissioned for a second season, which airs this week.He is right that it really shouldn’t work. The titular Stath is the kind of character who is normally the bit-part villain in someone else’s TV show: he’s a benefactor of nepotism with a massively inflated sense of his own abilities, doing one of the most loathed jobs there is. Yet Demetriou has crafted a hilarious and empathetic lead who speaks in almost his own language, a creole of north London slang, Greek idioms and the patois of ineptitude.Stath is joined at Michael \u0026amp Eagle Lettings by a boiler room of flawed colleagues and his sister Sophie (played by Jamie’s real-life sister, comedian Natasia Demetriou).“The world of lettings just lends itself to character comedy,” says Katy Wix, who plays Carole, the office swot who struts around like an Apprentice contestant. “Lettings agents are just really on, they have this fake chumminess with the clients, the whole set-up of viewing lends itself to these characters revealing what idiots they are.”I meet the cast a few days after they have wrapped filming. Jamie is in a button-down shirt and trendy baseball cap. After the first series aired, I’d read interviews in which he says he’s nothing like Stath. But on first impressions, I’m not so sure.“How’s it going … was my hand wet from the toilet?” he says absent-mindedly, before answering his own question without pausing, “Mmm, enough that I should have warned you beforehand.”Not to worry, I say. How are you?“I’m quite nice. Yeah. I pulled a muscle in my neck so I can’t turn my neck one way. Imagine now if I did the interview and I was just moving my neck around – you’d be like: that’s a very specific lie.” It’s the kind of stream of consciousness that you could easily imagine Stath spouting as he shows a couple around a two-bed in Enfield.Season two is focused on gentrification, and Stath being lost in a world of millennials and hipsters. Julian, played by Dustin Demri-Burns, who ran the Foxtons-like posho estate agents next door, has become Stath’s boss. “He’s made the office look ridiculous,” says Wix. “He wants it to look like an Apple store, and the contrast of that and the inadequacy of the people who work there is perfect.”In this world of idiots and phonies, the relationship between Sophie and Al (played by Al Roberts), the bashful agent who commutes via coach from Birmingham each morning because he can’t get a flat in London, gives the show its heart. They have a kind of remedial will-they-won’t-they flirting via lobbing bits of rubble around. Natasia explains that it’s not an entirely invented dalliance.We also see more of Katia, Sophie’s equally talentless buddy from dance college, who’s played by Natasia’s comedy partner Ellie White. “We’re all really obsessed with the fail auditions on early series of Popstars and Pop Idol – people talking back to the judges when they get rejected, like: ‘Actually, you’re in the wrong,’” says White. “I think Katia and Sophie have the same sense of delusion as they try to become dancers.”Natasia says the characters are partly based on the way she acts slightly braindead when she’s visiting her parents. I wonder if playing the character makes that worse – do they ever find themselves slipping into Stath and Sophie at the family dinner table? “It happened when we went on holiday to Greece together, a really romantic holiday, just the two of us,” she explains. “Jamie swam out to a little island quite far away and I went over and said: ‘I’ve come to rescue you Stathy,’ pretending to be a pirate. I think that’s what Sophie would do.”Fans of realism could easily be put off Stath by its pilot episode: there’s a lot of physical comedy and not many obvious gags. But as the first series develops, it becomes quite wonderfully surreal, a world that is both mundane and too stupid to exist. At a time when television is fixated on memoirish sadcoms about loss and betrayal, Stath harks back to the golden era of 90s surrealist comedies such as The Fast Show and I’m Alan Partridge, where society was satirised through exaggeration. You can imagine if Partridge had got into lettings rather than local radio, he may well have ended up working at Michael \u0026amp Eagle.Jamie wrote some of the first series with Robert Popper, who created Friday Night Dinner. But whereas that show always hinted at rather than explored its Jewish setting, Jamie really leans into the character’s Greek and Cypriot heritage. “That’s a voice that’s specific to me and Tash,” says Jamie. “I don’t know about lettings agencies, but I do know about this culture – its thought processes and warmth. I know about the goodness and funniness. Growing up in England I’ve leant more on my English side, but Stath is what would have happened if I leant more on my Greek side.”“In this series, you see that very Greek thing where people will just rock up at anyone’s house and they’ll let you in,” says Natasia. “That is what our dad does and there’s something so funny about when you do that in England because here there’s a culture when it’s very polite, you book in advance, you pencil in a date. But when we were younger we’d be watching TV on the weekend and then all of a sudden three Greek men show up and just sit in our front room.”Is there ever concern from the Greek community about Stath, one of the few out-and-proud Greeks in British scripted television, being such a moron?“You hear an occasional thing about the older generation thinking the show is too mocking. But what would they rather? If My Big Fat Greek Wedding was all about a family of the most respectable members of the Greek community, talking normally to each other, it would be the most boring thing in the world. It’s a comedy. I think it’s a celebration of Greekness.”In the first season, the lettings agency was a family concern and Stath was given a free ride by his dad. Season two brings jeopardy with Julian now threatening to kick Stath out the business.“He just wants to slick the place up. I used to work on Homes Under the Hammer, and the estate agents on that would always have the same walk, with the clipboard and suit,” says Burns. “This skinny-suit-wearing, no socks-in-the-summer, wheeler-dealery tribe. It’s a very funny target.”Julian has also latched on to Dean, played by Kiell Smith-Bynoe, to try to be his No 2, forcing him to appear in a bizarre promotional video-turned-erotic fiction. “I’ve had more to do and there’s just non-stop gags on set,” says Smith-Bynoe. “I want to be around even for the scenes I’m not in because there’s a real-life Office vibe: someone will put a stapler on their head and we’ll all fall about laughing.”Interviewing Jamie and Natasia, the rhythm of their conversation and the way they make each other laugh is infectious. At one point they go on a lengthy riff about “how they met”, networking on the landing and showing each other their poos.Perhaps the sweetest part of Stath Lets Flats is the relationships behind it. Most of these actors have been friends for years, and all of them speak about how grateful they feel for this opportunity. When I leave they stay at the bar, catching up like it’s been years since they last hung out, even though it’s only been a few weeks.“Touch all the wood, long may we be able to work on projects like this,” says Natasia. “I grew up watching Big Train, these collectives of comedians who knew each other, and as a comedy fan you knew who was going out, who were best friends. It’s so rare now to do something like that. I had tears in my eyes every day on set.” For the first time in our conversation she’s not really joking. “This is was what I dreamed of doing.”Stath Lets Flats is on Monday 19 August at 10pm on Channel 4"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e99268c426ff016a2d0de0a63c67478aed486318/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a30e1b88405fcb214a87add40b5e03e","title":"always ask if theres coffee in it mormon church stands by rule with new advice","story":"Church offers guidance to avoid unintentional rule-breaking, such as ‘the word coffee isn’t always in the name of coffee drinks’The Mormon church has renewed warnings to its younger members that there’s no grey area when it comes to the temptations of coffee – don’t drink it.“The word coffee isn’t always in the name of coffee drinks,” warns an official guidance in the August issue of a youth magazine for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “So, before you try what you think is just some new milkshake flavor, here are a couple of rules of thumb: one, if you’re in a coffee shop (or any other shop that’s well-known for its coffee), the drink you’re ordering probably has coffee in it, so either never buy drinks at coffee shops or always ask if there’s coffee in it.”The warnings come as Starbucks announced plans to open its first stand-alone shop near the church-owned Brigham Young University in the heavily Mormon city of Provo, Utah. A 2016 survey found that four in 10 active church members under age 51 had drank coffee during the previous six months.Even entering coffee shops was once considered almost taboo for past generations, religious scholars say. Expectations that the church might relax its rules – known as the Word of Wisdom – as younger Mormons grow accustomed to places like Starbucks appear misplaced.The guidance went on to say: “Drinks with names that include cafe or caffe, mocha, latte, espresso, or anything ending in -ccino usually have coffee in them and are against the Word of Wisdom.”The guidance also extends to bans on vaping and marijuana, unless prescribed by “competent” doctors, signaling that the church plans to allow members to use medical marijuana, while prohibiting recreational use.“Medical uses are being studied, but just like many pain medications such as opioids, marijuana is an addictive substance,” the article said. “Such habit-forming substances should be avoided except under the care of a competent physician, and then used only as prescribed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8577ef478823f1a432db2d42fc37c1c2534de090/0_50_3496_2098/master/3496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=140c29e7b4925a7dda3d468c0397654e","title":"israel to allow entry to rashida tlaib for humanitarian visit","story":"US congresswoman of Palestinian descent says: ‘visiting my grandmother under these oppressive conditions stands against everything I believe in’US congresswoman Rashida Tlaib has rejected an offer from Israel to visit family in the occupied West Bank on the condition she does not express certain political views.“I have decided that visiting my grandmother under these oppressive conditions stands against everything I believe in – fighting against racism, oppression \u0026amp injustice,” she wrote on Twitter.In a controversial move that drew strong rebukes from US politicians and even the most powerful US pro-Israel lobby group, Israel said on Thursday it would block Tlaib and another Democratic lawmaker, Ilhan Omar, from entering the country for a planned congressional trip to the West Bank and Jerusalem.Israel then said it would consider a “humanitarian request” for Tlaib to visit her relatives “on the condition that she pledges not to act to promote boycotts against Israel”.On Friday night President Trump criticized Tlaib for “obnoxiously” turning down Israel’s conditional offer.According to Israel’s interior ministry, Tlaib herself made a plea later on Thursday for a personal visit, which was approved on Friday morning.“I would like to request admittance to Israel in order to visit my relatives, and specifically my grandmother, who is in her 90s and lives in Beit Ur al-Fouqa,” the letter, shared by the ministry and apparently signed by Tlaib, said.In a highly unusual move for a US politician to make, she promised not to express certain views on the Palestinian issue during her trip.“This could be my last opportunity to see her. I will respect any restrictions and will not promote boycotts against Israel during my visit,” it added.Tlaib, born in and representing Michigan, is of Palestinian descent. She would have to pass through Israeli security to access the village.The congresswoman has not referred publicly to the letter and it is not clear if or why she changed her mind. However, several prominent pro-Palestinian figures have said that a visit with curbs of free speech would be a capitulation to Israel.“What is truly upsetting is that Rashida Tlaib fell in this trap and accepted to demean herself and grovel,” said Nour Odeh, a former spokeswoman for the Palestinian Authority.Thursday’s barring came shortly after the US president, Donald Trump, publicly urged Israel to block his political opponents, who he has recently attacked with racist slurs. “They are a disgrace!” he wrote on Twitter.Israel said it decided to block the two freshmen politicians for their support of the boycott, estment and sanctions (BDS) movement.To outcry from rights groups who say it tramples free speech, Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, passed a law in 2017 allowing the government to deport people who support a boycott of Israel or Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.It has since used the law against critics, activists and human rights groups.Omar and Tlaib, the first Muslim women to serve in Congress, have openly criticised Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.Both women have said they support the use of boycotts to pressure governments, including Israel’s, on rights abuses. They have recently sought to pass a resolution in the House of Representatives championing the right to participate in them.The pair’s cancelled trip would have avoided meeting Israeli officials or visiting Israel, apart from to pass through, in a move that was interpreted as adhering to the boycott.The BDS movement seeks to end the Israeli occupation in the Palestinian territories and discrimination against Palestinian citizens of Israel, who account for almost a fifth of the population. It also demands that Israel allow several million Palestinian refugees and their families to return to their homes.Israel argues the movement is antisemitic and seeks to dismantle Israel as a Jewish state by reducing its Jewish majority.While BDS has gathered some high-profile international support, its comprehensive boycott tactics that include academic and cultural isolation have alienated some who support Palestinian rights but also want engagement with Israel and Israelis.Earlier this year, the Icelandic rock band Hatari hoped to use the stage at Eurovision Tel Aviv to voice their support for Palestinians but were criticised by BDS for attending."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b30274804f04b4dde8ac26c8051e266a6badd3c8/0_84_2550_1530/master/2550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f660993388e7fcdea274e6c900dc580f","title":"disneys mulan star sparks call for boycott with hong kong stance","story":"Crystal Liu, the lead in Disney’s live-action remake, voiced support for police in the cityDisney’s live-action remake of Mulan is facing calls for a boycott after its star voiced support for police in Hong Kong.Crystal Liu, also known as Liu Yifei, reportedly posted a message on the Chinese social media site Weibo, which translated as: “I also support Hong Kong police. You can beat me up now.” In English, the post added: “What a shame for Hong Kong.”Though Twitter and many other social media sites are censored within China, the comments provoked fierce criticism elsewhere and the hashtag BoycottMulan began trending.Liu’s comments were an apparent reference to chants heard by pro-police activists demonstrating in support of a journalist who was beaten by pro-democracy protesters. A T-shirt bearing the slogan “I love HK police” was reportedly found in a bag belonging to Fu Guohao, a journalist from the Chinese state newspaper the Global Times.Police have meted out violence against pro-democracy demonstrators during heightened tensions in the former British colony.The protests were originally sparked by controversial extradition proposals from the Hong Kong government in June which would have allowed some suspects to be sent to mainland China for trials. That led to fears of Hong Kong’s independent legal system being bypassed, with people being pulled into China’s legal system which can involve televised confessions and a lack of judicial safeguards.The government suspended the planned legislation but protesters have pressed on with broader calls for it to be scrapped entirely, along with demands for democratic reforms.Following Liu’s social media post, critics accused the naturalised US citizen of supporting police brutality and denying Hong Kong citizens the rights she enjoyed in her adopted country.She is not the only star who has been criticised for their stance on the protests. The martial artist Jackie Chan, who was born in Hong Kong, has been accused of failing to support pro-democracy protesters. He reportedly told China’s state broadcaster CCTV that the events were “sad and depressing”, adding: “I have visited many countries and I can say our country has been rapidly developing in recent years. I feel pride in being Chinese wherever I go and the ‘five-starred Red Flag’ is respected everywhere around the world.”Disney has been contacted for comment. Mulan, a live-action reimagining of the 1998 animated film, is set to be released next March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c0d5419ad149cbe8be8f5a51b8c2b359a8e2ae0/0_0_7777_4667/master/7777.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42cc2caf6a611fb865703653b51ad1ae","title":"london council saves gay fetish club from redevelopment","story":"Tower Hamlets says Backstreet bar is ‘important community asset’ and blocks 46-flat towerThe UK’s last remaining strict leather and rubber fetish gay club has been saved after a London council blocked plans to redevelop the East End site into a 12-storey residential tower.Tower Hamlets ruled against the proposed 46-flat development on Mile End Road because it would “harm the long-term provision of a nightclub that serves the LGBT+ community”.Cllr Rachel Blake, the borough’s deputy mayor, said the council viewed the 34-year-old Backstreet bar as “an important community asset” and was “going the extra mile… to protect safe spaces for our erse community”.“It is the last true gay fetish club, and ersity matters to us,” she said. “This kind of venue really matters to us, it matters to Tower Hamlets and to the whole of London. It is very important to have safe spaces for the whole community.”Dozens of men who regularly visit the Backstreet, which boasts the “strictest fetish dress code in Europe”, wrote to the council during the six-year planning battle to explain the importance of the club to them.On his first visit, Easton, a stage manager, dashed from an Uber cab to the venue’s nondescript black doors so as not to be spotted by members of the public in his head-to-toe leather outfit. “But when I got to the door I realised it was cash only, and I had only cards,” he said. “So I had to walk to the cash machine. But it was good, it made me more confident.”Now Easton goes to the club about once a month and is starting to feel like part of the community. “It’s a real time warp that hasn’t been updated since the 80s, with boots and whips hanging from the ceiling,” he said. “People say: ‘Don’t you find it really scary?’ But actually it’s a really warm, friendly and sociable space.“It’s nice that we have a place that we can go without judgment. I know that I’m not going to be heckled for what I wear and what I do, which might happen in a regular gay venue.“I had my 21st birthday party in there, but I’m by far the youngest person who goes there. Most of the people are in their 30s to 40s, and there are some in their 50s to 60s. What other gay bar do you get that in? It’s a really nice thing.”It is the second time Tower Hamlets has made planning rulings to protect an LGBT venue. In 2017 the council ruled that the redevelopment of the Joiners Arms bar on Hackney Road could  go ahead only if the new building contained a similar-sized gay bar. Blake said saving the Backstreet was more important than saving a standard gay bar because it served “a particular niche of the community”. “When there is a rise in hate crime, we must stand up for those with all backgrounds, and it is important that people can enjoy themselves in a safe space without external judgment.”Tower Hamlets blocked the proposed housing scheme even though the developer, a subsidiary of Galliard Homes, had promised to preserve the Backstreet in the basement of the new tower, and pay £22,500 to move and store the club’s collection of fetish equipment, including boots, whips, rubber and gas masks.Blake said councillors worried that putting the club in the basement of a residential building would have led to its demise. “So much of my inbox is noise complaints,” she said. “The reality is noise would have led to its closure.”In the ruling against the development, the planning inspector Julia Gregory said: “I am also not convinced that the nightclub would be well received by parents with young children living above … or would be considered a benefit by future residents.” Gregory said she was therefore not satisfied that the future of the club was protected. A spokeswoman for Galliard declined to comment.Nigel Whitfield, a Backstreet regular and director of the Breeches and Leather Uniform Fanclub which has led much of the campaigning against the development, said it was “flabbergasting” that Tower Hamlets council had spent so much time listening to club regulars’ concerns. “It is simply unimaginable that 20 years ago a council officer would write reams of pages in defence of a leather nightclub,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48fb36e57611dd0314431d1b49b6c442d527cf5/0_102_2031_1218/master/2031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a9e68107305d68ec871d7958f15fc33","title":"us customs systems outage delays travel airports","story":"Social media posts show serious congestion as ‘temporary’ issue affects hubs including JFK and LAXThousands of travelers at major US airports faced congested terminals and long lines on Friday due to a temporary computer outage that affected the US Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) processing systems.Airports warned travelers – Americans returning home and foreign visitors – of delays, and some tweeted photos and videos of huge lines.A CBP spokeswoman said the systems were running again by early evening on the east coast.The agency didn’t precisely describe the breakdown, but the spokeswoman said there was “no indication of any nefarious activity”.

But Gaye ended up living in the down-at-heel resort for nearly 18 months, during which he penned one of his biggest hits, Sexual Healing, from his seafront rooms at the Residence Jane apartment block.Gaye would have turned 80 this April. He was shot dead by his father, a Pentecostal preacher, the day before his 45th birthday – barely 18 months after leaving Belgium’s shores.But Ostend’s tourist board thinks there is a much bigger market to tap into. News that the record producer, rapper and business mogul Dr Dre has acquired the film rights and the rights to Gaye’s musical catalogue, with the approval of the family estate, has set hares running. There is even talk of a Marvin Gaye museum.“And I think we would need a movie project to make that happen. If you are a big Marvin Gaye fan and you want to spend a weekend in Ostend then the walkumentary is two hours, but you need to offer more than that. We have had talks with some people – nothing concrete – who still have some material about him and there are possibilities but building up a museum is quite a big thing to do.”Hens said Dre had not yet made contact with the town, but a call would not be entirely unexpected.“There was a film project five years ago in which Lenny Kravitz was going to play Marvin Gaye. Kravitz was here in Ostend doing research and we did the tour with him. We went to Residence Jane and Moere (a village close to Ostend where Gaye bought a property).“Lenny Kravitz backed out because the family didn’t support it. The family contacted him and he backed off. There is still a trailer online because they tried to sell the movie but it didn’t work out.”Gaye turned around his health while in Ostend, running on the wide open beach, playing basketball in the local courts and avoiding the temptations of Los Angeles, where he would die in 1984 at the hands of his father in the mansion he had bought for his parents.“There are plenty of places I’d like to be rather than Ostend,” Gaye once said, “but this where I need to be.”Marc Van den Kerchove, 58, the owner of the Taverne Floride, a bar on the wide Albert I promenade frequented by Gaye, said a film would be a massive boost to the town.“He would come in here for a Leffe beer after having a jog,” Van den Kerchove said. “All the other bars he would go to don’t exist now. We get a lot of his fans from all over in here, from Japan, America, everywhere. The regulars remember him. I’m a fan of his music certainly and a film would be great.”Gaye’s last European performance was at Ostend’s Kursaal concert hall, where there is a statue of the star. “At the end of his life he was considering going back to Ostend because here he could be himself without being seduced by drugs and all the problems related to that,” Hens said.“We are still waiting for the film – but that’s the fun thing about Marvin Gaye: it’s timeless. There will always be Marvin Gaye and Sexual Healing.”2 April 1939 Marvin Pentz Gay Jr (he would only later add the last “e” to his surname) is born in Washington DC to the Pentecostal minister Marvin Gay Sr and Alberta Gay, a domestic worker.1959 Gaye joins the Moonglows vocal group and comes to the attention of Berry Gordy Jr who signs him up for his label, Motown Records.1963 Gaye marries Gordy’s daughter, Anna, who is 17 years his senior. They orce in 1975.1971 Gaye writes What’s Going On after witnessing police brutality at a rally against the Vietnam war. Motown releases the record.1972 The prince of Motown, as he became known, moves to Los Angeles where he meets Janis Hunter, who would later become his second wife. He records Let’s Get It On.1981 In dispute with Motown, hunted by the IRS over a tax bill and struggling with a cocaine addiction, Gaye takes up the offer of a Belgian concert promoter to stay in Ostend, a Belgian seaside resort.1982 He signs with CBS records and works on the album Midnight Love. The first single, Sexual Healing, is written and recorded in Ostend. It would be his biggest career hit, spending a record 10 weeks at No 1.1984 The day before his 45th birthday, Gaye intervenes during a fight between his parents. He kicks and beats his father. Gay Sr shoots his son in the heart, and the left shoulder, at point-blank range. Gaye is pronounced dead at California hospital medical centre."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Pedestrian hit by pole which driver crashed into in Clonmel died early on SaturdayJust over a fifth of all stations are now open for 24 hours, analysis shows.Data Protection Commissioner\u0026rsquos report found documentation retention unlawfulChanges proposed will not fix traffic problems in the area, local councillor saysClaims made that two entrances to be used, one for elected members and one for staffLimerick non-profit calls on Government to ensure asylum seekers receive basic supportsThere are troubling parallels between conditions 50 years ago and the situation nowAugust 17th 1969: Drawing on contemporaneous reports, Donnacha \u0026Oacute Beach\u0026aacutein describes the day\u0026rsquos events as they unfoldedAmong objectors are two prominent international environmental organisationsAuthorities accuse dual citizen Daniel Mullan (80) of abusing children for decadesMichael Downing was \u0026lsquosimply in the wrong place at the wrong time\u0026rsquo when shot in the LibertiesBritish PM to meet Macron in Paris and Merkel in Berlin ahead of G7 summitGarda\u0026iacute investigating incident in Clonmel after pedestrian in his 50s suffers injury\u0026lsquoYou can have your Rugby World Cup, you can have your soccer, but Kilkenny in an All-Ireland, it\u0026rsquos like winning the lotto\u0026rsquoUCD students union president says development `incredibly concerning\u0027News, views and opinions from Student Hub contributors and  writersWestern Building Systems has called for report deadline into school building programmeGarda\u0026iacute ordered to assist in bringing woman back to hospital if she is removedMore than \u0026euro1,500 in cash seized and man in his 30s arreted over findFamily allowed short service to seek another stay against fund in High Court next Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3988653.1565988054!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"public services card report a vindication for campaigners","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Public Service Card: There will be a large cohort of civil servants and politicians licking their wounds this weekend.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe: grinning image will not date well. Photograph: Eric Luke The findings of the Data Protection Commissioner’s report into the Public Services Card are a vindication for many parties.A group of campaigners and legal experts has closely invigilated the progress of the project, tracking it closely as it spawned new functions, and often suffering the targeted ire of those in power for their efforts. The issue was also covered closely by a number of journalists. It is also a major fillip for the DPC itself, which has for years pushed back against claims that it is a toothless regulator, too cosy with those it is supposed to be regulating. As the European regulator of tech giants like Facebook and Google, the DPC will have to win bigger battles on a global stage to fully disprove this thesis, but it has shown steel here. Conversely, there will be a large cohort of civil servants and politicians licking their wounds this weekend. The PSC is a long-haul project. It was first mooted in 1998, and has been nursed along by generations of officials. It is far from dead, but if the DPC ruling stands, its scope and its putative utility to the Civil Service will be a shadow of what was once imagined. In addition, its champions must now deal with their pet project being traduced as a sinister manifestation of a creeping surveillance state. The State has been remarkably bullish in its defence of the PSC, and has roped various Ministers into the cause Paschal Donohoe grinning next to an oversized PSC is not an image that will date well – nor Regina Doherty’s “mandatory, not compulsory” line. Sequence of crisesThis is a government that has weathered multiple controversies – the national children’s hospital, the National Broadband Plan and CervicalCheck, as well as the rolling thunder of the housing and healthcare crises. The last thing it wants is yet another political scandal chipping away at public confidence. Not to mention that some Government TDs are feeling battle fatigue, and have concluded that the public lost enthusiasm for their governance a long time ago. So, what next? The department and its Minister did a disappearing act on Friday, responding only in the briefest terms to the controversy. The DPC has put a firm timeline on the department’s response: it wants officials to stop processing personal data in relation to non-social welfare business within 21 days, and contact the bodies currently requiring production of the card to tell them they are no longer issuing PSCs for such purposes. Within six weeks, it must bring an implementation plan forward detailing how it plans to respond and what changes it plans to make. There is a school of thought that views the silence from the department as ominous. Earlier this summer, there was a little-covered finding against the department by the DPC, in relation to child benefit. Rather than take it lying down, the department immediately sought to judicially review the decision. That may be an indication of how aggressively officials will defend their patch on this issue. There is an honestly held conviction in the department that the PSC is good public policy. Questions put to the department on whether it was considering a challenge went unanswered on Friday. However, any challenge must be balanced against the increasingly toxic politics of the scheme a government department in open rebellion against a regulator that the State has poured massive resources and political capital into in recent years is just bad PR.There is a second salvo from the DPC in the offing. It is putting the finishing touches to another report on the card, specifically the biometric and photographic aspects. More adverse findings would fuel the controversy further. There is also the question of immediate consequences for the department, and for other bodies who had insisted on the use of the card. The DPC said on Friday that fines aren’t possible arising from this investigation – it was conducted under different legislation to the powerful General Data Protection Regulation laws which allow it to levy penalties of up to €1 million on public sector bodies. But it remains an option to launch another investigation based on its findings, especially if it considers unlawful activity – such as the blanket retention of data – to have occurred after May 25th,2018, when the GDPR came into force.Finally, there is a good chance legal cases will be taken against the department or another public sector body. At least one civil society group is actively considering such a step. The Public Services Card has its fair share of enemies, many of them in the legal profession. They are unlikely to be presented with a better chance to take a case. Their chances of success in a multiparty action are hard to determine, but the risk of being on the wrong end of a costly and embarrassing court defeat will concentrate minds in the public sector.Undoubtedly, this saga has some way to run.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe State could face costly legal action arising from the public services card (PSC) controversy, with civil society groups saying they are considering class-action style cases.The Data Protection Commissioner, in a damning report sent to the Department of Social Protection this week, found the retention of documentation on millions of citizens was unlawful, as was the basis for the card to be demanded for access to a range of public services.Digital Rights Ireland chairman TJ McIntyre told The  the group was considering a civil multiparty action arising from alleged violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in how the scheme was run.“It’s fair to say we are considering it,” said Mr McIntyre, who is an associate professor in the UCD school of law and whose group has long-opposed the card. “You could certainly have a case where you had people into the hundreds, or conceivably into the thousands, who were particularly aggrieved by it. Someone forced to get a PSC in relation to a driving licence, or a passport, and they stated their opposition at the time and this was ignored, they certainly would be in a claim like that,” he said.CompensationSimon McGarr, a solicitor and data protection expert, said sections of the GDPR made a legal case easier as there was a recourse to compensation for non-material loss, a lower legal hurdle to clear than traditionally would be the case in a civil case. He claimed it was “the largest contingent risk the State has ever faced”.He said every public body that insisted on the card could be liable. “The liability is triggered by the fact they allowed data to be processed on their watch,” he said.However the commissioner said there was no possibility of fines arising from its completed investigation as it was conducted under pre-GDPR legislation. However the Department of Social Protection said if another investigation was to be initiated based on the findings of the latest inquiry, fines could then be levied.Political fallout from the controversy gathered momentum on Friday, with the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee saying he would call the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before the committee next month.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty said: “We only received the report yesterday. It’s a very comprehensive report. We are going to consider the report and issue a full response as soon as we can.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"\u0026lsquoI can\u0026rsquot wait for them to come.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Vulnerable since the day she was born’: Nóra Quoirin. Photograph: Lucie Blackman TrustFamily handoutPA WireThe Quoirin family had planned to spend two weeks of August relaxing in Malaysia, and Nóra – “fun, funny and extremely loving” – was excited about the holiday. But the 15-year-old, who had special needs, was also “not like other teenagers… not independent”, they said.After she was found to be missing from the Dusun holiday resort, on Sunday, August 4th, shortly after their arrival, they explained: “Nóra can read like a young child, but she cannot write more than a few words. She has a good memory, but she cannot understand anything conceptual. She is unable to do maths, and so things like money are impossible to manage.”They added that Nóra’s balance was limited and that she struggled with co-ordination. “She has been to Asia, and many European countries before, and has never wandered off or got lost.Nóra Quoirin’s body was found on Tuesday, August 13th, by a group of hikers who had volunteered their help. It was the 10th day of the search for the schoolgirl.She was found unclothed, near a stream, in a hard-to-access hilly area that had already been covered by the search-and-rescue operation. The location is 2km from the resort the family had checked in to 11 days earlier. It is an area of dense jungle near the town of Seremban, about 60km from the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.Her body was flown to Seremban by helicopter. On Thursday, Malaysian police announced the results of a 10-hour postmortem and said there was no evidence of foul play. The chief of police in the state of Negeri Sembilan, Mohamad Mat Yusop, said: “The cause of death was upper-gastrointestinal bleeding due to a duodenal ulcer complicated with perforation.” There was no evidence that Nóra had been abducted or raped, he added.The bleeding in Nóra’s intestine could have been caused by prolonged hunger and stress, Mohamad said the pathologists dated Nóra’s death to two or three days before her body was found, and to no more than four days.The Quoirin family, who have lived in London for about 20 years, have said they will now bring her home, “where she will finally be laid to rest, close to her loving families in France and Ireland”.Their statement issued on Friday says: “The initial postmortem results have given some information that help us to understand Nóra’s cause of death. But our beautiful, innocent girl died in extremely complex circumstances, and we are hoping that soon we will have more answers to our many questions. We are still struggling to understand the events of the last 10 days.”The Lucie Blackman Trust, which has been helping the family, says that investigations in France will continue. It also urges an end to public speculation. “The police hotline remains open, and the family are still seeking any information from the public that can help to provide clarity on the events of the last 10 days.”A reward of 50,000 ringgit, or about €10,800, had been offered the day before Nóra’s body was found, donated by an anonymous Belfast-based business. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which was set up to support British nationals in crisis overseas, has confirmed that none of the reward has been paid in connection with the discovery of the teenager’s body.Dusun Eco Resort sits in a durian orchard in the foothills of the Titiwangsa Mountains, next to the 1,600-hectare, or 4,000-acre, Berembun Forest Reserve, which is home to sun bears, white-handed gibbons, macaques, wild pigs, panthers, tapirs and muntjac. Locals have seen leopard tracks. The resort has six guest houses on the top of a small hill.Many visitors scale Gunung Telapak Buruk, the highest mountain in the vicinity, and some seek out a site where a second World War plane crashed. Locals say many hikers get lost without a torch when night falls, having underestimated the time it takes to get to the crash site.Several questions remain about Nóra’s disappearance and death. Why would she have left the resort in the middle of the night? Did she climb out of the downstairs window that was found open when she disappeared and on which police found unidentified fingerprints?Why was her body found unclothed? If Nóra did walk off into the jungle, why could sniffer dogs pick up her scent only in the immediate vicinity of the guest house? Does this suggest she was abducted?Nóra’s body was found in an area that had already been covered by search-and-rescue teams, so how is it that they did not see her?The area where Nóra’s body was found had been covered until day seven of Nóra’s disappearance. Perhaps, Mohamad Mat Yusop said, Nóra was still moving around at that time. After day seven the search-and-rescue teams concentrated on the Gunung Berembun area.A Daily Mail reporter, Paul Thompson, interviewed Sean Yeap, one of the hikers who discovered Nóra’s body. Yeap told him that the body was not hidden or covered with foliage and said he would have expected search teams that had passed through the area previously to have found it, had it been there at the time.Although police say the bleeding in Nóra’s intestine was most likely caused by prolonged hunger and stress, stomach ulcers can be caused by Helicobacter pylori bacteria. Nóra might have drunk contaminated water, although this cannot be established.“It is not possible she would have willingly left with a stranger,” he said. “If she went out alone by mistake, she would have banged on the door and screamed to be let back in.”Pacôme Quoirin said the family did not question the information released by Malaysian police after the postmortem. “Her death was caused by a haemorrhage, as they said. But what were the conditions that led to it? The findings that were announced in no way discredit a criminal act. She could have been kidnapped and fed at the beginning. There is insufficient evidence to jump to definitive conclusions.”The Quoirins’ lawyer Sankara N Nair said on Wednesday that he would contact the Malaysian attorney general, Tommy Thomas, about holding an inquest into Nóra’s death if the postmortem provided evidence to support that course of action.On Thursday the Malay Mail quoted the Negeri Sembilan police chief as saying the Irish and French police who observed the postmortem were satisfied with the work of the team who had carried it out. The Irish authorities had not requested a second examination.The search for Nóra involved expert trackers from the Senoi Praaq special unit, made up mainly of members of the Orang Asli indigenous people, and members of the elite 69 Commando unit of the Royal Malaysian Police. Divers searched the river that runs through the forest, and helicopters and drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras were deployed.To aid in the search, a recording of Nóra’s mother’s voice was played via megaphones. Search teams also played the recording of Meabh Quoirin’s voice on their mobile phones as they went through the jungle.The Lucie Blackman Trust has been helping the family to deal with the media, and organised the printing of 10,000 flyers to be distributed in Kuala Lumpur and several Malaysian states, including Melaka and Johor.More than £104,000, or €114,000, has been raised by a GoFundMe appeal launched by Aisling Agnew, Nóra’s aunt, on behalf of Nóra’s family. Nearly €20,000 has been raised in a separate GoFundMe appeal set up by Pacôme Quoirin.Hundreds of people in Seremban prayed for Nóra during the Muslim festival of Hari Raya Aidiladha, as Malaysians call Eid ul-Fitr.The Dusun family and staff also expressed their condolences. “We are devastated by the turn of events, and we would like to extend our support and assistance in whatever way possible to the Quoirins during these very difficult times,” they said. A Dusun spokeswoman said on Friday that while investigations continued she could not respond to criticisms of the resort for having insufficient CCTV.There is much speculation about Nóra’s disappearance. It ranges from the cautious public statements by some members of the Quoirin family, gently probing aspects of the investigation, to the numerous theories – some fanciful – advanced on social media.Many Malaysians believe in spirits and there is even talk of her having being hidden by the Orang bunian, supernatural beings known as the hidden or whistling people, who are said to be invisible except to people with spiritual sight and are generally regarded as benevolent.The tragedy has had an impact both locally and internationally, but none have felt it so keenly as her family. After Nóra’s disappearance and the harrowing search for her, the Quoirins are having to deal not only with the results of the postmortem but also with the devastating loss of a girl her mother described as “precious” and “vulnerable since the day she was born”.Her family have many unanswered questions. Some may never be answered, but, as the investigation by Malaysian police continues, the hope is that at least the most important ones will be."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Comment: India and Pakistan must look beyond KashmirRecord number of GCSE appeals expected, amid concern about marking reliabilityRace to save the rainforest: Why replacing cocaine barons with cattle ranchers is destroying the AmazonComment: Our anti-capitalist, anti-Western universities no longer care about excellenceBlustery showers look set to deny Britain a bank holiday heatwavePeter Fonda dies aged 79 from respiratory failureBritish armed forces have retention, not recruitment crisis, new figures showWe \u0026#39shouldn\u0026#39t apologise\u0026#39 for the race or gender of those who made the most celebrated classical music, Nicola Benedetti says Paedophiles should be tried again for abuse if new evidence emerges, says the victims\u0026#39 commissionerPlastic bottles can be turned into lighter, cheaper prosthetic limbsLitter fines by private contractors employed by councils soar over 200,000 in just one yearComment: Hammond the hypocrite is making a no-deal Brexit even more likelyRevealed: Police raided council-run travellers\u0026#39 campsite after Pc Andrew Harper was dragged to his death\u0026#39Gaukeward squad\u0026#39 of rebels plot against Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit strategySajid Javid says taxes could be cut for middle class earners this AutumnJohn Humphrys: I was foolish to chase off intruder with pair of garden secateursKen Clarke says he is willing to become caretaker Prime Minister to \u0026#39sort Brexit out\u0026#39Carrie Symonds takes aim at puffin killers in first public outingWhy Nora\u0026#39s family may never know the truth behind her mysterious deathWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"a level results day 2019 students across country receive results","story":"A-level students across most of the country received their results today, with the majority of subjects redesigned to exclude coursework and modules.

This means that girls are once again higher performers than boys when it comes to the top grades, with A* or A making up 25.5 of female entries against boys’ 25.4 per cent.Benjamin Sheridan, 19, left,

You can all stack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong.The post comes amid heightened tensions in the former British colony, where pro-democracy demonstrators clashed with local police in protests originally sparked by controversial extradition proposals.It provoked fierce criticism in the west and the hashtag #BoycottMulan began trending online.Critics accused Liu, now a US citizen, of supporting police brutality and denying Hong Kong citizens the rights she enjoys in her adopted country.She is not the only star who has been criticised for their stance on the protests.Martial artist Jackie Chan, who was born in Hong Kong, reportedly told Chinese TV CCTV that the events were sad and depressing.He added: I have visited many countries and I can say our country has been rapidly developing in recent years. I feel pride in being Chinese wherever I go and the \u0027five-starred Red Flag\u0027 is respected everywhere around the world.He was accused of failing to support pro-democracy protesters.Demonstrators first took to the streets in June after the Hong Kong government put forward controversial extradition proposals that would have allowed some suspects to be sent to mainland China for trials.This led to fears of Hong Kong\u0027s independent legal system being bypassed, with people being pulled into China\u0027s legal system - which can involve television confessions and a lack of judicial safeguards seen in Hong Kong and the UK.The government suspended the planned legislation although protesters have pressed on with broader calls for it to be scrapped entirely along with demands for democratic reforms.Disney has been contacted for comment. Mulan, a live-action reimagining of the 1998 animated film, is set to arrive in March next year.Comment: India and Pakistan must look beyond KashmirRecord number of GCSE appeals expected, amid concern about marking reliabilityRace to save the rainforest: Why replacing cocaine barons with cattle ranchers is destroying the AmazonComment: Our anti-capitalist, anti-Western universities no longer care about excellenceBlustery showers look set to deny Britain a bank holiday heatwavePeter Fonda dies aged 79 from respiratory failureBritish armed forces have retention, not recruitment crisis, new figures showWe \u0026#39shouldn\u0026#39t apologise\u0026#39 for the race or gender of those who made the most celebrated classical music, Nicola Benedetti says Paedophiles should be tried again for abuse if new evidence emerges, says the victims\u0026#39 commissionerPlastic bottles can be turned into lighter, cheaper prosthetic limbsLitter fines by private contractors employed by councils soar over 200,000 in just one yearComment: Hammond the hypocrite is making a no-deal Brexit even more likelyRevealed: Police raided council-run travellers\u0026#39 campsite after Pc Andrew Harper was dragged to his death\u0026#39Gaukeward squad\u0026#39 of rebels plot against Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit strategySajid Javid says taxes could be cut for middle class earners this AutumnJohn Humphrys: I was foolish to chase off intruder with pair of garden secateursKen Clarke says he is willing to become caretaker Prime Minister to \u0026#39sort Brexit out\u0026#39Carrie Symonds takes aim at puffin killers in first public outingWhy Nora\u0026#39s family may never know the truth behind her mysterious deathWomen take legal action over breast implant cancer riskWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/16/15/best-child-performances.jpg","title":"best child actor film performances good boys jacob tremblay list","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsThe best young stars to have graced the cinema screenClick to followThe Independent CultureIn cinema, it\u0027s always a risky bet when casting children in key roles. Pick incorrectly and it could derail the whole enterprise.Find the right person, though – someone with the right blend of confidence, naivety and unselfconsciousness – and the results can be breathtaking.This week sees Jacob Tremblay continue his run of impressive roles with Good Boys, which follows three sixth grade boys who ditch school and embark on an epic journey while carrying accidentally stolen drugs. Before that, he starred in the 2015 drama Room, giving a performance that was as deserving of an Oscar as his co-star Brie Larson, who took home Best Actress. And he’s still only 12.In celebration, we\u0027ve counted down the 18 most memorable performances by children in cinema. Click through the gallery below to see who made the cut.Created with Sketch.18 best child performances in film history Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.118 Christina Ricci in The Addams Family (1991)In the 27 years since she was transferred to the big screen via Christina Ricci, Wednesday Addams has become less a character and more a mood, a religion and a lifestyle. Ricci’s deadpan performance is so gloriously apathetic and mean that she comfortably steals the show from her adult co-stars, and deservedly had her role beefed up for the film’s sequel. (AW)218 Saoirse Ronan in Atonement (2007)Since Atonement, Ronan has become one of the most accomplished actors of her generation. And it’s no surprise, given how convincingly she brought to life, at the age of 13, Ian McEwan’s precocious and stubborn protagonist Briony Tallis, whose misinterpretation of a romantic encounter between her sister and her childhood friend wreaks havoc in the lives of those around her. (EH)318 Quvenzhané Wallis in Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012)Quvenzhané Wallis is proof that lying sometimes gets you places. As a five-year-old, the child star convinced her parents to let her fib about her age so that she could audition for Beasts of the Southern Wild – their minimum age was six. So impressed was director Benh Zeitlin by Wallis that he changed his entire script so that the character of Hushpuppy matched her stubborn personality. At the age of nine, she became the youngest Best Actress nominee in Oscars history. (JS)418 Aleksei Kravchenko in Come and See (1985)Horrific war film Come and See – which depicts Nazism through a child’s eyes – is a nightmarish but essential experience, if only to witness the performance of Aleksei Kravchenko. It would have been tough for an actor of any age to film the scenes asked of him by director Elem Klimov let alone a 14-year old one, but Kravchenko commits so nobly it’s hard to tear your eyes from the screen. He found the shoot so troubling that he reportedly developed grey hair. (JS)518 Jean-Pierre Léaud in The 400 Blows (1959)Jean-Pierre Léaud was one of several hundred boys who François Truffaut auditioned for The 400 Blows and it’s easy to see why he won the role. In Truffaut, Léaud found a mentor –  he took control of the 15-year-old\u0027s upbringing when shooting ended after he was expelled from school and kicked out of his carers’ home – and Léaud would return as the character five more times. (JS)618 Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone (1990)Considering he starts Home Alone as an obnoxious “little jerk”, it’s a testament to Macaulay Culkin’s skill that Kevin McCallister manages to worm his way into viewers’ hearts . Culkin has insane amounts of fun ruling the roost when his family accidentally forget to bring him on their Christmas holiday, and it never fails to be a gleeful experience watching Kevin runs rings around bumbling burglars Harry (Daniel Stern) and Marv (Joe Pesci). (JS)718 Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine (2006)Breslin became one of the youngest Oscar nominees of all time when she received a nod for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, aged 10, as Olive Hoover in the beloved 2006 road movie. She played an underdog youngster on a mission to win a beauty contest, accompanied by her quirky and dysfunctional family, with real wit and flair. (EH)818 Alex Hibbert in Moonlight (2016)Giving a performance in perfect symmetry to the film around him, Alex Hibbert is one of a number of brilliantly subtle actors in Moonlight. Only on screen for the film’s first third, he mostly inhabits a quiet and devastating yearning, embodying a character buried under the emotional weight of playground bullying and constant domestic upheaval, and desperate for someone to show him compassion and answer his questions. If Hollywood has any sense, Moonlight will be just the first of many incredible opportunities for the young star. (AW)918 Mara Wilson in Mrs Doubtfire (1993)Mara Wilson is one of those great child star success stories, immortalised in at least three classic movies while still in single-digits, retiring early, and now writing, podcasting and saying smart, funny things on Twitter. But while 1996’s Matilda is often talked about as her best work, she was somehow even more brilliant in Mrs Doubtfire three years earlier, where she is adorable and grouchy and seems to possess a beautifully sincere, if today bittersweet, joy over merely being in Robin Williams’s company. (AW)1018 Isabelle Fuhrman in Orphan (2009)Isabelle Fuhrman is scarily convincing in her role as Esther, the sickly-sweet orphan girl turned murderous dwarf asylum escapee. The sexual and violent nature of some scenes may be uncomfortable to watch, but there is no denying Fuhrman executes them perfectly. (MH)1118 Tatum O’Neal in Paper Moon (1973)Tatum O’Neal was, and still is, the youngest person to ever win an Oscar for her role as the sassy, smoking, swindling tomboy Addie in Paper Moon. Addie may or may not be the daughter of con man Moses, who is reluctantly saddled with the youngster before realising she can help him with his scams. Moses is played by O’Neal’s real-life father Ryan O’Neal, and there’s just no faking that kind of chemistry. (AP)1218 Lindsay Lohan in The Parent Trap (1998)Lohan was just 12 when she played identical twins Annie and Hallie in the 1998 classic. While the sisters were of course impossible to distinguish by their looks, their personalities and backgrounds could hardly have been more different: one was a well-to-do Londoner, the other a boisterous American tomboy. The young star impressed audiences with her ability to switch effortlessly and convincingly between the two. (EH)1318 Heather O’Rourke in Poltergeist (1982)Heather O’Rourke tragically died aged just 12 in 1988, but she will long be remembered as the ethereal blonde Carol Anne Freeling. Cast after a chance meeting with Steven Spielberg, she captivates the audience as a little girl who can communicate with “the other side” through the family television set. (MH)1418 Jacob Tremblay in Room (2015)Egregiously overlooked for an Oscar in 2016, Jacob Tremblay\u0027s performance in Room will pull out heartstrings you never knew you had. As Jack, a long-haired five-year-old who has been imprisoned in a garden shed all his life and is oblivious to the outside world, he not only raises the film\u0027s cute quotient, but also brings surprising depth. His is a turn of great maturity, one that scratches away at the fact that Jack has never had any male interaction. Brie Larson, who plays his mum, did win an Oscar for her role here. (PS)1518 Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense (1999)Haley Joel Osment’s performance as Cole Sear, a young boy tormented by his ability to see and talk to the dead, is so strong that he remains the most memorable part of the M Night Shyamalan film, despite a career-best turn from Bruce Willis and one of the most effective twists in cinema history. (JS)1618 River Phoenix in Stand by Me (1986)One of the few comforts to cling onto when thinking of River Phoenix’s tragic death aged 23 is that he was at least able to showcase his vast acting range before he died. The actor, whose brother is Joaquin Phoenix, played everything from tortured teenagers to tough adventurers and street hustlers. But perhaps his finest work came early, in 1986’s Stand by Me, when he played a sensitive pre-teen who masks insecurity and self-loathing beneath a veneer of macho posturing. It’s a staggering bit of acting from someone so young. (AW)1718 Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit (2010)It’s probably not true to say that Hailee Steinfeld is the only person who could have pulled off the role of the fearless Mattie Ross in the Coen brothers’ adaptation of Charles Portis novel True Grit – but from the moment she arrives in Fort Smith with plans to hunt down her father’s killer, she makes you feel like she is. How she didn\u0027t win Best Supporting Actress at the 2011 Oscars will remain a mystery. (JS)1818 Heather Matarazzo in Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995)Generally speaking, children acting in Todd Solondz movies need to have nerves of steel and far more self-confidence than average youngsters. But it takes a child of unusual gutsiness to enact the horrors inflicted upon poor Dawn Wiener in his 1995 film Welcome to the Dollhouse. A yearning, eager loner played to perfection by Heather Matarazzo, Dawn is the recipient of a level of casual cruelty that would feel fetishistic if it weren\u0027t so tragically true to life. When she was killed off before the credits in Solondz’s 2004 film Palindromes, the collective mourning it inspired in his fanbase was only a result of how powerfully Matarazzo’s performance lingered. (AW)118 Christina Ricci in The Addams Family (1991)In the 27 years since she was transferred to the big screen via Christina Ricci, Wednesday Addams has become less a character and more a mood, a religion and a lifestyle. Ricci’s deadpan performance is so gloriously apathetic and mean that she comfortably steals the show from her adult co-stars, and deservedly had her role beefed up for the film’s sequel.

And should we be worried?What’s going on in financial markets?A closely watched indicator has signalled that the markets are becoming increasingly pessimistic about the future\u0026nbspof the US and UK economies.Market indicator that preceded last 7 US recessions flips againTraders and economists are concerned that that the yields are\u0026nbsphigher for short-term bonds than for bonds maturing further away in the future. That is unusual as investors generally want a larger return if they are going to lock their cash away for longer.The last time it happened in the US was in 2007.They are, effectively, the rates of annual interest paid out to investors by bonds.The yield on short-term US government bonds is normally well below the yield on equivalent long-term bonds. This results in an upward sloping “curve”, with bond yields gently rising as the redemption date of the bond stretches into the future.Sometimes the yield on short-term bonds rises, bringing short-term borrowing rates close to long-term rates, thus flattening the profile of the overall borrowing yield curve.And sometimes the yield on short-term bonds can even go higher than that of long-term bonds.This isn’t just a flattening, but an “inversion”.It implies first of all that investors, fearing for the future, are looking for safety. US stock markets have fallen sharply as risky assets like shares have been sold off in favour of bonds which are government-backed and pay a fixed return.It\u0026nbspalso signals that investors think a recession is due which would prompt central banks - in this case the Federal Reserve and Bank of England - to cut interest rates in the future.How concerned should we be?Major economic downturns in the US, but also in other advanced economies, have usually been preceded by this economic indicator.A recession in the US, the planet’s biggest economy, would inevitably hit the rest of the world, including the UK hard.But there have also been examples were the\u0026nbspyield curve inverted but no recession followed, such as in the UK in the early 2000s.In the past there has also been a significant lag of around 10 months to three years between this indicator and a subsequent recession.Why has this happened?News on both the UK and US economies has been pretty negative of late. Under Boris Johnson the risk of a no-deal Brexit has risen sharply and last week we learned that the UK economy had unexpectedly shrink in the last quarter. This week, inflation came in higher than expected.The US outlook is being damaged by trade tensions with China which have seen the Trump administration hit the majority of Chinese imports with tariffs. Beijing has responded in kind with its own tariffs on US imports.Marc Ostwald, chief economist at ADM Investor Services International, said the latest inversion of the yield curve said more about the global economy as a whole than the US in particular.“We are looking at Germany, we are looking at, above all, China and we are going, ‘This isn’t good, these are meant to be motors of global trade’.”China\u0027s latest figures show that industrial output grew much weaker than forecast.So how worried should we be?We should be wary, but not panicking.The US yield curve is not a failsafe predictor of recession. And there are various technical reasons why it may be distorted at the moment.Yet the voices arguing that the global financial system is not yet safe are credible and should be heeded\u0026nbspregardless of whether or not we are about to enter a new global recession.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Non-store retailing, which covers mostly online sales, jumped 6.9 per cent.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCompared with July 2018, overall sales grew 3.3 per cent, again boosted by online shopping. This was a smaller rise than in June but above economists’ expectations. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHowever, on the three-month measure, which strips out some of the volatility in the figures, sales ticked up only by 0.5 per cent from the February-April period. This was the slowest pace of growth since the end of last year.\u0026nbspDuncan Brewer, retail and consumer partner at Oliver Wyman, says there were two main drivers behind July’s retail sales: a record-breaking heatwave that kept shoppers away from bricks-and-mortar shops and heavy discounting online.\u0026nbspHe says:\u0026nbsp“Our research shows that 75 per cent of purchases during heavy discounting periods cannibalise full-price sales, as UK shoppers look to buy planned purchases rather than new, spontaneous products.”\u0026nbsp“Looking ahead, Brexit will be a major factor in consumer spending behaviour regardless of discounting. Shoppers will likely buy their Christmas shopping ahead of the 31 October deadline to avoid higher prices due to increased tariffs in the case of a no-deal Brexit.”Unlike farmers, British consumers seem to have been able to shrug off Brexit uncertainty, so far at least.\u0026nbspRanko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, on today\u0027s UK retail sales data:\u0026nbspIt would seem UK consumers still don’t give a fig about Brexit, and remain more than willing to spend their real wage increases. \u0026nbspThe report bodes well for a likely growth bump in Q3, as there are few signs that consumers are growing anywhere near as wary of no-deal as businesses.One argument for chlorinated poultry is that it is cheaper.\u0026nbspZippy Duvall of the\u0026nbspAmerican Farm Bureau told the BBC that the UK public should have the right to buy cheaper US produce if they wanted to.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspA lot of our farmers don\u0027t understand why other countries implement tariffs on our products but then they don\u0027t want us to implement any tariffs on our end, so we need to level that playing field, tear down all those barriers and let our people be able to make the choice of what food they want to eat and where it\u0027s grown at.Is US chicken really cheaper?\u0026nbspUsing US government data from 2015, a report\u0026nbspfrom free-market think tank, The Adam Smith Institute,\u0026nbspcalculated\u0026nbspthat US consumers pay 21 per cent less for a kilogram\u0026nbspof chicken than their counterparts in the UK.The think tank has therefore advocated negotiating a trade deal that would allow for imports of chlorine-treated meat. The ASI report does not provide evidence demonstrating a causal link between chlorine washing and cheaper poultry prices in supermarkets. Other factors could also be at play.\u0026nbspWho funds the Adam Smith Institute?

But reality is more complicatedClick to followThe IndependentIf Britain wants a trade deal with the US, it must accept American food standards, including those allowing genetic modification and chicken to be washed in chlorine, the head of America’s farming lobby has said.Both of those practices are controversial in the UK. Washing chicken carcasses in chlorinated water to kill off harmful bacteria is banned in the EU. And unlike the US, the EU has also not approved any fresh genetically modified (GM) fruit or vegetables for human consumption.But Zippy Duvall, head of the American Farm Bureau, said concerns over the practices are not “science-based”.“There is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash, just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away,” Mr Duvall, a poultry farmer in Georgia, told BBC Radio 4.“If there was something wrong with it, our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Created with Sketch.The exercise it takes to burn off high-calorie foods Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 calories310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 caloriesBoth the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the British Poultry Council have said eating meat treated in that way is safe.However, the EFSA opposes chlorine rinsing because it enables farmers to lower their standards of animal welfare and hygiene as they can simply use a chemical bath to kill off any harmful pathogens after animals are slaughtered.The EU takes what it calls an integrated approach to food safety, “from farm to fork covering all sectors of the food chain”. As part of that approach, there are minimum legal requirements for the amount of space, lighting and ventilation in EU poultry-rearing houses.As there are no laws governing this in the US, the birds can be crammed in tightly, according to Simon Dawson, a food safety expert at Cardiff politan University. This reduces production costs but increases the risks of disease and contamination in a flock.“Some US abattoirs and processing plants rely heavily on chlorination because their other hygiene standards are so poor that they would be illegal in Europe,” Mr Dawson wrote in 2017.“The process is also very good at removing odours and surface slime, meaning the meat can be passed off as fresh for much longer than it should be.”The EU is less strict on GM food, allowing some such products to be sold provided the EFSA has deemed them safe and they are labelled as GM.The World Health Organisation says it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM crops, and that each food should be assessed separately.Earlier this week, Donald Trump’s national security adviser said the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal with the US after Brexit.John Bolton suggested that the US could focus on striking bilateral trade deals in certain sectors like manufacturing and car-making and work out more complicated areas later.According to Mr Duvall, though, any trade agreement would have to include agriculture.“To have a trade treaty and not discuss agriculture would be turning your back on rural America and that’s where a big part of our population lives,” he said.A government spokesperson said: “Any future deal with the US must work for UK consumers, farmers and companies.\u0026nbsp“We have been clear on numerous occasions that we will not compromise on our high food or animal welfare standards as part of any trade deals.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

due in no small part to the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit and amplified by the impact of weather and tracking against national sporting events in the same period last year.As a result our non-food business has been challenged during the period, however we\u0027re satisfied that our food business has continued to perform well and our online growth continues to outpace the market.Despite all this, Asda\u0027s\u0026nbsptotal sales were up 1.3 per cent\u0026nbspIn the three months to 30 June.Good morning and welcome to The Independent\u0027s coverage of today\u0027s business and economic events.\u0026nbspMore than half of farms will go bust if\u0026nbspBoris Johnson\u0026nbspforces through a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit,\u0026nbspfarmers\u0026nbspare warning, as some join the campaign for a fresh referendum.A deadly cocktail of immediate\u0026nbsptariffs, border checks, increased red tape and cheaper food imports from outside the EU will result in the “decimation of UK farming”, a detailed study finds.Read the full story here from our deputy political editor Rob Merrick:Brexit: Farmers call for fresh referendum as they warn half of farms will go bust after no-deal exit\u0026nbspThe UK has been told by the American farming lobby that it must accept US standards such as allowing chlorinated chicken and the sale of genetically modified crops as part of a post-Brexit trade deal.\u0026nbspZippy Duval, head of the American Farm Bureau, told the BBC\u0026nbspthat fears about US practices were not science-based.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspYou know, here in America we treat our water with chlorine, Mr Duvall told the BBC\u0027s Today programme.So there is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away.If there was something wrong with it our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that, he added.The US has already laid out what it is looking for from a trade deal with the UK:\u0026nbsphttps:ustr.govsitesdefaultfilesSummary_of_U.S.-UK_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf\u0026nbspIt specifically does not like EU measures it deems to be not science-based.\u0026nbspIn trade speak:\u0026nbspObtain commitment that the UK will not foreclose export opportunities to the United States with respect to third-country export markets, including by requiring third countries to align with non-science based restrictions and requirements or to adopt SPS measures that are not based on ascertainable risk.\u0026nbspSPS measures  food hygiene standards\u0026nbspWorth noting that while US farmers may not believe a ban on chlorinated chicken is science-based, there are far more cases of salmonella per person in the US than in the UK.\u0026nbspNo-deal Brexit could force more than half of British farms out of business, farmers are warning.\u0026nbspWhy?\u0026nbsp* The EU, plus third countries with which it has trade agreements, would immediately slap tariffs on food exports from the UK.*\u0026nbspTariff-free imports of many agricultural products\u0026nbspwould have to be offered to non-EU countries as well, including the USA, Brazil and Australia – undermining domestic farming* It would also be hit by new non-tariff barriers, including administrative costs and border checks to ensure compliance with EU food safety and animal health regulations.* It would face an effective trade embargo on exports of animal-based products, while the UK and the EU negotiated an agreement.* The removal of support payments – with only a proportion likely to be covered by Whitehall – and an adverse trading environment will “render the majority of farm businesses unviable”.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the competition watchdog has called for the break-up of two recently-merged medical technology firms after finding the deal could lead to the NHS and charities paying higher prices.Sweden-based Tobii bought UK rival Smartbox for £11m last year, but the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has now ordered Tobii to sell off the business.The announcement comes after an investigation by independent CMA panel members concluded that the tie-up could result in a reduction in quality, less new product development, and higher prices.\u0026nbspPress AssociationIn the markets, the FTSE 100 has opened up 0.5\u0026nbspper cent down at 7,115.53.\u0026nbspTobacco companies are the biggest climbers, RBS and B\u0026ampQ owner Kingfisher are the worst performers.\u0026nbspEuropean stocks are stabilising after fears of a recession sparked a sell-off yesterday.UK retail sales grew in July, lifted by a surge in online sales, according to official data.\u0026nbspThe quantity bought last month rose 0.2 per cent compared with June, defying economists’ forecasts for a 0.2 per cent drop. Non-store retailing, which covers mostly online sales, jumped 6.9 per cent.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCompared with July 2018, overall sales grew 3.3 per cent, again boosted by online shopping. This was a smaller rise than in June but above economists’ expectations. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHowever, on the three-month measure, which strips out some of the volatility in the figures, sales ticked up only by 0.5 per cent from the February-April period. This was the slowest pace of growth since the end of last year.\u0026nbspDuncan Brewer, retail and consumer partner at Oliver Wyman, says there were two main drivers behind July’s retail sales: a record-breaking heatwave that kept shoppers away from bricks-and-mortar shops and heavy discounting online.\u0026nbspHe says:\u0026nbsp“Our research shows that 75 per cent of purchases during heavy discounting periods cannibalise full-price sales, as UK shoppers look to buy planned purchases rather than new, spontaneous products.”\u0026nbsp“Looking ahead, Brexit will be a major factor in consumer spending behaviour regardless of discounting. Shoppers will likely buy their Christmas shopping ahead of the 31 October deadline to avoid higher prices due to increased tariffs in the case of a no-deal Brexit.”Unlike farmers, British consumers seem to have been able to shrug off Brexit uncertainty, so far at least.\u0026nbspRanko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, on today\u0027s UK retail sales data:\u0026nbspIt would seem UK consumers still don’t give a fig about Brexit, and remain more than willing to spend their real wage increases. \u0026nbspThe report bodes well for a likely growth bump in Q3, as there are few signs that consumers are growing anywhere near as wary of no-deal as businesses.One argument for chlorinated poultry is that it is cheaper.\u0026nbspZippy Duvall of the\u0026nbspAmerican Farm Bureau told the BBC that the UK public should have the right to buy cheaper US produce if they wanted to.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspA lot of our farmers don\u0027t understand why other countries implement tariffs on our products but then they don\u0027t want us to implement any tariffs on our end, so we need to level that playing field, tear down all those barriers and let our people be able to make the choice of what food they want to eat and where it\u0027s grown at.Is US chicken really cheaper?\u0026nbspUsing US government data from 2015, a report\u0026nbspfrom free-market think tank, The Adam Smith Institute,\u0026nbspcalculated\u0026nbspthat US consumers pay 21 per cent less for a kilogram\u0026nbspof chicken than their counterparts in the UK.The think tank has therefore advocated negotiating a trade deal that would allow for imports of chlorine-treated meat. The ASI report does not provide evidence demonstrating a causal link between chlorine washing and cheaper poultry prices in supermarkets. Other factors could also be at play.\u0026nbspWho funds the Adam Smith Institute? No one knows because they won\u0027t tell anyone.TSB has apologised yet again after more problems with its online banking and mobile app.\u0026nbspCustomers would not get into their accounts between 4am and 7am on Thursday morning after problems with routine maintenance.\u0026nbspTSB\u0027s suffered a disastrous IT meldown last year which caused many people to lose access to online banking services.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn\u0027s plan to bring down Boris Johnson with a no-confidence vote is boosting the pound.\u0026nbspSterling is up 0.64 per cent against the dollar to $1.2136\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspand 0.5 per cent against the euro to €1.088 so far.\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspsays it will attempt to bring down\u0026nbspBoris Johnson\u0027s government within days\u0026nbspof MPs returning to parliament after the summer recess, in an effort to stop a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit.Senior frontbencher\u0026nbspRebecca Long-Bailey\u0026nbspmade the remarks as\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn\u0026nbspdelivered a\u0026nbspdramatic offer to be caretaker prime minister\u0026nbspand secure a Brexit extension if he is successful in toppling Mr Johnson.More from Ashley Cowburn:Labour to attempt to bring down Boris Johnson\u0027s government within \u0027days\u0027 of parliament resuming\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf Britain wants a trade deal with the US, it must accept American food standards, including those allowing genetic modification and chicken to be washed in chlorine, the head of America’s farming lobby has said.Both of those practices are controversial in the UK. Washing chicken carcasses in chlorinated water to kill off harmful bacteria is banned in the EU.\u0026nbspFull story here, from Olesya Dmitracova:\u0026nbspUK told to accept US food standards in any trade deal, including chlorination and GM\u0026nbspChina has threatened retaliation if Washington steps up its war over trade and technology by going ahead with planned 1 September tariff hikes on additional Chinese imports.\u0026nbspBeijing will take unspecified necessary countermeasures, the Cabinet said in a one-sentence statement.

Apple could stick with the roman numerals and name the new phone XI, for instance, or could drop the numbers in the same way as it did with the iPads.But a new series of reports suggest that the new phones could actually be called the iPhone 11.

It is in keeping with a whole host of reports, however, many of which have discussed the possible Pro branding.Using the Pro name would bring the phones in line with the iPad, Mac and MacBook, all of which use the word to mark out the most high-performance and high-price versions.Case companies often act on leaks from within Apple\u0027s supply chain, as they rush to get their products ready for the launch of new phones, meaning that their designs can often be an early indication of the details of unreleased products. But they have been known to be wrong in the past, especially with the naming and branding of products, which can be changed at the last moment.Apple is expected to unveil the new phones in the second week of September, at a media event that will be broadcast around the world. All three of the phones are then expected to arrive around two weeks later.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This coincided with the spread of anatomically modern humans in Europe\u0026nbspand pre-dated climate cooling.“Our study supports a potential significant human role in the general extinction and local extirpation of the European cave bear and illuminates the fate of this megafauna species, the authors wrote.\u0026nbspResearchers led by Verena Schuenemann from the University of Zurich and Herve Bocherens, from the University of Tubingenand,\u0026nbspreconstructed 59 cave bear mitochondrial genomes from bone.The samples were collected across 14 sites in Switzerland, Poland, France, Spain, Germany, Italy and Serbia.Belgrad.

Many dressed themselves in white as a symbol of peace. Some took picnics. This, organisers said, was to be a show of numbers not of force or revolutionary intent. But they were met with unforgiving brutality rarely used before in England and never known since.“Mounds of human being remained where they had fallen, crushed down and smothered,” wrote one attendee Samuel Bamford in the aftermath. “Confusion and terror,” reported the Manchester Chronicle simply.Peterloo review: Mike Leigh’s period drama has immediacy and anger“What unfolded,” says Professor Robert Poole today, “was so shocking that the consequences of that afternoon continue to reverberate even in 2019. It was the one big event that set the foundation for the democracy we still have.”The Peterloo massacre has not always been considered of such historical importance. Many 20th-century scholars dismissed it as a localised event only: trouble up north, if you will.But as the bicentenary is marked on Friday with events across the UK – including an unveiling of the first monument to the massacre in Manchester – many analysts have started to note similarities between then and now: a polarised society, gaping inequalities, heated rhetoric, and a parliament apparently incapable of comprehending, let alone delivering on, the will of the people.“Certainly, there are political parallels, and lessons we can learn,” says Poole, whose book Peterloo: The English Uprising, is perhaps the definitive text on the event. “What it’s worth saying is that the people in the crowd that day, the radicals and reformers, were supporting a populist movement – and, clearly, they had history on their side. What that shows – and I’m not a Brexiteer – is that populism, left or right, should not automatically be dismissed as ignorant. Popular opinion must be understood and accommodated.”Yet Peterloo was far more than some vague Brexit parallel.It was, in fact, says Poole, the beginning of a journey to the modern political rights we enjoy, as a country, today.“Britain has this history of gradual political reform from 1832 onwards,” he says. “So Peterloo, coming 13 years before that, is often seen to have failed in bringing change. But in fact, this was the great shock that paved the way for everything that followed.”Janette Martin with items from the John Rylands Library Peterloo exhibition (Jill Jennings)On that sunny Monday afternoon, an estimated 60,000 people from towns across Lancashire had descended on Manchester’s St Peter’s Field – more or less where the city’s Central Convention Complex stands today – to listen to the famed speaker Henry Hunt.They came demonstrating because they were hungry and suffering: the infamous Corn Laws had made bread almost unaffordable to large swathes of the population, while the onset of the industrial revolution had simultaneously driven wages down.But this crowd was not asking for food or better pay. They saw systemic change as the path to betterment. They demanded greater representation in parliament. A few called for that most obscure of dreams in an age where just 400,000 men had the vote: full universal suffrage.Just as pertinently, perhaps, it was a movement that came to St Peter’s Fields in peace.Such was the expectation of a pleasant day that when the first wave of yeomanry arrived a cheer went up for their bright colours.“Then,” wrote Bamford of the appearance of these horsemen, “waving their sabres over their heads, and slackening rein, and striking spur into their steeds, they dashed forward and began cutting the people.”The sheer size of the demonstration had, it seemed, spooked Manchester’s loyalist magistrates. They had ordered the 1,600 yeomanry, special constables and army hussars – all waiting nearby in case of trouble – to disperse the people and arrest Hunt.The troops followed their orders with something approaching “glee”, says Poole.“They treated the crowd like you would treat an enemy in the battlefield – right to the point that they seized their banners as you would take an enemy’s flag,” adds the professor.It was all over within half an hour and within days had become known as Peterloo. The nickname – referencing the Battle of Waterloo – was given because those there said it was like being caught in the middle of a war.Yet if the authorities achieved their hollow victory in the short term – Hunt and other organisers were arrested and jailed – such was the horror of the day that it would ultimately spur the cause of reform.Peterloo’ is based on the Manchester masscre (Amazon Studios)By 1832, support had grown to such an extent that parliament finally passed the Great Reform Act, which, while a long way from meeting all radical demands, was a first significant step towards a modern democracy. It increased the electorate by almost 50 per cent to 650,000 men and laid the ideological groundwork for a universal suffrage that would finally come, following several incremental steps, by 1928.Crucially, it looked at one point like the 1832 bill may be rejected by the House of Lords. Protests were organised across England. The country held its breath amid suggestions troops would be sent to disperse such gatherings.And, then, the Lords backed down.“Sending in armed troops against unarmed demonstrators after Peterloo was almost unthinkable,” says Poole. “And it has remained that way ever since. Clearly, there have been times, such as Orgreave when the state has deployed excessive force against protestors. But the consensus that using armed force against civilians is not accepted in this county dates back to Peterloo.”Just last year, while promoting his film about that fateful day, the director Mike Leigh called for schools to teach it as part of their history curriculums, a plea that is now gaining some support.“It has very much become part of the national\u0026nbspconsciousness over the last few years,” says Poole. “Now, we must ensure it stays there. It is too important to be forgotten.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Why can’t he deliver that promise rather than the disaster of a no-mandate\u0026nbspno deal?”And Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “A no-deal Brexit must be taken off the table.

But reality is more complicatedClick to followThe IndependentIf Britain wants a trade deal with the US, it must accept American food standards, including those allowing genetic modification and chicken to be washed in chlorine, the head of America’s farming lobby has said.Both of those practices are controversial in the UK. Washing chicken carcasses in chlorinated water to kill off harmful bacteria is banned in the EU. And unlike the US, the EU has also not approved any fresh genetically modified (GM) fruit or vegetables for human consumption.But Zippy Duvall, head of the American Farm Bureau, said concerns over the practices are not “science-based”.“There is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash, just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away,” Mr Duvall, a poultry farmer in Georgia, told BBC Radio 4.“If there was something wrong with it, our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Created with Sketch.The exercise it takes to burn off high-calorie foods Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 calories310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 caloriesBoth the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the British Poultry Council have said eating meat treated in that way is safe.However, the EFSA opposes chlorine rinsing because it enables farmers to lower their standards of animal welfare and hygiene as they can simply use a chemical bath to kill off any harmful pathogens after animals are slaughtered.The EU takes what it calls an integrated approach to food safety, “from farm to fork covering all sectors of the food chain”. As part of that approach, there are minimum legal requirements for the amount of space, lighting and ventilation in EU poultry-rearing houses.As there are no laws governing this in the US, the birds can be crammed in tightly, according to Simon Dawson, a food safety expert at Cardiff politan University. This reduces production costs but increases the risks of disease and contamination in a flock.“Some US abattoirs and processing plants rely heavily on chlorination because their other hygiene standards are so poor that they would be illegal in Europe,” Mr Dawson wrote in 2017.“The process is also very good at removing odours and surface slime, meaning the meat can be passed off as fresh for much longer than it should be.”The EU is less strict on GM food, allowing some such products to be sold provided the EFSA has deemed them safe and they are labelled as GM.The World Health Organisation says it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM crops, and that each food should be assessed separately.Earlier this week, Donald Trump’s national security adviser said the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal with the US after Brexit.John Bolton suggested that the US could focus on striking bilateral trade deals in certain sectors like manufacturing and car-making and work out more complicated areas later.According to Mr Duvall, though, any trade agreement would have to include agriculture.“To have a trade treaty and not discuss agriculture would be turning your back on rural America and that’s where a big part of our population lives,” he said.A government spokesperson said: “Any future deal with the US must work for UK consumers, farmers and companies.\u0026nbsp“We have been clear on numerous occasions that we will not compromise on our high food or animal welfare standards as part of any trade deals.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was unclear if the US\u0026nbsphad forwarded the warrant.\u0026nbspThe tanker\u0026nbspand its 2.1 million tons of Iranian light crude oil\u0026nbspremained still in waters off Gibraltar a day after authorities ended its detention for allegedly breaching European Union sanctions on Syria.\u0026nbspThe release\u0026nbspcame over the objections of the United States.

More recently, the Persian Gulf has seen attacks on oil tankers and other high-stakes confrontations.\u0026nbspIn early July, Tehran seized the British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero in apparent retaliation for the detention of the Grace 1.\u0026nbspA lawyer representing three Grace 1 crew members who were released from detention on Thursday, have cast\u0026nbspdoubt on the vessel\u0027s immediate departure.\u0026nbspThe Iranian tanker row has left everyone with a win – except the USRichard Wilkinson said\u0026nbspthat the Indian national who commanded the oil tanker until it was detained in early July had asked his Iranian employers to replace him.\u0026nbspHe doesn\u0027t want to stay in command of the ship, he wants to go home, because he wasn\u0027t happy to go back and pick up the broken pieces, Mr Wilkinson said. But he\u0027s a professional skipper and needs to wait for a new crew to do a proper handover.\u0026nbspThe tanker had been due for repairs in Gibraltar even before it was seized and its detention impeded the replacement of parts, making the tanker unfit for an immediate long voyage, he added.\u0026nbspIranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Abbas Mousavi said that his country had made no commitments to gain the release of its tanker, while the chief minister of Gibraltar,\u0026nbspFabian\u0026nbspPicardo,\u0026nbspinsisted on written assurances were received.\u0026nbspShe is able to leave as soon as she organises the logistics necessary in order to sail a ship of that size wherever it is going next, he\u0026nbsptold the BBC. It could be today. It could be tomorrow. This is a matter now exclusively for the ship agents and ship owners.\u0026nbspThe US\u0026nbspgovernment said it had obtained a warrant to seize the tanker, citing violations of American\u0026nbspsanctions, as well as money laundering and terrorism statutes.\u0026nbspIn court documents unsealed in Washington, the US\u0026nbspalleges a complex scheme to unlawfully access the American\u0026nbspfinancial system in order to support shipments to Syria by Iran\u0027s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which has been designated as a foreign terrorist organisation.\u0026nbspThe complaint alleges that people associated with the ship provided fraudulent shipping documents had obtained oil and departed from an Iraqi shipping port. The US\u0026nbspsays the documents were forced to mask the fact that the ship had actually departed from Iran.\u0026nbspA senior administration official said the Justice Department\u0027s complaint provides additional details associating the ship with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its support for terrorism.\u0026nbspAssociated Press contributed to this report.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There were security checkpoints in every city centre street, bag searches in most shops.In my teenage years, when I attended school in the west of Ulster, one of my fellow pupils was killed in the infamous IRA bomb attack on Lord Mountbatten’s boat off the Irish coast in .Two years later, the terrorist and hunger striker Bobby Sands was briefly my MP before his self-inflicted death, an event that provoked more rioting.Despite the ruthlessness of the IRA, the British security forces never wavered in their duty.Even in the face of mortal danger from petrol bombs, stones and even bullets, the soldiers did not buckle.In the cauldron of historic animosities, stoked by the venom of the IRA, they showed impressive forbearance, undermining the Republican propaganda about British oppression.There were disastrous failures, however, like the loss of discipline at Bloody Sunday in Derry, , when British paratroopers fired on a group of protesters, killing  of them.Over the years, their tenacity gradually wore down the enemy, particularly through the use of sophisticated military intelligence.Towards the end of the s, the entire IRA network was riddled with British agents.Even Frank Scappaticci, the Republicans’ own head of its feared Internal Security Unit – known as the “Nutting Squad” - was alleged to be an informer.Such deep penetration made it almost impossible for the IRA to carry on using the bomb and the bullet effectively .By the close of the Troubles, British security forces were estimated to be foiling two out of every three planned IRA operations.One former IRA man, now a Dublin solicitor, admitted, “It was a complete and utter defeat, absolutely.”It was a defeat that heralded a new era in Northern Ireland.In practice, the peace process was a declaration of surrender by the IRA.Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness did not suddenly see the light and become peaceniks.They embraced democratic politics because they recognised that their terror movement, beaten by the British forces, could no longerproperly.After the Good Friday Agreement of , the Republicans agreed to decommission their weapons without achieving any of their key political aims. Northern Ireland remains in the United Kingdom, while the partition of Ireland continues.For political reasons, the British army has never received the credit it deserves for its remarkable victory.In the new climate of co-operation, there is an understandable wish to avoid any triumphalism.But what is reprehensible is the persistent hounding of British veterans who bravely served their country in the Troubles, but are now the subject of official inquiries into past misconduct.No fewer than  of these veterans are said to be currently under investigation, despite endless pledges from politicians about an end to the grotesque witch-hunts.The gross betrayal of their service is bad enough, but even more offensive are the double-standards, for the Good Friday Agreement facilitated the early release of scores of terrorists, as well an amnesty for many on the run.If the peace process is meant to draw a line in the sand about Ulster’s dark past, it should apply to everyone.Thanks in large part to the efforts of the British army, the future should be bright for Northern Ireland.But clouds are gathering, due to suspension of the devolved assembly and concerns about a hard border because of Brexit.The fragility of the situation means that British politicians should tread carefully, respecting the rights of both communities in the province, as well as the interests of Dublin, our closest neighbour.But the Tories have done anything but that.Having thrown away their majority in , they have formed a dubious alliance with the DUP, a reactionary outfit which presents itself as the voice of Ulster but in fact won only  per cent of the vote at the last election.As cheerleaders for unionism, the Conservatives now talk about “our precious union”, while regrettably Boris Johnson has even given himself the additional title of “Minister for the Union.”Whilst many Brits feel passionate about keeping the union together, this rhetoric may not be what Northern Ireland needs.The British Government is meant to be an honest broker rather than a partisan advocate for one side.“Rigorous impartiality” was central to the success of the Good Friday Agreement. For the sake of harmony, that spirit cannot be allowed to disappear.The campaign in Northern Ireland may not have had the glamour of victories like Egypts El Alamein or Waterloo, but it was still one of the British army’s greatest achievements.It would be a tragedypast military determination were to be squandered by present political bungling.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It wasn’t fake fur at all,” the trader said.“It looked like he needed to be dusted.”And the tiger, the trader said, “was huge.”“I don’t think the pictures really give proper dimensions,” he said.“The desk had to be one of the biggest desks I’ve ever seen, and that tiger just dwarfed it.”The trader said he was ushered out of Epstein’s office after about  minutes and brought to a nondescript waiting room before being introduced to the financier.“I remember he had a really hot secretary and he came off with a lot of bravado,” the trader said.But while Epstein was “very enthusiastic during the presentation,” he never followed up afterward, despite the fact that he heard pitches from a group of hedge funders who offered “four dferent strategies and styles.”“There were some really quality guys that we put before him,” the trader said.“It makes me think – just purely speculation – that they weren’t really trading, just pretending to trade.” The paedophile banker, , died from hanging last Saturday in his jail cell while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges.Since his arrest and suicide, Epstein’s New York townhouse has become a dark tourism attraction with people posing for pictures outside the Upper East Side property.Earlier this week, it was revealed that the disgraced financier kept a bizarre painting of former US President Bill Clinton wearing a blue dress.A version of this story originally appeared on The New York Post."},{"url":null,"title":"big fat gypsy wedding star paddy doherty connors budd sentence","story":"Billy Budd, , ploughed into Michael ‘Mikey’ Connors, , who was riding in a horse and cart on the A Eastern Way dual carriageway in Thamesmead, London in July , killing him and his horse.Mr Connors, dubbed ‘King of the Road,’ died at the scene from severe head injuries and his £, prize horse Tony Montana, had to be put down on the road after the car crushed its back and pelvis.Budd attempted to flee the scene but was chased by a witness who forced him into the central reservation and then called the cops.Several members of Mr Connors’ family were at Southwark Crown Court today for sentencing and the family clutched a large photo of their loved one surrounded by clouds and rays.After the judge had passed sentence a female family member of Mr Connors approached and Budd and told him: “You killed my brother.”Prosecutor Philip Stott said at about .am a witness was travelling in front of the defendants BMW and recalled one or two cars moved to overtake the horse and cart.He said: He estimates that the defendants BMW was about - car s directly behind him.He saw the defendants vehicle still in the same lane moving in on the cart and not performing an overtaking manoeuvre.Another witness saw the crash and said Budd was travelling  to mph faster than Mikey and travelling in a straight line for at least  seconds before.Mr Stott continued: Instead of overtaking, the defendants vehicle instead collided directly with the rear of the deceaseds cart.The cart went up in air as the BMW collided with it. Mr Connors moved over the top of the BMW and suffered a head injury either from he roofline or the road surface as he fell back down.The horse suffered serious injury to its back and pelvis as a result of the direct impact from the BMW into its rear.The BMW sustained crumpling and denting along its nearside and up to the windscreen consistent with running into the rear of the cart and horse.Budd then swerved into the right-hand lane and overtook the first witness as the second witness then chased the BMW to force the vehicle into the median strip of the dual-carriageway, the court heard.Mr Stott said: The witness shouted at the defendant do you know what youve done, youve killed somebody, go back.The defendant appeared confused and shaken. The second witness told the defendant to park his car and go back, which he did.Budd, who has worked at Belmarsh Prison since he was  and was described by friends as a sensitive man, did not initially identy himself as the driver of the vehicle to police, but as a witness.When he was approached again by an officer he then identied himself as the driver where he was arrested, cautioned, and transported to Plumstead Police Station.Mr Stott told the court: He said that he moved across to the left hand lane because he knew that the lanes merged ahead.He stated that as he did so another vehicle in front of him in the left hand lane moved into the right-hand lane, in effect swapping lanes.The defendant suggested that manoeuvre must have obscured the cart from view, with the cart becoming only evident to him immediately before what he stated was an unavoidable collision.He said that he had told police he was a witness at first due to the large number of members of the deceaseds community that had gathered at the scene.A statement by Mikeys we Elizabeth, read by Mr Stott, said: My world has been turned upside down.In a letter to the Connors family, Budd wrote: Im so sorry to the Connors family. I cannot begin to imagine how hard this has been for them. I also feel remorse for the horse as well.My heart breaks for his family and friends and I often wish it had been me who died.Defending, Dickon Reid said: He is a sensitive man, a kind-hearted man, not a jack the lad.Judge Joanna Korner said: “I describe this as a tragic case. It could be said that all such cases of this kind fall into that category.“His death had been devastating for the whole family. His mother described him as the organiser of the family whose siblings relied on.“It is right to say that any sentence passed on the man responsible for bringing about this situation cannot regrettably change the reality or the loss that Mr Connors family is suffering.“What caused this accident was clearly the defendant becoming distracted by something, nobody knows - least of all him, so that he utterly failed to see Mr Connors.“Remorse is the strongest mitigating factors and in this case there is no doubt in my judgement that this defendant is deeply and genuinely remorseful.“Its remorse, in my judgement, not brought about by self pity but because he does understand what he has done to the Connors family.”The court heard how Mr Budd, who bowed his head, while his sentence was handed down, had a personality change since the crash - becoming withdrawn and depressed young man to the extent that he is on medication.A probation report read by the judge recommended not sending him to prison.It said: There is nothing the court can do to Mr Budd that will punish him more than he is already punishing himself as he relives the events of that day.It would serve to exacerbate the problems and increase the risk of him committing suicide.Mr Budd was ordered to complete two  month long community orders requiring him to complete  hours of unpaid work for causing death by dangerous driving and  hours for damaging property, in respect to the horse.Both are to run at the same time.He was also disqualied from driving for two years.More than  mourners gathered to remember the dad-of-two at his burial place at Epsom Cemetery, near the race course that hosts the Derby last month.Speaking at that anniversary Paddy, who won Celebrity Big Brother in , said: Mikey was a great man. He was an all rounder. he was a worker, he was a horseman and a gentleman as well.Even the horse game has gone down hill since hes gone because of the tragedy - every traveller in the world it has affected.There was a horse competition in Dublin in January just for him, because he was popular, he was a legend.He was more than one in a billion, he was one in a trillion."},{"url":null,"title":"luxurious superyacht jeff bezos flying fox","story":"The Flying Fox was once rumoured to have been bought by Jeff Bezos, the boss of Amazon and the world’s wealthiest man.Despite his . billion fortune, Bezos hadn’t actually bought the ft vessel and instead was merely renting it out on a trip to Turkey.It reportedly costs a cool £. million a week to hire.The Flying Fox has  cabins with private sea view terraces that can sleep up to  guests as well as a -seat dining table and two-floor salon with a working fireplace.It comes with  sq ft, two floor spa which offers guests offering guests a massage area, gym and cryo sauna.The cabins include a master suite on the upper deck with a private Jacuzzi.Guests can also enjoy the ft swimming pool and cinema as well as observation room where they can soak in a hot tub and take in the view.A crew of  means there are at least two staffers for each of the guests.Getting to the boat can also be done in a manner befitting its super-rich guests and its two helipads are capable of hosting the world’s largest helicopters.Flying Fox has nine tenders as well as jet skis, sea bobs, fly boards and hover boards.The boat is being leaded by charter company Imperial whose director Julia Stewart described it as “unprecedented” and “a beauty”.Despite its huge size, the Flying Fox isn’t the world’s largest yacht but is instead th in the league table.Cheslea owner Roman Abramovich’s £m superyacht Eclipse, which is equipped with a missile defence system and submarine, is secondHis vessel was the world’s largest until the launch of the ft-long Azzam, which cost its owner Khala bin Zayed al-Nayan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi just under £ million."},{"url":null,"title":"girl found chewing mdma capsule in playground","story":"The girl’s mum spoke of her horror after her daughter narrowly avoided swallowing the drug at the children’s park in Australia on Wednesday morning.The panicked mother took to Reddit, writing: Just caught my one-year-old child picking this up of the grass and putting it in her mouth in Kalinga Park this morning!A photo of the capsule was posted alongside the post, revealing the suspicious rock crystals inside.She alerted nearby Hendra Police Station and officers took to the Brisbane park to search for further discarded drugs.Reddit users were quick to express their concern with comments pointing out that the child could have diedshe swallowed the capsule.One user wrote: “That’s scary, can’t imagine a  year old’s brain or heart would respond well to that.”Some targeted the owner of the drug for putting the child at risk.Another mother said: Wow thats awful.

as spiders believe its already autumn.Spiders usually seek shelter in warm places during September, but frantic homeowners across the country are already spotting the creepy crawlies in their homes.Central heating provides the perfect conditions for the females to lay their eggs, and the summer deluge has tricked the spiders into thinking its already mating season.This summer has been a weather whirlwind for Britain - as the hottest July ever was recorded, swtly followed by one of the wettest Augusts on record.The hottest day EVER was recorded this July, as mercury reached a sweltering .C in Cambridge.However, the warm weather didnt last long - as August brought downpours, severe weather warnings, and is now on track to be the wettest August on record.The dramatic weather change has caused confusion for the eight-legged creatures, bringing them into our homes sooner than expected.Pest controller Clive Boase has also warned of a rise in  widows — the UKs only native poisonous spider, which have shiny black bodies.He said: “They’re more common than most people think.There are half-a-dozen dferent species of the  widow and they can survive both indoors and outdoors.They prefer suburban areas and are most commonly found around domestic and commercial premises.They love conservatories and toilet blocks, window frames, porches, lofts and garages and they like to live beneath kitchen appliances and cupboards.“They certainly can give a painful bite but only as a last resort.”"},{"url":null,"title":"cycling leave women struggling to orgasm no satisfaction between sheets","story":"It revealed that  per cent of female cyclists reported bedroom issues, including loss of desire, lower satisfaction and dficulty reaching orgasm.That compares to rates of sexual dys in the general population of around  per cent.US research involving  women cyclists with an average age of  found nearly seven out of ten were left saddle sore, with pain or numbness to their genitals.The effects were shown to last up to a week.Doctors think sitting in the saddle blocks blood flow to vital organs and traps key nerves.Writing in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, lead researcher Daniel Greenberg from Stanford University, Calornia, said: “We found genital pain and numbness from cycling were strongly associated with both decreased arousal and satisfaction with orgasm.“This suggests that repeated interruptions of blood flow or nerve entrapment can decrease genital sensation and increase odds of sexual dys.”Fewer than three per cent of the participants were professional cyclists.Those who used wider saddles were  per cent less likely to suffer pain, experts found.Cycling has been linked to erectile problems in men, but until now there has been little research on its effects on women.Prof Raj Persad, consultant urologist with Bristol Urology Associates, said: “Spreading the pressure points over a larger area, by using a wider seat, and reducing time in the saddle would seem to be good advice.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His purple, bloated face was captured by a photographer as paramedics rushed him to a New York hospital.Hours later, The Bureau of Prisons said he had died “from an apparent suicide”. His death came just over a month after he stepped off his private jet in New Jersey and was arrested by FBI agents. Epstein was charged with child sex trafficking offences.Prosecutors said the disgraced financier – jailed in  on child prostitution charges – had abused “dozens” of girls as young as . Victims revealed he would lure them to his home on the premise of giving him massages for money – before sexually abusing them behind closed doors.Judge Richard Berman denied Epstein bail – preventing him from plotting his defence from within the walls of his £million New York mansion.Speculation had turned to whether the ex-investment banker might co-operate with authorities. Big-name friends and associates might have had to give evidence – or be the subject of incriminating testimony from the girls Epstein allegedly abused.THE politan Correctional Center in the heart of Manhattan, New York, has been described as a “mini Guantanamo Bay” because it is so tough.It has formerly housed terrorists and Mexican drug lord El Chapo. Inmates in the jail’s Special Housing Unit where Epstein was held are kept in their tiny cells for  hours a day with the lights on at all times.Prisoners are only rarely allowed outside – in a cage on the roof. The notorious unit is said to be infested with rats and cockroaches. One former inmate at the prison, right, told the New York Post that it would have been “impossible” for Epstein to have hanged himself in his cell.He said: “You have sheets, but they’re paper level, not strong enough. He was  lbs – it would never happen.”ON July  –  days before his death – Epstein had been found curled up in the fetal position on the floor of his cell. One witness said he was “blue in the face” with bruising around his neck. Prison bosses suspected a suicide attempt.But they launched a probe to seehe had been attacked and even quizzed ex-cop Nicholas Tartaglione locked up in the jail on suspicion of killing four men. Another source said the incident could have been a ploy to get Epstein moved to a cushier jail.He was placed on suicide watch. Such prisoners are monitored. But just six days later – on July  – Epstein was taken off suicide watch. One source said Epstein’s lawyers asked for the change.He was put back in the Special Housing Unit and downgraded to “special observation status”, requiring two guards to check on him separately every  minutes. Epstein was also supposed to have a cell mate but was alone the night before he was found dead.His two guards reportedly fell asleep and failed to check on him. They also falsied records to cover up their error, sources told the New York Times. Both guards were working overtime. One was not even a corrections officer at the short-staffed jail.It was not the first time that the authorities had failed Epstein’s victims. His  conviction had been extremely lenient. Last year, it emerged that the US Attorney’s Office scrapped a -page indictment against Epstein, allowing him to plead guilty to minor state prostitution charges.He served  months in the private wing of a county jail and spent most of that on work release. Alex Acosta, who handled Epstein’s plea deal, resigned last month as US President Donald Trump’s Labor Secretary in the wake of the scandal.EPSTEIN had apparently hanged himself with a bedsheet. The office of New York City’s chief medical examiner, Barbara Sampson, completed an autopsy of Epstein’s body on Sunday.She found that he had suffered multiple breaks in his neck bones, deepening the mystery. Among them was the hyoid bone which is near the Adam’s apple. Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves but they are far more common in victims of murder by strangulation.Sampson listed the cause of his death as pending and is seeking further information. But authorities are still said to be confident that Epstein killed himself.IN the s, Prince Andrew was introduced to Epstein by British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. The Duke of York, now , went to his private Caribbean island and attended celeb-filled dinner parties with Woody Allen at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion.In a  court affidavit, Epstein’s ex-masseuse Virginia Roberts claimed she was lent out to Prince Andrew for sex as a teen. A picture also emerged of Andrew with his arm round Virginia, then , in . Andrew has always vigorously denied the claims which were later struck from a court case by a judge.A statement from Buckingham Palace said: “It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.

Clinton recently said he and Epstein hadn’t spoken in “well over a decade”.US President Donald Trump re-tweeted a conspiracy theory that Clinton had Epstein killed. In , Trump praised Epstein, both inset: “He likes beautul women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”FOLLOWING his death, the criminal case against Epstein can no longer be pursued. But victims will now launch legal claims against his estate for a slice of his fortune.Jenner Araoz, , became the first to sue this week. She said she was just  when Epstein raped her. US Attorney General Bill Barr has also vowed to hunt down others involved with Epstein’s sex trafficking conspiracy.Investigators are thought to be focusing on allegations regarding his ex-lover Ghislaine Maxwell, . She has been accused of procuring underage girls for him. Maxwell has denied the claims. The elusive former socialite sold her New York townhouse in .She was spotted for the first time on Monday at a fast food joint in LA, reading a book titled The Secret Lives And Deaths Of CIA Operatives. Others accused of aiding Epstein include assistants Sarah Kellen, Lesley Groff, Nadia Marcinkova and Adriana Ross, who are alleged to have booked his massages with young girls.Those four were named in Epstein’s  prostitution case as “potential co-conspirators” – which saw him jailed but then go free.

Here was her chance to pay back Andrew for his years of support and to cement their status as a reunited couple.A senior royal insider says: “She wants to be his shoulder to cry on. She wants to be there for him in his hour of need.“She feels this is like the old days when they would take on the world together.”Behind the scenes, the Royal Family and staff, who call the pair the “royal odd couple”, are shocked by the twists and turns of the embattled twosome. Some courtiers are even asking the previously unthinkable question: Could Andrew and Fergie go public as a couple They are now not seeing anybody  and are desperate to keep their rekindled relationship under wraps.Indeed, for the visit to Balmoral last week, they flew there separately to avoid being pictured together.The charade saw Andrew take his private jet, while Fergie landed a day later on a commercial flight ahead of their daughters Beatrice and Eugenie.The Queen’s insistence on having them both there is a sign that she has given their relationship her approval and now sees them as a reunited family.This gives Fergie further confidence that she can re-establish herself in the royal fold.But despite being together privately, two pivotal figures in the Royal Family are putting the brakes on them going public — Prince Philip and future king Prince Charles.The staunch opposition has led to friends of Sarah and Andrew, both , having ided opinions about where the relationship is heading in the long term.Many feel the prospect of remarrying remains unlikely while Philip is around, despite his hostility towards Fergie thawing.Another royal insider says: “They could never remarry while Prince Philip is alive.“He is dead against Sarah and blames her for bringing shame on the royals in the Nineties.“He still won’t be in the same room as herhe can help it, but made an exception for the royal weddings last year.“The Queen has always had a soft spot for Sarah and says she has been a wonderful mother to Beatrice and Eugenie.“She accepts that they have turned out well because their parents have been together in all but name.”A major moment of national sadness could provide Fergie’s biggest window of opportunity.The insider adds: “When Philip has gone, it wouldn’t surprise methey remarry.“They have both been through a lot and many relationships but there is something between them, an unbreakable bond which keeps them close. It’s a shame they broke up in the first place.”But another royal source has a dferent take: “I don’t think they will ever remarry. The truth is that it suits Sarah to stay friendly with Andrew and it always has done.“He has bailed her out financially on numerous occasions. She would be broke without him. Her trouble is she is actually very generous,perhaps based on insecurity.“As soon as she has any money she buys people presents and it’s almost asshe’s buying love and affection.”Fergie has remained close to another former lover, the millionaire motorsports businessman Paddy McNally who was her first serious boyfriend. So an attachment to an ex is nothing new.But Philip does not understand why The Duke of York has never been able to distance himself from his ex-we.The source adds: “Fergie does exert some sort of hold over him however, and he seems too weak to let go.“Their daughters are now grown up, so they don’t have to live together. But he seems incapable of splitting up totally, which dismays Prince Philip, who can’t understand the set-up.“It’s been like this for years and I don’t see it changing any time soon.”Prince Charles is opposed to the idea of Fergie rejoining “the Firm”, believing she has brought embarrassment to the Royal Family.His relationship with younger brother Andrew has been strained as a result. They do not get on personally, perhaps triggered by Fergie siding with Princess Diana over Camilla.In her  book, Fergie says of Diana: “She was two years younger than I, and I strove to support and protect her as I would a younger sister — as I still do today, as a best friend.”Prince Harry is supportive of his aunt, who still has the title Duchess of York, given his close relationship with cousins Beatrice and Eugenie.And Prince William is also on board with her renaissance, despite failing to invite Fergie to his  wedding to Kate Middleton.But the other major fear within the royal camp is Fergie’s desire to make money off her royal position.It was revealed last week that she was handed almost £, from a firm chaired by Hong Kong businessman Dr Johnny Hon, as well as a £,-a-year retainer for her non-executive directorship of his film- investment company.According to multi-millionaire Dr Hon, Fergie’s role was introducing him to key contacts.As far back as January , she signed a £million deal to become a WeightWatchers ambassador in the US, having already appeared in commercials for fruit juice brands and Olympus cameras.She has also released  books, including Dieting With The Duchess in , and even got cameos in hit comedies Friends and The Vicar Of Dibley, playing herself. Cash from these jobs went some way in helping Andrew to clear the huge debts she racked up.Andrew, meanwhile, continues to enjoy an enviable lestyle courtesy of a trust fund set up for him as a child.There is also an annual allowance from the Queen via The Sovereign Grant, which also pays for staff costs his Royal Navy pension plus substantial investments in businesses and property.ITV’s Royal Editor Chris Ship was the first to reveal Andrew and Fergie were “back together” in April.But his bombshell story was officially denied by Fergie.Later that month, The Sun confirmed that the couple were back together in a romantic relationship which pals branded “friends with benefits”.Fergie had married Andrew in July  at Westminster Abbey, sealing the union with a kiss on the balcony of Buckingham Palace in front of , people.The couple announced their separation in  after Fergie was pictured topless and having her toes sucked by her American financial adviser John Bryan on holiday in France.Their orce was finalised four years later, with the Palace announcing that the duchess would no longer carry out public engagements on behalf of the Queen.These days the Yorks live together at the Royal Lodge in Windsor, but brought up their daughters in their official residence, Sunninghill Park in Berkshire, until .Just four years ago, Fergie described herself and Andrew as “the happiest orced couple in the world”, saying: “Extraordinary, really, isn’t it. We live in the same house, but then, it’s a big house, so that’s OK. But I think it’s really good that we believe in compromise and communication and compassion. And family.”Fergie also says of Andrew: “He’s still my handsome prince, he’ll always be my handsome prince.”In this extraordinary royal romance, the possibility can’t be ruled out.FERGIE is no stranger to embarrassing situations.In  she was pictured topless and having her toes sucked by her US financial adviser John Bryan in St Tropez.She used her links with the royals to sign a £.million contract with WeightWatchers in .And six months before Princess Diana died, Fergie claimed to have got a wart from shoes she had borrowed from her.She scaled back plans for lavish th birthday celebrations in  due to a lack of cash.After being snubbed from William and Kate’s wedding in , Fergie claimed: “I really love the feeling that sort of Diana and I both weren’t there.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

worth  million or £ million - has a private runway for his plane, dubbed the Lolita Express.The disgraced financier, , used his plane to fly in his powerful pals – and young girls to entertain them, court documents claim.Epstein’s alleged ‘sex slave’ Virginia Giuffre claimed she was lent out to the sex beasts influential pals when she was just .In a trove of court papers, released hours before Epstein’s jail suicide, Virginia claimed Prince Andrew visited the New Mexico ranch.She claims his visit came after she had sex with the royal at the London home of Epstein’s alleged ‘madam’ Ghislaine Maxwell in .Andrew has always vehemently denied the claims - which were struck from the record in  by a US judge who deemed them immaterial.A Buckingham Palace spokesman previously said: “This relates to proceedings in the United States, to which the Duke of York is not a party.“Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.“It is emphatically denied that the Duke had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts .“Any claim to the contrary is  and without foundation.”During a stay at the ranch, Virginia claims Epstein offered to pay her to have a baby that he and his Brit socialite lover could bring up.Epstein allegedly offered the teen a mansion and a monthly allowance to go through with the sordid deal, according to court papers.Virginia, who is now , alleges she was warnedshe ever left Epstein she would have to sign over the baby to him and his then-girlfriend Ghislaine.The allegations were made in a lawsuit filed in Florida in  but emerged after Epstein, , was charged with underage sex trafficking charges.Giuffre told lawyers: “He came up with a proposition that I thought was disgustingly sick.He offered me a mansion and money every month, a monthly allowance,to bear one of his children.The proposition was thatanything ever happened between Jeffrey and I, that I would have to sign my child over to him basically and that the child would be his and Ghislaine and I would be looking after it as nothing happened between Jeffrey and I.”It’s been claimed that the paedo confided in scientists that he planned to impregnate dozens of women at his New Mexico ranch.He wanted up to  women to be pregnant with his children at a time - in a bizarre sci-fi-like plot to improve the human race with his genes, the New York Times said.Multiple sources told the paper that convicted paedophile Epstein would boast of his sick plans at champagne-fuelled parties.The shamed financier apparently began sharing his vision for his ,sq ft Zorro Ranch in the early s.He would allegedly tell scientists and businessmen he wanted the vast New Mexico property to be turned into his own personal baby-making factory.There, women would be inseminated with his sperm and give birth to his babies, two top scientists and a leading business adviser told the Times.It was not clearEpsteins stranger-than-fiction dream would involve him having sex with the women or them being articially inseminated.Epstein told of the plot at least twice - at his Manhattan mansion in  and a luxury science conference he hosted in the Virgin Islands, its alleged.But the business adviser claimed he heard others discussing Epsteins apparent warped idea, the paper added - suggesting it was no secret.Computer scientist and writer Jaron Lanier told the Times he heard about the plot from a NASA scientist at an Epstein gathering in New York.Lanier said the scientist told him that Epstein was inspired by the controversial sperm bank the Repository for Germinal Choice in Calornia.It was stocked by high-achieving white males – reportedly including as many as five Nobel Prize winners – from  to .He was arrested on July ,  for sex trafficking minors in Florida and New York.Epstein was arrested on July ,  on sex trafficking charges.Court documents allege that at least  underage girls were brought to Epstein’s mansion for sexual encounters.He was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey.FBI agents are also said to have broken down the door to his Manhattan townhouse.He pleaded not guilty to child sex trafficking charges in New York and could face  years in prisonfound guilty.On July , a federal judge said that the disgraced financier presented a danger to the community and must stay in one of New Yorks toughest prisons while he awaits a trial over the sex trafficking accusations.The shamed financier was locked up amid fears he would flee the country.Epstein was also reportedly fascinated with the unproven science of cryogenics.It involves people’s bodies or body parts being frozen at very low temperatures in the hope they can be brought back to le in the future.According to another source, Epstein described wanting to have his penis and head cryogenically preserved.Mr Balderas has been in contact with prosecutors in New York, where Epstein has already been charged and is awaiting trial.Epstein, , was first convicted of underage sex offences in  when he agreed to a so-called ‘sweetheart deal’ in Florida.He admitted a single charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution in exchange for a  month jail sentence, and registering as a sex offender.Shortly after completing his sentence he bought the New Mexico ranch from the family of the late New Mexico governor Bruce King.Under New Mexico law he was not required to register as a sex offender there.According to local reports Epstein did voluntarily contact the sherfs office in Santa Fe when he bought the ranch, alerting them about his conviction.But the New Mexico Department of Public Safety then told him he did not need to.New Mexico attorney general Hector Balderas said the fact Epstein had not been required to register as a sex offender in the region was a huge black eye for our state."},{"url":null,"title":"posturing revolutionary corbyn unfit to lead","story":"The Labour leader demanded that their “priority” should be to put him into No as a “strictly time- limited temporary” Prime Minister, to postpone Brexit and call an election.But Mr Corbyn’s “plan” unravelled as soon as it was unveiled, with new Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson ruling out — as she has many times before — any possibility of working with him.Whatever one thinks of the Lib Dems’ stance on Brexit, the party is genuinely mainstream, with mainstream MPs and a mainstream leader.So it should surprise no one that the Lib Dems are not willing to countenance putting a man many consider to be a racist, socialist revolutionary into power, even for a day and even to stop Brexit.But their rejection will not have surprised Mr Corbyn or his allies in any way because they knew full well that his letter would crash and burn the moment it was made public.Indeed, that is precisely why they sent it. Not for a moment did they envisage having to act on it.The letter was — like almost everything Mr Corbyn has ever said or done — about posturing rather than acting. The Labour leader spent  years as a backbencher before his elevation to being Leader of the Opposition.During those three decades he achieved precisely nothing.Had he not been elected leader, the few people to have been aware of his existence would have known him as a minor fringe MP who hung out with terrorists and racists.The sum total of his contribution to politics as a backbencher was to have proposed  Early Day Motions, the parliamentary equivalent of tweeting.Topics which he considered worth his time included “seal genitalia”, “Disney children’s pyjamas” and an MI proposal to use pigeons as flying bombs.Mr Corbyn’s natural disposition is to tear down, to criticise and to oppose.He could not even bring himself to support his own party when it was in power, voting against the last Labour government  times.There is not a single piece of legislation that owes anything to his contribution.This is the context in which his and Labour’s seemingly incoherent stance on Brexit — one day against another referendum, another day for one one day for Brexit, another day for Remain — must be seen.He is uninterested in the mechanics of a concrete solution. He has no real views on the details of Brexit or even how we get there.For Mr Corbyn, Brexit is a means to an end — which is as a vehicle to power.That is why, for example, he has on  occasions instructed Labour MPs either to abstain or to vote with the Government on Brexit, rather than attempting in any serious way to force the Government to change course, either over the type or Brexit on offer or a second referendum.He wants Brexit.He and his coterie of revolutionary socialists believe that leaving without a deal will be chaotic and that in that chaos Labour will be swept into office.But that, by definition, requires Brexit both to happen and to be chaotic.Most of his party take a dferent view — most are Remainers — so every so often the Corbynites view it as tactically wise to offer the appearance of wanting to work against the Government’s version of Brexit.Hence yesterday’s letter. But it is all meaningless posing. In her speech yesterday rejecting Mr Corbyn’s demand that she support him as PM, Jo Swinson hit the nail on the head.She said: “In my first week as leader of the Liberal Democrats I called on Jeremy Corbyn to table a vote of no confidence in the Government and I asked him to table it before summer recess, because that was the only way to be sure we could hold an election before crashing out on the st of October.”You do not have to share Ms Swinson’s opposition to Brexit to accept that her analysis is spot on.Mr Corbyn refused to table such a vote of no confidence at the end of July. Had he actually wanted to avoid No Deal, he would have done.There was every chance Boris Johnson’s new government would have lost and we would now be in the middle of an election campaign.Whatever the outcome of that election, we would not — as we are now — be spending time analysing the prospects of a so-called government of national unity or looking at cynical letters written by the Labour leader.Mr Corbyn and his allies doubtless think they are being extremely clever, riding two horses at the same time.But his problem is that every time he opens his mouth, the unsuitability for office becomes ever clearer. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A judge found the couple benefited from crime to the tune of around £,. They spent that sum in around five years, police said. Prosecutors will now try to claw back some of the cash through a Proceeds of Crime investigation. Henry Blackshaw, prosecuting, said the Clayton couple were ‘living well on the back of criminality’. He said the pair spent ‘extravagantly’, holidaying in Cancun, Gran Canaria, Bulgaria and buying BMWs, Audis and Mercedes cars. Coleen worked part-time at Matalan and received working tax credits.  Thomas, unemployed since , abruptly declared himself a self-employed fitness instructor when he became aware he was of interest to the authorities. But it was too late. Police had already linked him to a network of dealers. The pair paid for a -day holiday to Cancun with £, in cash. They travelled to the Mexican city with their children in ‘premium seats’ and stayed at the five-star Hard Rock Hotel. Their accommodation included a jacuzzi, -hour room service and an Xbox. During the holiday, they also chartered a motorboat.    The pair enjoyed holidays to Sharm el-Sheikh and a resort in Bulgaria. High-powered cars with personalised number plates were also acquired. Thomas bought a black . litre Mercedes AMG for £, on a finance agreement. His we bought a black BMW X, which also had a personalised number plate, and cost £,. Those two cars were seized when the pair were arrested. Prosecutors said the pair frequently ‘traded up’ their vehicles to more expensive cars before the end of the finance agreement.  A further £, was spent building a two-storey side extension at the coupleaposs home, the court heard. Prosecutors said the ‘dirty money’ came from family connections and close associates, but the court did not hear specic evidence on the sources of the cash. A trial of issue was held at Manchester Crown Court this week, in which the judge ruled the pair benefited from crime to the tune of around £,. Passing sentence, Judge Martin Rudland locked up Thomas for two years, while Coleen was spared jail. She received a  month sentence, suspended for two years. Detective Sergeant Dominic Campbell from Greater Manchester Police’s Serious Crime and Public Protection Division said: We know how demoralising it is for the hard-working, law-abiding members of the public to see criminals in our communities showing off their ill-gotten gains that have been funded as a result of crime.

Samantha Ford was sentenced for killing her -month-old toddlers Jake and Chloe at her home on Boxing Day last year, just weeks after she and her husband Steven, , split. The -year-old admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility but denied murdering the toddlers - and the prosecution accepted her guilty plea after an assessment of her mental health. She was jailed for  years at the Old Bailey. Fordaposs lawyer claims she was suffering from acute depression at the time, but prosecution psychiatrists believe she may have been exaggerating her illness, with one claiming she killed the twins in a fit of narcissistic rage.    Distressing details about the childrenaposs deaths and Fordaposs mental state emerged during the sentencing hearing as people struggle to make sense of the family tragedy. The sentencing hearing began in July and continued on Friday with further psychiatric evidence at the Old Bailey in London. How did the twins die  Ford drowned Jake and Chloe in the bath at her rented home in Westwood, Kent, near Margate, on Boxing Day. Afterwards, she got into her Ford Galaxy and crashed into the back of a lorry at mph on the London-bound carriageway of the A Thanet Way, near Whitstable, just before am on December . Ford wasnapost wearing a seatbelt when she attempted to take her own le. After rescuers arrived at the scene, she told police: Iaposve killed my babies. Please let me die.  I put them in the bath. We were meant to be together. She added: I would never hurt them, they are my miracle babies. She also said: This is all a dream. I should have gone to the hospital sooner. Heaposs messing with my head. Police found the toddlers just after .am at Samanthaaposs home on a new-build estate about  miles from the crash scene. What led up to the deaths  The Fords had spent their first  years of marriage living in Qatar, where Mr Ford was a club captain at the Doha Golf Club. Samantha became pregnant with twins after four rounds of IVF treatment, giving birth to Jake and Chloe in . In early , the family moved back to the UK to a house in Charing, near Ashford in Kent. But emotionally controlling and materialistic Samantha was angry at leaving their lavish lestyle in Qatar and wanted toto the Middle East, the Old Bailey heard.    The Fordsapos marriage deteriorated and they split in November last year, with Samantha and the twins moving into a rented house near Margate. In the weeks leading up to the deaths, Fordaposs health had rapidly deteriorated and she had Googled methods of suicide and murder. Prosecutor Tom Kark QC told a July hearing that Samantha had sent multiple text messages to Mr Ford, including one which read: You have ripped my world apart. He added: She was very upset that the relationship had broken down and didnapost like the idea of becoming a single mother. One message to Steven said: Why do you choose a job in London over living in an amazing country with our children. Now our children are going to live a miserable le. Now we are destined to live a miserable le in a sh*thole.  Samantha killed the children shortly after her estranged husband dropped them off at her home. Before the tragedy, social media posts made it seem like the Fords were a happy and active family. One photo showed the couple smiling, each with a twin strapped to them in a baby carrier. Other snaps showed them on family days out. What was Samanthaaposs mental state  At the July hearing, Brenda Campbell QC, defending Ford, said her client had been suffering from depression as a result of the breakdown of her marriage but was a devoted and loving mother to the twins. Ms Campbell said: Mrs Ford has been entirely devastated by her own actions and is cognisant she has devastated many others in the process. What happened to Jake and Chloe happened in the middle of a marital breakdown which was dficult. She suffered a catastrophic level of depression leading her to believe that she and the children needed to die.    Ms Campbell said there had been  communications between Ford and mental health services in the weeks before the killings. The court heard Ford had sent a message on Christmas Day, telling someone: I just need to end. I just need something to strike him to make him know what heaposs doing. But experts for the prosecution believe she may have been exaggerating her illness. Prosecution expert Dr Muzzaffar Hussain, a consultant forensic psychiatrist who has treated Ford, said her actions could be attributed to a narcissistic rage at her perceived humiliation at the hands of her husband. Dr Hussain said Ford had shown a sense of entitlement and attributed bad things that happen to others. She was experiencing a homicide suicide fantasy which was in play as a way of retaliation and of punishment of Mr Ford for leaving her - a sense of aposthis is what you made me doapos, he said. In hospital, Ford claimed she had heard voices telling her to kill the children - claims she had not made before she was hospitalised, the court heard.  Dr Hussain said: Unfortunately I think itaposs a wish to appear more severely ill than she is. I donapost deny that she is ill but I think thereaposs a wish to come across more severely unwell than she is and thereaposs a part of that thataposs coloured the narrative a little bit. After the crash, Ford was in hospital with minor injuries and was initially charged with two counts of murder. She denied the charges. The mum avoided a murder trial after the prosecution accepted her plea to the lesser charge following a psychiatric report. At Fridayaposs hearing, consultant psychiatrist Philip Joseph said Fordaposs poor mental health was a signicant contributory factor in the killings but it wasnapost the cause. He said: Taking everything into account Iaposve come to the conclusion that the illness was moderate severity. The abnormality of mental ing is a depressive illness of at least moderate severity.  She was quite fixated about Steven Ford while in hospital, wanting to know he was suffering as well. I think more important and influencing my opinion is hisimpact statement itself. I think that has to be taken into account, his perception of why she did this is important. Unless the courts decide he was being vindictive in that statement - an impression I did not get. What has the twinsapos dad said  At the hearing in July, prosecutor Ed Brown QC read a victim impact statement from grief-stricken Mr Ford, who said: I believe what happened here is an extreme version of her character. Like a tantrum. She knew it was the ultimate punishment. The total shock and pain is indescribable. In that moment my le had changed in a heartbeat. My two beautul babies were healthy, bright and loving children who had everything to le for. Being twins they were a real double act.

The billionaire financier named the huge estate in New Mexico, developed in the early s, the Zorro Ranch after the masked hero of his childhood. But the man unmasked as a depraved paedophile destroyed countless other childhoods there by using the site as a nightmarish sex lair with accomplices. Investigators fear dozens of girls were flown in on Epstein’s private jet, nicknamed the Lolita Express, to be abused. And following his death in custody last week, aged , the ranch will be the focus of an FBI probe on his vile network. Among those facing scrutiny is British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who allegedly helped Epstein traffic a -year-old to Zorro Ranch and joined him in abusing her there.    Maxwell was a regular visitor, flying to the estate  times in three years. The -year-old – who has denied all claims and never been arrested – was pictured for the first time in three years on Monday as she visited a Calornia burger bar. And we can today reveal prosecutors want to speak to a second Brit who frequented the desert bolthole. The fiend’s alleged victims have named Emmy Tayler, , who is said to have worked as an assistant to Maxwell in the early noughties. Flight logs show she was a Zorro regular. Tayler also accompanied “sex slave” Virginia Giuffre, then known as Virginia Roberts, to London before the -year-old was pictured with Epstein’s former pal Prince Andrew.    In a court filing in Florida from , Giuffre named the ranch as one of the places where she was sexually abused by Epstein and forced to have sex with other men. The Duke of York has ­vehemently denied her claim that she was “lent out” to him three times. Another alleged victim claimed in court that Epstein flew her younger sister to Zorro in , telling their mother he would help the -year-old with her education. In an affidavit, she claims Epstein and Maxwell molested her sister, stating: “It was not until later in the summer when I called my sister in Thailand, where she was studying, that I learned what had happened to her at Epstein’s New Mexico ranch.”  The woman, now , alleged that she too was abused by Epstein and Maxwell, and reported her assault to New York police and FBI – but they took no action. She wrote: “To my knowledge, I was the first person to report Maxwell and Epstein to the FBI. It took a signicant amount of bravery because I knew how powerful and influential both were.” While scouring the south-western state of New Mexico for a house to add to his portfolio, Epstein told estate agents that “privacy, privacy, privacy” was paramount. Pat French was approached and she said: “He wanted something really far away from people.” She recalled visiting the luxury Four Seasons hotel with her teenage daughter once to drop off brochures. Pat said of arriving at Epstein’s suite: “There were all these girls. A little bit older than my daughter. Not much. I thought, ‘Oh, these must be his daughters and friends he took along on the trip.’ I had no idea about this man.”    Pat had no further dealings with Epstein, who went through another agent to pay £million for a ,-acre ranch in Stanley in . Naming it Zorro, he built a ,sqft hilltop mansion. Then, in , he sought approval to build a “grass strip runway for a private plane” on state land within his lease. But when officials wanted to send inspectors to approve his plans, Epstein withdrew the request and built a runway on land he owned outright. Surrounded by private land – including , acres bought in  by fashion designer Tom Ford, whose name is in Epstein’s “little black book” – the estate gave the billionaire and his accomplices the perfect hideaway.  It was also at Zorro that the deviant hatched his crackpot plans to cryogenically freeze his penis and seed the human race with his DNA. When we visited yesterday, staff refused to answer the intercom or allow access to the ranch. Countless CCTV cameras ­monitored our movements. Ms Giuffre and the -year-old were among victims who helped get Epstein convicted of child sex offences in Florida in . But after a sweetheart plea deal he served only  months of an -month sentence and signed the sex offenders’ register where he had homes. The New Mexico Department of Public Safety told him in  he must register with the Santa Fe County Sherf’s Office. Epstein did so and notied authorities whenever he was going to New Mexico. Then detective Deborah Anaya, with the Santa Fe County Sherf’s Office, made an unannounced visit to Zorro that August to interview Epstein as part of the department’s determination of his sex offender status.

Red Square was packed. The crowd stared at a huge screen. As on every New Year’s Eve, they were straining to hear the annual presidential message. Boris Yeltsin, his speech slurred either due to his heart condition or alcohol, rarely disappointed. But as the new millennium dawned, he did just that. Instead of Yeltsin, an awkward bureaucrat filled the screen. He wore the kind of ill-fitting suit that was a hallmark of the Russian secret police, the KGB. The man explained that President Yeltsin had asked him to take over his duties. The speech continued in such a wooden manner, it could have been an episode of Thunderbirds. In his late s, the civil servant tried to reassure his audience. He promised that as acting President, he would uphold the rule of law, freedom of speech and the right to private property.  This man, Vladimir Putin, had been appointed Prime Minister the previous August,  years ago this week. After studying law in his native Leningrad , Putin joined the KGB and for five years in the s was stationed in Dresden where he lived with his we, Lyudmila and his two daughters. The marriage lasted  years before Putin confirmed their orce in . But in  few Russians recognised him or even knew who he was. Boris Berezovsky and his small band of super-wealthy oligarchs had steered Putin’s passage through the Kremlin corridors. They were all convinced that once Putin assumed the presidency, he would do their bidding, just as Yeltsin had. Two decades on, most of those oligarchs are dead or in exile fearing for their lives. And the President himself  In terms of both longevity in office and influence, he is on a par with Russia’s three overwhelming leaders: Peter the Great, ­Catherine the Great and Joseph Stalin. He is virtually unchallenged within Russia and outside he strolls around the global stage like a Marvel comic hero.  The original political Iron Man, he fashioned a system dubbed by one of his admirers as an “illiberal democracy”. His tough-guy image has spawned wannabes as far apart as Brazil and Turkey.Just over a year ago he held a summit in Helsinki with President Trump. The body language spoke volumes. In the US, the thin-skinned Mr Trump unleashes intemperate Twitter attacks against anyone who has offended him.But with Putin, Trump was fawning. He readily accepted Putin’s assurances that Russia had not interfered in the US elections of  despite the clear insistence of the FBI, the CIA and Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, that there was massive interference. A narcissist such as Trump is putty in the hands of an ­experienced KGB officer like Putin, whose achievements are remarkable given that Russia has an economy which is  times smaller than that of the United States. It’s only half the size of Brexit-battered Britain and yet Putin is now one of the most powerful and, many believe, richest men on the planet. Although he stands at just ft in, exactly the same height as Napoleon, in Russia Putin has carefully cultivated the image of the tough guy: releasing photos of him fishing with no shirt on, riding motorbikes and hunting bears. Early on in the presidency, Putin found himself in a battle with the oligarchs, notably Boris Berezovsky. Until then the super-rich had controlled presidents. Putin flipped that around, using all the tricks in the KGB playbook: arrest,  corruption charges, murder and bribery.  When Berezovsky continued to organise political resistance to Putin from his refuge in Britain, the Russian secret service went into overdrive. Up to  Russian and British associates of Berezovsky have since died, including the oligarch himself, in the murkiest of circumstances. After asserting domestic authority, Putin focused on foreign policy. In , he used the constitutional crisis in neighbouring Ukraine to move troops into Crimea in clear violation of international law. This was followed by the occupation of large tracts of eastern Ukraine by volunteers and mercenaries. Seizing parts of Ukraine proved popular among ordinary Russians. But provoked a reaction in the West. The EU and the US imposed sanctions on Russia, hampering investment in the country’s main sources of revenue: gas and oil. Given the structural weakness of the Russian economy, Putin realised he had limited options to fight the sanctions. So, Russia expanded its covert activities designed to unsettle the West. Centred around a cyber criminal community and a successful Moscow troll farm, Russia began a co-ordinated programme of spreading fake news in advance of the Brexit referendum, the  US presidential election and polls in Germany, France and Italy.Putin has extended the hand of friendship to Turkey, Israel and EU member, Hungary. This has contributed to political chaos in the West which is now less able to formulate coherent policies to counter Russian influence from Venezuela to Eastern Europe and the Middle East.It has been Putin’s masterstroke. In terms of political tactics, Trump and new PM Boris Johnson are minnows in comparison. But in the long term Despite projecting the strong-man image, Putin now faces an array of domestic problems. In Moscow and other cities, people are taking to the streets, furious at the corrupt networks which suck in the country’s riches. Damaging fires sweep across Siberia, exposing the weakness of the Russian government’s response. Just last week, a mysterious nuclear explosion occurred in the north of Russia. Some have compared it to the  nuclear disaster at Chernobyl.

The -year-old British schoolgirlaposs family claimed she had been abducted, but police insisted she had climbed out of a window at their holiday cottage, wandered off and got lost in the tropical rainforest. The London schoolgirl, who had special needs, starved and died from intestinal rupture, Malaysian police said as post-mortem results were made public. The post-mortem exam found that she died from intestinal bleeding two to three days before her body was found about . miles from where she was last seen. Distraught parents, Meabh, , and Sebastien, , are reportedly waiting for the results of DNA and toxicology tests. But her family believe there are startling, unanswered questions about the police investigation and Noraaposs death. Here, we examine the mysteries in the case that her family say still arenapost solved.    Why did Nora leave the resort alone  Detectives believe Nora left through the accommodationaposs ground-floor aluminium framed window, before her father raised the alarm at am the following day. Family lawyer Charles Morel said Nora’s disability made it highly unlikely that she left the lodge at night and walked to the bottom of a ravine via an extremely steep path through the jungle by herself. The teenager had a smaller than average brain and struggled to act independently, having been born with Patau’s syndrome, or holoprosencephaly. The condition left her struggling to complete everyday tasks and with limited speech, walking ability and co-ordination. Mr Morel, based in Paris, said: One of the effects of her condition is that she was very dependent on her parents. She was shy, she was quickly scared, she had travelled for  hours and she was exhausted. So there is no reason why she would leave the lodge in the night, almost naked. There is no previous episode in her le to suggest she might do something like this.    Why was Noraaposs body not spotted earlier  Noraaposs unclothed body was discovered on Tuesday some . miles away from the resort where she had been staying. Witnesses said she was in plain sight and looked like she was sleeping with her head resting on her hands. Itaposs believed she had died between two and four days earlier, a post-mortem examination revealed. This has since raised questions around whether,this is the case, she would have been found sooner given she was not moving through the jungle during a large part of the -day search. The ravine where she was found was also repeatedly searched by rescue teams during the first seven days of her disappearance. Police have been unable to adequately explain why she was missed.  Was foul play involved  Noraaposs Grandfather Sylvain Quoirin said the family do not want the media to interpret the first result of the autopsy and exclude the idea of any criminal involvement. He said: Itaposs too early to say that. Even the place where she was found, two kilometres from the resort, itaposs very strange that she could go there by herself alone, so we cannot exclude the criminal hypothesis. He added that there are dark areas that need to be cleared up for the family to be able to grieve in peace. Nora’s uncle Pacome Quoirin, a graphic designer, added: How could she have survived for five days in the jungle without food or water,you believe the theory that she left the hotel on her own  We remain very dubious. Questions have also been raised around the fact Nora was find naked, despite going missing in her underwear.

the sides prepare for cup tie","story":"Dundee host Aberdeen in the Betfred Cup on Sunday and, eventhe Dons have had a few early season problems, it’s fair to say anything other than a win for them would be a shock.On the back of relegation, James McPake’s Dark Blues are finding their feet after a major overhaul of the squad during the summer.It means they go into this tie as major underdogs, though history does tell us this is a competition in which Dundee are capable of upsetting the odds.Tonight Tele Sport looks back at a couple of occasions when they have – and some others when the result has been true to the form book.While unlike the present format, this tie was over two legs, it was similar to this clash in that Dundee had just been relegated at the end of the previous season.Aberdeen were at the peak of their powers under Alex Ferguson and, as reigning champions, a bigger knockout tie for them was a European Cup meeting with Liverpool around the same time.That they went out of that competition to the team that would eventually win it was no great surprise but losing to Dundee was.After a draw at Dens in the first leg, the feeling was Donald Mackay’s team were heading to the Granite City hoping for little more than to keep the score respectable.In the end, however, a battling performance saw them hold their own and progress to the semi-finals thanks to a Cammy Fraser strike.Dundee would go on to make the final before losing to city rivals United on a historic day at Dens Park.The only time the north-east rivals have faced up in a national final and it was Aberdeen who lted the trophy with a comfortable Hampden victory.Once again, the pair met with Dundee, under Jim Duffy, out of the top flight but going into the tie on the back of a fine unbeaten run that saw them riding high in the First Division and making the final.For those of a Dark Blue persuasion, however, it quickly became a day to forget as their team didn’t really show up.An effort from former Dens favourite Billy Dodds had Aberdeen ahead by the break and, when Duncan Shearer added a second right at the start of the second half, it was all over bar the shouting.Although Dundee were again in the second tier, with the backing of Aberdeen-based businessman Callum Melville, their strong line-up was always going to provide a stern test for the visiting Dons.So it proved as, despite losing experienced goalkeeper Rab Douglas through injury in the first half, Jocky Scott’s team pulled off the result of the round by winning in extra-time.Goals from Eddie Malone and Craig Forsyth had the home team apparently cruising but a double from Michael Paton saw the proceedings heading into extra-time.As the game ebbed and flowed, one of those Melville-backed signings, a young Leigh Grfiths, came up trumps with the winner.The last time the teams met in a League Cup tie saw Dundee still recovering from a second period of administration that had seen the team almost fold the

Dundee will continue unimpeded despite the intention to sell Bell Street Music Centre, council bosses have vowed.Dundee City Council is set to list the four-floor music centre – which boasts a first-floor performance hall – for sale in the coming days.The centre has been the city’s home of public music tuition for decades, with records showing its use as far back as the s.As recently as June the venue has been used for community concerts, such as that staged by the Help For Kids choir supported by the Eveningand Overgate.However, the local authority has drawn up plans to sell the local facility, along with a number of other public buildings, in a bid to cut down on maintenance costs.An advance notice touts the building as a “development opportunity” with a price tag of £,.“The main building was originally designed as a church and has more recently been used as a music centre with the outstanding feature being the large performance hall at first floor level,” it reads.A spokeswoman for Dundee City Council said: “The provision of music tuition will be unaffected by the sale of Bell Street Music Centre.“Music tuition will continue at alternate sites throughout the city.”The spokeswoman declined to elaborate on where these may be.However, it is likely the council will look to harness the facilities in its newer school buildings under its  Schools initiative.The Bell Street plan is part of the council’s “property rationalisation” scheme, drawn up to reduce its real estate footprint.Among the other buildings set for redundancy are Claverhouse Social Work Office, Dudhope Castle and a former Technology Park lab.The costs of keeping surplus properties has contributed to a £. million overspend in the council’s city development budget.Earlier this week the Tele reported the council had sold and leased back its own HQ to a Canadian firm to balance its books.Finance boss Greg Colgan’s latest financial assessment concludes: “Property rationalisation . . . will lead to properties being vacated thus generating revenue savings . . . and the possibility of a capital receipt from a sale of the asset.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have

his side “weren’t good enough” from the start after they crumbled out of Europa League qualying.The Dons’ - loss last night matched the result in Croatia last week to send Rijeka through with a - aggregate win.A quick break saw Stjepan Loncar open the scoring for the visitors – after Scott McKenna and Sam Cosgrove calamitously collided at the other end – before £, signing Funso Ojo was dismissed for a second yellow card in  minutes.With Antonio Colak also netting before half-time, the second half was a total formality.However, McInnes, who has watched his team fall at the third qualying round five times in six attempts, thinks Austrian referee Harald Lechner’s decision to send off midfielder Ojo smacked of double standards.He said: “Up until the sending off we weren’t good enough. We were excitable with the ball, needed to settle down.“We just made some really poor decisions, even from the first minute.“The first goal comes from our corner kick, a poor delivery and then the second phase, we let ourselves be hit on the counter. Losing that first goal was like a balloon popping because the fans had turned up and played their part.“We needed to be better in possession in that first period.“Rijeka are more than decent. It’s disrespectful to think they’re an average team. They’re more than capable of taking advantage of our poor decision making.“After the sending off, it’s unfair on my players to be criticised. The game was effectively done.“It was an awful decision, to deem that two yellow card offences. I’ve never seen the like.“There were other challenges that he didn’t deem yellow cards, which surprised me, given what he did to Funso. There were Rijeka players with four or five fouls who didn’t get booked.“It’s poor decision making from us – and an awful decision from the referee has made it a very disappointing night.”The boss added: “I don’t think Funso is naïve. He’s been caught on the ball and put a challenge in.“The second one is maybe more of a yellow card than the first one, but I still shake my head at it. The referee hammered the final nail in the coffin by sending him off.“I’m not blaming the referee, I need to stress that – but Christ he had a big part to play in that tonight. We needed to be far better, so there are very few positives I can take from the European experience.“We need to dust ourselves down, we’re out of Europe and need to focus on domestic matters. There will be loads of doom and gloom, loads of people doubting my team.”McInnes had surprised everybody with the inclusion from the start of eight-goal striker Sam Cosgrove, who he’d said was out with a hamstring injury.However, as Dons temperatures increased, the Englishman – who’d been booked in the first half – looked more likely to join Ojo in the dressing room than scoring and was eventually hooked for Curtis Main.Once it was at the stage where Aberdeen were a man down and then in need of five unanswered goals to get through to the play-offs, McInnes admitted he started thinking about Sunday’s Betfred Cup clash against Dundee at Dens Park.Aberdeen will go there trying to stop the rot of three straight defeats, after a league loss at St Mirren on Sunday punctuated the Rijeka defeats.McInnes said: “You don’t find yourself in that situation very often, a goal down and down to ten men so early, when your fans have turned up ready for a big yeeha and get in about it.“From then I’m thinking about the Dundee game, thinking about getting men off.”On Cosgrove, McInnes said: “He was fit. I wasn’t totally honest because we hadn’t ruled him out totally. I wanted them to not know he would be in until they saw the teamsheet.“We wanted to seeSam reacted today. He was keen to give it a go. He was fit, but we got him off after -odd minutes so we didn’t put it more at risk.“If there is no more reaction, he should be fit for Sunday’s game.“It’s a game that has become really important for us to show a response.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44697836-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44697836-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44697836-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44697836-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"reds crushed by croatians","story":"This Europa League tie left you with a distinct feeling of ‘what  ’Ten-man Aberdeen were eliminated - on aggregate after a - defeat to Rijeka in the second leg at Pittodrie last night.It’s the fth time in six seasons the Dons have fallen at the third qualying round stage.Although both teams have changed a great deal from four years ago, that the Reds had emphatically beaten Rijeka - on aggregate a round earlier in  made this feel like a winnable tie.There is not the daylight between the sides that the aggregate score suggests, but over both legs Rijeka were superior in the key moments and ruthlessly punished Aberdeen’s mistakes.In the first leg Shay Logan’s needless penalty concession was gratefully received by Antonio Colak and a quality finish from Robert Muric late on in Croatia gave Rijeka the upper hand.It was never going to be easy for Derek McInnes’ men to overturn the deficit – the Reds have only managed it once before in Europe and that was in March  against Ujpest of Hungary when Sir Alex Ferguson’s team were defending the European Cup Winners’ Cup.But two moments in the first half decided this tie and extinguished hopes of a famous comeback.A clinical counter-attack finished off by Stjepan Loncar on  minutes and Funso Ojo’s over-enthusiasm getting the better of him resulting in his sending off for two yellow cards  minutes later.McInnes made four changes from Sunday’s - defeat to St Mirren. Sam Cosgrove, Niall McGinn, Jon Gallagher and Logan ed with Curtis Main, Scott Wright, Connor McLennan and Zak Vyner on the bench.An early goal was what the Red Army were hoping for – but it arrived at the wrong end on  minutes.The Croatians broke quickly from a Dons corner with Maxwell Acosty burrowing down the right, he laid the ball back for Ivan Lepinjica and the midfielder’s teasing cross was flicked beyond Joe Lewis by LONCAR, who ghosted in at the front post.When it mattered it was another moment of quality incisive attacking play – a fine cross and deft finish to match.After that Rijeka were content to sit deep in defence and attempt to break at speed on the counter-attack.Things got worse for the Dons in the th minute as they were reduced to  men.Ojo had been booked for a foul on Acosty after only six minutes and then a poor touch meant he tripped Luka Capan with Austrian referee Harald Lechner quick to show the second yellow card and then a red.From the moment Ojo walked up the tunnel any hope of salvaging the tie was gone.In the nd minute Rijeka doubled their lead from another breakaway from a McGinn free-kick.Again it was Acosty down the right – this time finding captain Zoran Kvrzic – the skipper’s deep delivery picked out COLAK at the back post and he nodded down and in from close range.Aberdeen’s only effort on target in the  minutes was just before the break with keeper Andrej Prskalo parrying Ryan Hedges’ -yard drive.The second half was distinctly non-descript. Aberdeen worked hard in a -- formation to avoid further damage and Rijeka were content to knock the ball around defence and midfield without really threatening to score a third.The supporters started to filter out of Pittodrie before the full-time whistle as another European campaign came to a disappointing end.The Dons will need to regroup quickly after this disappointment as they face Dundee at Dens Park on Sunday in an important League Cup last- tie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 14 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsBike scrambling fans out there of a certain age will be feeling nostalgic at the prospect of ato a track described as #one of the best in the world# later this month.Kilmartin is famous in the motocross world and mouths are watering at the prospect.Not that long ago,you had walked into a shop and asked for a bottle of water you would be offered fizzy French stuff or perhaps tonic or soda water.Plain drinking water  We had taps for that.A multi-million pound industry has #sprung# up, selling water to us in plastic bottles.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"cuddles with carla the champion","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe overall open dog champion at last weekend#s unexpectedly sun-drenched Mid Argyll Show was Carla, a -year-old Rottweiler owned by Julie Grove from Scammadale near Oban.Carla was four years old when she was adopted from a Glasgow dog rescue centre by Julie.

Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace.

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily promote it.ldquoNo one is disputing that the two wind farms would be separate, wersquore working to find out what degree of separation would be appropriate.Mr Welsh responded: ldquoIf you increase to a km distance it will push all m turbines outwith the area that has been identied as having the appropriate topography for this type of development.Ms Cook also sought clarication on certain technical points, mostly surrounding tables and figures contained within ious reports submitted by the appellant and the local authority."},{"url":null,"title":"art-thou-shakespeare-cyclists","story":"BORDERS

They have got the choice of three roads. The first is the C, which is impossible. Somebody would get killed every day.ldquoThe second is the Lowood Bridge and that is unsuitable.ldquoIf anybody is on that bridge, how will a -tonne lorry be able to pass  If it tried to squeeze through, it would hit the people and would crush them.ldquoThe other option is bringing the traffic through the town and the community of Galashiels does not want that.ldquoThe roads were not built for that use. It is dangerous.ldquoThere never has been a route proposed on this application and there is still not one to this day.ldquoSo how could it have been approved, without knowing where the traffic is going Melrose community councillor Mr Douglas claimed SBC was ldquounnecessarily endangering the publicrsquos lives and putting financial expedience before public safety in a letter to council chief executive Tracey Logan.And he asked to see a copy of a lsquopre-planning application decisionrsquo on potential vehicle routes.But, in a response, Ms Logan said: ldquoI have been advised no such document exists.She added the council had considered a transport statement and a report from the public consultation process.However, she admitted: ldquoNo detail of vehicle routes was included within either document. This was principally because at the time of the planning application, the contract for removing and treating wasted had not yet been awarded, meaning that the end destination was not known.ldquoThe council has recently awarded the contract for waste recycling to Levenseat, a company based near Forth in North Lanarkshire. Levenseat will consider dferent routes at dferent times of the day, depending on circumstances such as traffic....

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many more could get this help – whether through financial charities or commercial organisations.Richard Gardiner,"},{"url":null,"title":"letter thanks","story":"I#m pleased to report the day raised £ for

summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter trying to keep everyone happy","story":"We, as the private landowners, have endeavoured throughout the years to make this historical area  as fully accessible to the general public as possible.Our use of introducing a few sheep to graze down the grass over certain months of the year is our preferred method but often, when summer visitors appear, we find the animals get frequently disturbed and distressed with human contact , and very often remove them in busy months to avoid any upset.The larger access gate is frequently left wide open, leading to constant rounding up of the livestock and  posing a danger to the passing road users, with even the odd complaint about our animals ‘deposits’  around the Footprints area coming into the equation too.Changing climate conditions have ensured that bracken and other plant species have increased in volume as every year passes and with worry about the decreasing insect population and visiting dogs perhaps being harmed by ingesting sprayed grass, we have never used any chemical solutions to help keep the undergrowth at bay.Strimming has been used on occasions  but this, too, has produced complaints from the public about the unnecessary removal of wild flowers and plants that provide food for the visiting bird and butterfly population.Sign posts are often needlessly torn down and often used to fuel beach fires and barbecues, with even the old, fragile, stone dyke surrounding the area being constantly clambered over,  rather than using the access gate, causing stones to be dislodged and even the wall being  deliberately dismantled, in order to use the stones to construct fire pits for outdoor cooking.In short, we’ve found there are never any easy answers when it comes to trying to keep everyone happy.Yours,Catherine Barbour,"},{"url":null,"title":"top artist jolomo finds inspiration on his doorstep","story":"The latest exhibition by John Lowrie Morrison, which opens on Saturdayat the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead, concentrates on paintings of Crinan and Knapdale, landscapes found within a few miles of his Tayvallich home.Although John’s work is now sought out by collectors all over the world, he continues to exhibit every August at his #local# gallery # this will be his th solo exhibition at the Archway.

It is an intimate world, personal and subjective, the world of our thoughts and feelings. Children live in it quite naturally, but as adults we tend to withdraw from it.#I use high-key expressionist colour to express how I feel about the landscape.#I’ve been painting the area around me now for over  years, and the more I paint Knapdale, the more intensely I use light and colour to express my emotions for the landscape.#John worked for  years as an art teacher at Lochgilphead High School, then in art education with Strathclyde Region before leaving work to paint full-time in .His distinctive colourful landscapes quickly made him one of the Scotland’s most successful painters, with celebrities such as Sting, Madonna, Simon Le Bon and Gregor Fisher collecting his work.Wilma Meikle, who owns the Archway Gallery with her husband Iain, said: #We’re delighted that John has supported the gallery for all these years.

This is standard, legal practice. Safety is our number one priority when arranging home to school transport.The spokesperson added: ldquoWe are working with colleagues across the council and in schools to ensure that all pupils who have been issued with a bus pass are on the transport providersrsquo lists and to improve access to the school transport timetables.ldquoWe recognise that this may have caused uncertainty for parents, carers and pupils.ldquoOur staff and the transport providers will continue to work closely together to manage the transition to these new arrangements.Councillor Craig Hoy, ward member, said: ldquoI was relieved to get clear reassurance from council staff on the issues of vehicle safety and the safety of children travelling from Gford and outlying areas to Knox Academy.ldquoItrsquos clear that there were communications problems which impacted parents and pupils.

While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The ,-capacity venue, one of the best-known in Britain, with a giant neon sign that has become a landmark, has played host to everyone from Bob Dylan to REM, U, David Bowie and Oasis. Next to it lies the Barras, the famed open-air weekend market. All around are pubs, shops and restaurants. An adult shop sits just opposite.This is a street that stirs all sorts of opinions, some of them fairer than others. \"A walk up the Gallowgate ndash takeaways, pawnshops and Celtic pubs ahoy ndash can feel a bit dicey on occasion, but its all part of the Barrowlands experience,\" an English newspaper noted a few years ago. \"A dingy red-light area of Glasgow,\" one architecture magazine said disapprovingly, back in .An encyclopedia of Scotland notes that Gallowgate retained \"much of its distinctive earthy charm\" despite wholesale demolition and regeneration. \"This part of town is gritty, and a far cry from the historical tenement buildings of the centre, but it gives you a taste of the citys authentic character,\" observed the Dubai-based Business Traveller Middle East in .Relive the Roaring Twenties - The Ivy, Glasgow: restaurant review by Ron MackennaGoing back even further, the Edinburgh-born novelist Naomi Mitchison, in her notes for a post-war novel, wrote impatiently of the Gallowgate: \"Notice how many children you see with obvious rickets, impetigo or heads close clipped for lice see the wild, slippered, sluts, not caring anymore to look decent!\"You get the picture.But things are changing. The area is increasingly home to creative businesses and a new generation of pubs and restaurants. The Creative East End organisation is one such based at  Gallowgate, and led by Lauren Stewart and Jen McGlone, it provides space for initiatives and ideas to flourish in the interests of economic growth and regeneration. Over at Calton Entry, the thriving BAaD - Barras Art and Design - includes a fish restaurant, AChalltainn, as well as concerts and a Sunday indoor market.Just next to the Barrowland lies what was once a well-known Celtic pub. Bairds Bar, it was called: here,  years ago, the then interim Celtic manager Kenny Dalglish held one of the more unusual press conferences in the clubs history. Bairds was shut down amid ious well-publicised dficulties in , but recently it was reopened as a restaurant,  Gallowgate, which has been praised by none other than the Herald on Sundays exacting restaurant critic, Joanna Blythman. \"The people who opened  Gallowgate,\" read her concluding paragraph, seem to get old Glasgow, its mood, its character, its value.\"In Bain Street, close by the Barrowland, there is Saint Lukes, a noted live-music venue, and the award-winning Winged Ox Bar  Kitchen. Other key local venues are the Van Winkle Bourbon BBQ Grill, at  and the award-winning pub. Hielan Jessie, at . WEST Brewery, at the Templeton Building on Glasgow Green, has been flying the flag for the east end for  years.Something, it seems, is stirring in the Gallowgate.Cross the road from the Barrowland and, next door to the adult shop youll see another new venture: The Gate, a lounge bar, a \"modern Scottish pub\", the brainchild of Andy Gemmell, a well-known drinks consultant who is also a columnist on the Herald on Sundays Scottish Le magazine.Together with Tom Joyes, general manager of the Barrowland, Gemmell discloses plans to rebrand the area as the East End Quarter - to, in their words, \"create the visual reason for people to visit East and make it a must-visit neighbourhood in Glasgow.\":The  best seaside pubs in ScotlandMore of The Gate first, though. Its hard to miss, with a vivid yellow diagonal stripe across its facade and front door. It occupies a site that, from next year, will have been home to a remarkable succession of Gallowgate watering-holes for  years. Its quite a thought: since , the year of Scotlands short-lived Radical War, locals have been knocking back beer and whisky in industrial quantities in this very space. Its more recent inhabitants included The Haven, and The Emerald Isle.Gemmell, whose CV has seen him work in award-winning bars and travel the world as a whisky ambassador, speaks with some pride of the history of these premises the fact, for example, that when you enter them, youre in the original close of a tenement that once loomed over the Gallowgate, two centuries ago. Faded uncovered signs, advertising long-forgotten businesses that once traded here, can also be glimpsed.Gemmell knows the area well. His previous role ndash the marketing consultancy, The Drink Cabinet ndash was one of the many businesses based round the corner in East Campbell Street, at the Glasgow Collective, whose founders, brothers John and David McBeth, were, he says, the first to bring a creative side to the Gallowgate. .\"Their premise was to bring young, up-and-coming businesses into the area. Its that basic equation that we see, for example, in Hoxton or Shoreditch [in Londons East End] ndash affordable business space for younger people. I fell in love with the area after that. Its had its issues, its troubles and everything , but I just fell in love with it.\"Three years ago this place came up for sale. It was a good price, and I saw the opportunity. Everyone thought I was mad.\" Why  \"Because of its general reputation, which I felt was exaggerated peoples perception of the area was always asthere was an invisible force-field when you get to The Tron [on the other side of Glasgow Cross from the Gallowgate].\"He notes that both the Trongate and the adjacent Merchant City have been flourishing in terms of bars and entertainment, but laments that \"a stigma\" has attached itself to the Gallowgate. \"There are lots of factors that have given rise to this,\" he argues, \"but people have highlighted these rather than looking at the positives of an amazing village in the middle of Glasgow city centre, with amazing people in it as well. Incredible people. I felt the area has what it takes to be an exciting hub for the city,\"The premises were sitting in now were in a neglected condition when he first saw it. There were, for example, six dferent ceilings, all layered one over the other: \"The place,\" he says, \"was like a Russian doll.\"It was only at the start of this year that he finally decided to focus all his energies on turning the space into The Gate. \"People were steering me off, saying, what are you doing, opening a pub in the Gallowgate \" He knows that a more obvious choice would have been Finnieston, the West End or the Merchant City, \"but I just see the potential down here. I see the potential for the area. If there was an actual physical equation of what makes an area, then the closest Ive seen in the UK isnt Shoreditch or Hoxton. Its a place in Manchester called the Northern Quarter. Its got a live-music venue, a high concentration of licensed premises, and lots of character ndash much, in other words, like the Gallowgate.\"What I wanted to create was a modern pub,\" he adds. \"I grew up in Greenock, my family owned pubs, and what Ive always been obsessed with is the ideology of a pub.\" The decor includes original features, such as fireplaces and oak beams the interior is dark forest green with copper touches, a reclaimed wooden floor and textured tartan wallpaper the gantry is extensive. The toasties include chorizo and chilli jam.:Bioersity projects share fund to boost nature in urban areasGemmell insists that \"gentrication\" of the Gallowgate is absolutely the last thing on his mind. \"As soon as I got the keys for this place, the first thing I did was go across the road and introduce myself to every single person I saw, and told them what I was going to do. I know the old-school way in which things work.\"I couldnt be happier with the way things have gone so far. On the opening night recently I had Stevie, from [nearby] Bar  and his we having a cocktail, alongside many local people, all enjoying the atmosphere. Im not here to gentry anything: Im here to highlight what I think is a great area, and hopefully use my travels and my experience to make this place a success.\"\"Weve just got a feeling for the area,\" Tom Joyes says with emphasis in his wood-led office, deep within the Barrowland Ballroom. \"Not just myself, not just Andy, but everyone in the general area.\"Our company, Maggie McIver Ltd, founded the Barras way back in  and opened the ballroom in . In two years time the market will be a hundred years old.\"Now, in all the  years Ive been here, weve always been in a void so far as the ious authorities ndash Glasgow City Council, the GDA [Glasgow Development Agency], the SDA [Scottish Development Agency], you name it.\"Weve never been city centre, weve never been really east end ndash well, we are east end, but nowhere actually in it: its such a vast place. We were neither one thing nor the other. The void was the word that they all seemed to use.In the wider Gallowgate, Joyes observes that what has been evolving \"are entrepreneurs, artistic types, artisans\". Entertainment has improved, too: the ballroom is gaining in fame and worldwide prestige. And he argues that the area is right on the city centres doorstep, not out in a distant scheme.\"Were in this East End quarter,\" he continues. \"I think you should look at the map of Glasgow and should be seeing Finnieston, the West End, Collegelands, the city centre, Merchant City ndash and the East End Quarter. Its all the city centre, sprawling outwards. The sooner we get a recognised address of where we are, the better.\"He foresees a time when the Barras location can be given as the East End Quarter. \"A nice address it spruces it up a wee bit, to go with the nice streets and things like that.\" More: there could be a time when London Road, and businesses currently based at the Templeton building at Glasgow Green, can also say theyre based in the Quarter. \"Everything gains a wee bit value, a wee bit of prestige, a wee bit of credibility, as the whole area is improving.\"Up until a couple of years ago, Joyes confides, the area around the Barras wasnt a place he would have considered visiting for a meal on a Saturday night, but he and his partner have done just that, several times - BAad, Saint Lukes. He recently took some male members of his family on a pub-crawl. \"I told them we were going to the East End Quarter. They said, whats that  The places we visited were all very pleasant.\"Theres CCTV being installed: the place can only become safer. The streets and pavements have been upgraded. The whole area is evolving. Our message is that, of an evening in the entertainment sides, you can go to Merchant City, or the East End Quarter.\"The group behind the plan for an East End quarter brings together many of the influential people, including Joyes and Gemmell, who are reshaping the Gallowgate. Promotional material, shown to The Herald, speaks of an intention to ldquoshowcase the best of hospitality, music and the arts in The East End of Glasgow.It continues: \"Glasgowrsquos East End, [based] around the iconic Barrowland Ballroom, has seen a resurgence over recent years with some great food and drink operators and creatives hustling hard to drive tourism and bring a new focus to the area.\"It is our mission to create a  to showcase these erse venues, the people, music and attractions, to propel Glasgowrsquos East End Quarter into the spotlight as the lsquoplace to gorsquo.\"There will be heavy promotion of #EastEndQuarter across Instagram and Facebook, and, the material says, \"we will create beautul photography, immersive video and styled posts to champion East End Quarter businesses, attractions, art venues, people and more, with a strategic plan that engages stakeholders and visitors.\"Tourism will play a key part. \"There is so much potential for tourism and we will galvanise operators and businesses in the area to collaborate and thrive together.

I am here today to ensure that we hit the ground running in making that happen and to reassure Fergusonrsquos excellent staff of the governmentrsquos commitment.ldquoPublic control will provide much-needed continuity of employment now and ensure the completion of the ferry contracts at the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer.\"It is absolutely essential that the outstanding contracts to build these two ferries are completed in order to sustain the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services network and provide vital support for the economies of our island communities.ldquoThe alternative was for the government to stand aside while the company went into administration, resulting in the jobs being lost and the vessels not being completed.

They came behind the SNP and Plaid Cymru in single seats and behind Labour in seven. But they are the second place challengers to the Tories in .They recently picked up one of those in last monthrsquos Brecon  Radnorshire byelection, but you get the picture.If the LibDems are to build on the momentum of the EU election, in which proportional representation greatly helped them, they must defeat sitting Tory MPs under the much tougher first-past-the-post system.If they help install Mr Corbyn in Downing Street, even for a few days to extend the Brexit deadline and call an election, those incumbent Tories will use that against them at every turn.You can see the posters now. A giant Nicola Sturgeon with a smaller Mr Corbyn in her pocket and Ms Swinson tucked into his, like a set of Russian dolls.The other opposition parties will be making similar calculations about the next election too, of course. But they face less pain than the LibDems.:Humza Yousaf says he struggles with the name of the SNP and its connotationsThe SNP are consistently high in the polls and see little threat from Mr Corbynrsquos plan. Better, they may even get a snf of Indyref. And itrsquos not astheir Tory opponents in the north-east could get even angrier at the Nationalists.Labour meanwhile would love to be able to go into an election with ldquoRe-elect Jeremy Corbyn as a slogan after their leader had had a dry run at the job.So when Mr Corbyn proposed talks on a time-limited government of national unitywith him at the helm, it was understandable that Ms Swinson instantly discounted it as ldquononsense.The Labour leader could never persuade a majority of MPs to support the idea, including many Labour MPs, far less would-be Tory rebels, so it wasnrsquot worth considering, she said.Nor does she trust Mr Corbyn. Besides his endless havering on Brexit, she has said she regards him as a danger to national security and the economy.She may be right about all of the above, but she was still wrong to dismiss it.The proposal is a useful thing per se. It gets the ball-rolling and the parties talking. What,anything, emerges from those talks may be a quite dferent plan. But the main thing for Remainers now is to put a sht in and arrive at a workable scheme. Mr Corbynrsquos invitation to parley has at least got that process underway.It also forces Remainers to face up to the fact that passing a no-confidence vote in Boris Johnsonrsquos government is not sufficient to stop no-deal. You canrsquot spend half a fiver. You need a credible plan to give value to the first part.Indeed, without knowing what comes next, Tory rebels are unlikely to vote no-confidence and end their political careers. If Remainers ever find it, the missing piece may turn out to be a GNU or emergency legislation or some other improbable novelty. No one knows. And so you have to keep all options open.Following that logic, Nicola Sturgeon was right to say she could work with Mr Corbyn to stop no-deal. She later said she wasnrsquot a fan, and would prefer not to start from here, but, hey, needs must.Even Sarah Wollaston, the former Tory MP turned LibDem, accepted the Labour leader may be ldquothe lesser of two evils when set against no-deal.There are a lot of mind games and brinkmanship around no-deal.With his lsquodo or diersquo promise about October , Mr Johnson is trying to create a sense of inevitability about Brexit and instil fatalism in his opponents. The mop-topped Moses hopes theyrsquoll part like the Red Sea and let him bumble into the promised land.Despite leakers reportedly being threatened with the sack, his government keeps leaking tit-bits to reinforce this.

A majority are pensioners. Only four of them are children.FULL STORY:Spain to copy the Highlands on stopping people exodusMs Acedo, from local public broadcaster CMM, is doing vox pops, vox populi, where there is barely a populus to have a voice.ldquoHalf the houses are shut up, said one middle-aged woman in the street. ldquoThere are entire barrios, neighbourhoods, that are nearly closed, added another.One interviewee, an elderly woman standing in Torrejoncillorsquos deserted main square, sums up why her community is dying. ldquoThere was no work, ldquo she tells Ms Acedo, ldquoand the people emigrated.It is more than a year since CMM TV covered the depopulation of Torrejoncillo. That came after figures showed the town had lost % of its population in  alone.But this one town is just part of a bigger picture. It is in Cuenca region, part of Castilla-La Mancha whose population has dropped a third since the beginning of the th century, a period that has included a civil war, depression and decades of authoritarian right rule.Cuenca region is, along with the Arctic north of the Nordic world, is suffering the steepest depopulation in the European Union.Local authorities and business and civic society lobbies in the region - whose stunning capital, also Cuenca, is famed for its homes hanging from its clfs - think they have a solution. They want to copy Scotland and its half-century long effort to keep people in the Highlands and Islands.Last week Pedro Saacutenchez, Spainrsquos acting prime minister, took an interest in the scheme at a depopulation summit.Cuenca, along with neighbouring Soria, also in Castilla La Mancha, and Teruel in Aragon, is part of an international network called Southern Sparsely Populated Areas or SSPA.They are joined by a Croatiarsquos biggest county by area, Lika-Senj and Evrytania, a mountainous region of central Greece. These areas are being hollowed out.Impoverished Lika-Senj, despite being home to some of Croatiarsquos top tourist sites, such as the deep blue Plitvice Lakes and waterfalls, is haemorrhaging people.Plitvice LakesIts population was estimated at , in mid-.

Young people leave.It is easy to see therefore why Scotlandrsquos efforts look like a success from afar.After all, there are around as many people in the Highlands and Islands as there were in the middle of the th century.A hundred thousand souls have been added to the region - which includes Moray, most of Argyll and Bute, as well as Arran and the Cumbraes on the Firth of Clyde - since Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson created the old Highlands and Islands Development Boardin .VIEWPOINT:Brian Wilson: the unfinished business of the Highlands and Islands Development BoardNobody in Scotland thinks the job is done - eventhe post Clearances population decline has been effectively reversed.HIDB has morphed in to Highlands and Islands Enterprise or HIE but it still has a fundamental remit: giving people a reason to live in the region.That is because, those close to development projects stress, there are still communities on the very edge of viability. Scotland has its Torrejoncillos, such as islands which are just one family leaving away from losing their schools.ldquoOrkney or Oban might be booming, said one source. ldquoBut there are still parts of the Western Isles or the Cowal peninsula that are losing people.More people are dying in Outer Hebrides than are being born.

They want to politics-proof re-population.SSPA, funded by the European Union and ious regional governments, produced a major report on the Highlands and Islands. One of its main conclusions was the importance of having ldquoa strategy and an agency of great autonomy to guarantee long-term continuous action.

On the assumption that they wont be willing to do so, the best option must surely be to pass a bill that extends Article  in order to allow a Peoples Vote referendum. Then we can all go out and bring this sorry debacle to an end.Andrew Chamberlain, Glasgow.NICOLA Sturgeon accuses the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, of being \"daft\" . Nothing could be further from the truth. Ms Swinson is being a genuine politician standing up for what her party believes in without resorting to fake attraction to others. She understands that this sudden \"love\", by the SNP, for Labour is only a ploy in regards to Labours new position, it seems, vis a vis another Scottish independence referendum.Ms Sturgeon used to be seen as an astute politician. No longer. Such brazen attempts to obtain indyref by any means possible simply exposes the lack of a true ability to persuade a sceptical population of the merits of independence. In doing so, she has completely wrecked the careful build up of this idea by her predecessor, Alex Salmond. To go from around  per cent acceptance of independence to  per cent was the easy bit. Gaining more is an uphill struggle. Fake friendship with Labour will not do it, nor will getting other party leaders on board who will only destroy their own credibility.Independence needs a firm foundation to be viable both in the short and long terms. Nothing the SNP has posited suggest this will be the case, hence the need to try to gain it by the back door.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.I THINK Ian Blackford is right. All parties should work together to stop Boris Johnsons No Deal. The \"advisory\" Brexit referendum was achieved through lies peddled by the Leave campaign.Dominic Cummings, the Leave mastermind is now at the heart of government directing the UK leaving the EU without a deal, accelerating the UKs descent into economic and political decline. We cannot allow this to happen.Stuart Baillie Strong, Edinburgh EH.I MUST admire Jo Swinsons barefaced political arrogance, trying to replace the leader of the official opposition with Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman, both wise enough to keep their own counsel, on the subject of an Emergency government.May I remind Ms Swinson that Jeremy Corbyn was elected by more than , Labour members and supporters. Although it looks unlikely that Mr Corbyn will ever become Prime Minister, democratically he still should be given the opportunity.Since recently becoming leader of the LibDems, Ms Swinson has stated that she is willing to form a coalition with the Tories, and that she would not work with the SNP, even though it is the third-largest party in Westminster.As Ms Swinson parades in the media circus, claiming to be a Liberal and Democrat, lets examine her previous voting record -: Voted for the bedroom tax, the trebling of tuition fees, supported housing benefit cuts, invalidity and benefit sanctions, cuts to youth employment funding, voted in favour of the mansion tax and finally. voted  times with the Tories.After seeing this the electorate of her constituency, East Dunbartonshire, must surely conclude Ms Jo Swinson is neither liberal nor democratic, and that she is not representing their opinions and views, but is instead self promoting her own political agenda and making herself more electable to Southern Britain.Robert McCaw, Renfrew.I WOULD remind Peter A Russellthat the political landscape in Scotland, the UK and the EU is unrecognisable from that of five years ago, when Scotland was assured that only by remaining within the UK could we secure our place in Europe. Now, with Scotland dragged to the edge of the hard Brexit clf, it is heartening that not one EU country has declared that they will oppose an independent Scotlands membership of the EU. Elma Brok, the former MEP, and considered to be one of the foremost authorities on the EU constitution has said \"it would be easy to have membership negotiations because Scotland fulfils all the needs for membership\", Spanish Minister Josep Borrell has said Scotland would be accepted into the EUit voted for independence, Manfred Weber, leader of the European People Partys Group, Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group and Gunther Kirchbaum, head of the Bundestag Committee for EU affairs have all made supportive comments regarding Scotland becoming a member of the EU. And Ursula von der Leyen, elected as President of the EU Commission has expressed herself as a fan of Nicola Sturgeon, and stated that she knew \"first hand how the debates in the UK are. So respect and good luck\".An independent Scotland would be, not a surly neighbour, but an enthusiastic friend to our fellow  EU nations. And in the sphere of practical politics, the EU would surely welcome as number , Scotland, a country rich in natural resources and a major oil producing nation.Ruth Marr, Stirling.WE are told that Alf Smithdemanded a -year warranty for a washing machine when he was  years old. Anyone looking for similar reassurance for a long and comfortable future would be well advised not to buy anything at all from Messrs Johnson and Sturgeon, shameless peddlers both of uncertainty, immense economic risk and certain misery for those least able to cope with economic downturns.

Take the box indoors away from flies.If the hedgehog isn’t bleeding, offering a warm wrapped hot water bottle is good first aid, but do make sure there is room for it to get offit gets too warm and ensure the bottle is not allowed to go cold.Offer some meaty cat or dog food and water but don’t force feed it.Once you’ve done that, call a local hedgehog rescue centreyou know of one, or BHPS on    for further advice and local contacts.If it’s a baby, Fay says you should check for siblings.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances that led up to the incident\"  Appeal for information following suspicious fire in Peterhead viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"“Hoglets don’t usually come in ones,” she said. “If a hoglet it is trouble, its brothers and sisters may well need help too, so do look around vicinity for others.” She added: “Acting quickly could literally mean the dference between le and death.

Now we want to reach out to the public and local organisations theand breadth of Scotland to get their feedback.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to consider the new strategy and to join the conversation. “The consultation is available online but we will also be going out to communities across rural, island and urban locations in the next  weeks where it would be great to hear as many views as possible.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Colin points out a wall during the Bennachie dig.\"  Open day for people to see dig at Bennachie viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"The strategy aims to protect our climate as well as meeting the needs of its people and businesses.It’s a fine balancing act but the government believes the strategy will tackle climate change, help the economy prosper and improve our health and well-being. There will also be more accountability with proposals for citizens’  and a delivery board.However, the strategy only provides a broad overview of the direction the government is taking, rather than a detailed action plan.Michael explained: “It sets out the direction we will be travelling in for the next  years, with the clear intention that this will not sit on a shelf gathering dust.“The delivery plan, which will be released when the strategy is finalised, will be updated every year to see how much progress has been made on the objectives.“That plan will contain far more detail on what we, as a government, plan to do to meet our targets.”While the government will, of course, lead the way, every Scot has a part to play in the strategy – particularly when it comes to our climate.Michael said: “Scotland has the most ambitious targets for tackling climate change in the world.“The Climate Change Bill, currently before the Scottish Parliament, includes an increased ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a net-zero emissions target by .“Transport is currently the largest contributor to Scottish emissions.“This will be tackled through a range of actions including an ambition to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by .“We will promote and design our transport system so that walking, cycling, public and shared transport are promoted ahead of private car use.“However, we also need to help people make the transition to lower carbon travel – to walk or cycle for short journeys,they are able to, or use public transport ahead of single driver car journeys.“That will not only help to reduce car emissions, which are currently responsible for the most greenhouse gas emissions, but will also help people become more active, improving their health and well-being.“There is no doubt in my mind that our climate is changing. The Beast from the East ably proved that.“It cost the UK economy at least £ billion per day as gridlocked roads and no trains or buses meant many workers were unable to get into work.“We are experiencing more severe winter weather, coupled with summers which are hotter and wetter.“That should serve as a real wake up call to us all that we need to change our behaviours now.“Government has a major part to play but we each also have a personal, inidual responsibility to take action to ensure we minimise the impact that we’re having on the environment.“We have to get this right for future generations, given the impact it could have on their lives.”Michael admits that it may be a struggle to wean people away from their cars.For the car remains the dominant mode of transport in Scotland. In ,  per cent of all journeys were made either as drivers or passengers in a car or a van. This was up from  per cent in  and  per cent in .The proportion of single occupancy car trips also shows an increasing trend. The figure of  per cent in  compares with  per cent in  and  per cent in .But with  per cent of Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions caused by transport, and cars being responsible for the lion’s share, our love affair with the car has to change.It’s for that reason the Scottish Government is moving fast to rid our streets of petrol and diesel cars.The move to electric cars by  – the most ambitious target in the UK – should help meet the emissions target.It has also recently introduced low emission zones in Glasgow city centre, with Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen set to follow.However, with bus trips also in decline, the government has a major job to do in persuading people to change their habits.Michael said: “We need to encourage people to make greater use of public transport.“That, in turn, will help reduce congestion in our cities and towns – as well as reducing emssions.“A double decker bus can take up to  passengers while occupying little more road space than a single car.“Bus use generally has been in decline since the s for a number of reasons, one being longer journey times caused by congestion on the network.“If we can tackle that, people will be more inclined to travel by bus once again.”Technology, both existing and yet to be dreamed up, will also have a role to play.Michael added: “The rail electrication project proves what we can do – we need to be ready and able to introduce new technologies.“However, what people want today and in  years is the same– linking people and places in ways that are reliable, affordable and safe.“Our strategy will be a catalyst for change. “By focusing on our priorities and delivering the outcomes, Scotland will have a transport system that demonstrates to the world that it is open for business.”The strategy opened for public consultation on Wednesday, July , and will close on Wednesday, October .The consultation team will be going out to train and bus stations across the country in the coming weeks to guage public opinion.Members of the public are also being encouraged to have their say online.Visit consult.gov.scot transport-scotland national-transport-strategy to have your say.

Please feel free to contact us with any questions by phoning  ,# said those involved.A spokesperson for the project went on to say: “A huge thanks to all the landowners who have helped us by agreeing the essential land access we need to get started.

They will be checked regularly by the project staff.The Orkney Native Wildle Project is a partnership between Orkney Islands Council, Scottish Natural Heritageand RSPB Scotland. Following three years of development generous support for the project has been provided by, the Heritage Lottery Fund and EU Le, providing a combined grant of £. million for the duration of the five-year project.Stoats are native to the UK Mainland but not to Orkney, where they were first recorded in . Since then the population has increased rapidly and is now fully established and widely-distributed throughout Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.

Striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult. Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, enabling them to control goose numbers sustainably, and sell goose meat for profit.”Until now, meat generated by the Orkney resident greylag goose project could only be sold locally by retailers based on Orkney.SNH is working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland.

No doubt our very own Prince Philip will have been pulling the strings, emboldened from ordering the security service to make the deaths of our very own Diana, the People’s Princess, and Dodi Fayed look like an ‘accident’ back in . Dedicated conspiracy theorists understand this, to suggest otherwise is akin to being seen out with your best mate who’s wearing an ‘I’m with this Idiot’ t-shirt. Duh.However, there comes a point in everyone’s le, say around the age of , where you have to put down the joint and the beef-flavoured Monster Munch and leave the conspiracy theories to the likes of Netflix.: : It’s great fun discussing who shot JFK with your mates , be it down the boozer or in the comfort of your own home, after the Wall’s Viennetta has been served with Simply Red playing gently in the background.But in my experience these types of encounters can often act as a social tell, like a poor poker player giving their hand away. If without really noticing it, the conversation veers from fake moon landings towards “the Rothschilds control everything” or “MI rigged the  Indy referendum” then chances are you’ve got a KP nutter on your hands and next time it might be besttheir homemade lasagne stays at home with them. Gently guide them on their way as you hand back the six cans of Kestrel Super Premium Lager they brought. Bless. Be seeing ya. This kind of nonsense can easily creep in to these types of chats and all too often goes largely unchecked.Without wanting to sound overly harsh, you’re definitely a bit of a saddoyou’re still hankering after conspiracy theories to explain why le hasn’t quite panned out the way you expected by the time you’ve hit your s. Stuck in a boring - office job, we, kids and the boss doing your nut in, drinking a wee bit too much and not clearing the overdraft Easy, that’s the fault of shadowy elites who have infiltrated HR, ensuring that only young people who understand the bloody computers and something called ‘digital’ get promoted. Yip, the deep state has genuinely conspired to stop you – Rab fi Leith – from getting oan in the world. Pass the herb.Most of the ‘really good’ conspiracy theories come from the US and are borne out of people’s fears and a desire to understand the basic question: how could that happen They often evolve from a perceived failing of the state to protect, be it the le of a president or a politician in the case of JFK or his brother Robert who were both gunned down in their prime. It feels like our personal security has been compromised in some way. The   terrorist attacks are a great example of how conspiracy theories evolve. In this case, they range from a controlled demolition contributing to the collapse of the Twin Towers caused by government insiders to the bringing down of the mysterious World Trade Center  building which housed the CIA and Secret Service – as part of a cover-up to hide state complicity in the attacks. And United Airlines Flight  was shot down by fighter jets before it could reach the White House.In this conspiracy-driven environment, hundredsnot thousands of eye-witness accounts are pushed aside in favour of a narrative chosen by those who spend too much time sitting in their Y-fronts browsing the internet.The desire to push the truth to one side in this instance seems overwhelming for some. Nineteen hijackers armed with nothing more than craft knives – or Stanley knives like the football casuals of the s – hijacked, then weaponised three out of four planes, murdering around , people in the richest, most powerful country in the world. The knock-on effect of this was two wars – one in Iraq, which had as much to do with the   attacks as Iceland – at a total cost that is still running into the trillions. It’s no surprise some folk embrace conspiracy theory alternatives when the truth, as was the case on  September, , is so shocking to accept.The list of conspiracy theories is endless, a shopping list of bampottery from the Flat Earth Society to anti-vaccination types, global warming deniers and everything in between. Believers clearly haven’t got over being lied to as kids and I do have a modicum of sympathy with this. From our first steps, we’re fed a constant stream of lies, designed to regulate our behaviour – Santa will take you off his list, look what the the tooth fairy has brought in the middle of the night, and the police will come and take you away to the school for bad boys.In this environement, it’s no wonder some ‘damaged people’ seek their own alternative truth.

Like most parts of the world, we have more reasons to be ashamed of ourselves than just one. How many of us can say we have never heard a racist word spoken : Edinburgh Festivals : Bringing Red Dust Road to the stageFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereSo when Jackie Kay, Scotland’s Makar, says Scotland is decades behind cities in England when it comes to tackling racism and facing up to this country’s participation in the slave trade, we should listen.Kay, born to a Nigerian father and a Scottish mother in Edinburgh, said in Scotland “it seems to be acceptable to keep on asking people where they are from in the way that you just don’t do with a black Liverpudlian, a black Brummie or a black Londoner. You can’t accept that now, in ... It’s not just about people being there and a erse population, it’s about how we actually change our image of ourselves when we think of what it means to be Scottish.”In a world where the far-right is on the march – quite literally in places like Charlottesville, Virginia – and ‘identitarianism’, which is just racism and fascism in an ‘alt-right’ disguise, Scotland has bucked the trend. Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP and every other mainstream political party have stood foursquare in opposition to the kind of hate-filled populist nationalism that has attracted considerable support in places like Hungary.But that doesn’t mean we can be in any way complacent. It’s not accurate to call Scotland a “racist country”, but it’s equally untrue to say that we do not have a problem with racism, equally wrong to think we can simply ignore the evils of the slave trade – which still echo in our society today – in discussions about our history.Kay’s point is quite a subtle, philosophical one. As we go about our everyday lives, it’s not all that often that we contemplate “our image of ourselves”. But it is important to do so, because it is something that informs our day-to-day interactions with other people.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why the greens are wrong over catholic education representatives john mclellan","story":"As long as we have Catholic schools, it#s not unreasonable to have church representatives on council education committees, writes John McLellan.It is a sign of the febrile political times in which we live that, in pondering over this week’s column, I quickly concluded that even for someone brought up in a Rangers-supporting, Protestant Glasgow household it would be easier to write about Catholic schools than Brexit.In the two years since I was elected as a Conservative councillor , there is no question the letter-writing campaign orchestrated by the Catholic Church to fight a Green Party move to strip church representatives on Edinburgh’s education committee of voting rights is the strongest cross-city protest we have received.Yes, we get bombarded with cut-and-paste anti-Zionist complaints about the Lothian Pension Fund’s investment in the Israeli Bank Hapoalim, but this is dferent after Archbishop Leo Cushley’s condemnation was read from pulpits a few weeks back, scores of hand-written letters and Catholic Church postcards arrive every day to demand that voting rights are preserved.The place of three religious representatives on Scottish education committees is a statutory guarantee, going back to the  Education Act when ‘voluntary’ Catholic schools were brought into a new state system along with board schools and given the same funding under new county education authorities.: Archbishop brands removal of church education committee voting rights as ‘a serious threat’ to future of faith schoolsFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereNext week Edinburgh Council will vote on a Green Party proposal to remove voting rights following a similar move in Perth  Kinross after religious representatives sealed the fate of Blairingone Primary, a school near Dollar with just six pupils which the council administration was recommending for closure because it only had the prospect of five more.In Edinburgh, the same situation is unlikely to arise because of a convention that the religious representatives only vote on matters directly related to faith-based education, and as yet no-one has been able to point to an issue in which the religious representatives have caused controversy or swung a decision against a political majority. In Edinburgh, this is an issue looking for a problem. This week, an editorial in the Scottish Catholic Observer didn’t pull its punches, saying that while the Green Party had some good ideas “a strain of absolute lunacy also runs through it... The party is arrogant and blindly devoted to its cause. ‘Religion is bad, therefore state-funded religious schools are bad’ is their thinking.”The Church regards undermining the place of religious representatives as the start of a process which will lead to the dismantling of Catholic schools and so presents a threat to the entire system, pointing to the history of discrimination as evidence of their continued relevance.While claims that Catholics face an ever-present threat of sectarian exclusion might still have some substance in small pockets in the West, in the East of Scotland it is weak to say the least. But not so the threat to Catholic identity of which, in an increasingly secular age, the schools are an essential part, and as Catholicism is an essential part of Scotland’s heritage this is something which should be valued and understood.But the schools also represent state-supported choice in education, which councils did so much to destroy in the s with the dismantling of historic institutions like the Royal High, the High School of Glasgowand Allan Glen’s. Like those schools, the choice they represent is one of improving standards. There might be a pointCatholic schools and their representatives were a drag on attainment and a threat to their children’s learning, but the opposite is the case with Catholic schools consistently out-performing their non-denominational neighbours.Judging by the attack on private school funding and the withdrawal from all but one international education measurement system, comparison and competition spell danger for the Scottish Government and eroding the position of Catholic schools would be one more step down that road.The Edinburgh Green Party’s position has grown from their enthusiasm for giving children the day off to go on climate strikes to a desire to give pupil representatives a place on the education committee, but realising this is a non-starter it has decided thatthe kids can’t have a say then neither can the churches. This article started with a declaration of my background and some will no doubt argue that in itself is an illustration of a problem which separate schooling perpetuates. But ersity and choice is not the same as ision and as long as there are Catholic schools then giving the Church one voice on matters which directly affect the faith in those institutions does not seem to be controversial. The Green Party has chosen to make it so. As they say, hell mend them.Say no to Hangover DayOn choice, shops currently can choose whether to open on Ne’er Day, but a Holyrood motion from Labour MSP Jackie Baillie bids to force large shops to close to give staff a guaranteed break.

For once not the main event, Gordon Brown was on stage at the Edinburgh Book Festival this week to interview Serbian economist Branko Milanovic about his new book Capitalism Alone: The Future of the System That Rules the World. “It’s a privilege to be interviewed by a Prime Minister,” said Milanovic, to which Mr Brown quickly replied, “Former Prime Minister. I’m unemployed.” Aw.An expert on income inequality, Mr Milanovic’s book ides global capitalism into two categories: liberal capitalism, such as the UK and US, and political capitalism, like China and Russia, the former characterised by self-perpetuating affluent middle upper classes, the latter by corruption. He did not offer an alternative and many in the audience would have been disappointed about his view that global capitalism offered the best way to reduce global income inequality.

Neils grandmother is in the centre of the centre row.He said: “A good friend of mine owned a bar in Dromore, she gave me an old bottle that said ‘ginger beer’ on it. It was meant as a joke because I’m ginger, but it ended up starting a fascination with bottles.“I started looking into where the bottles were made and background to them.“My original intent was to collect a bottle from every county, but soon I found out there are a lot of bottles out there, probably  known bottles. They are very dficult to find. I would hunt through antique shops, flea markets, auctions and that type of thing. You also pick some up by word of mouth or even dig them up from an old dump site.“My collection ranges from Coleraine to Cork, but a number of local bottles have eluded me. I am aware of bottles from Lurgan, Portadown and Banbridge but am yet to locate these. In particular, the Crystal Mineral Water company in Banbridge produced some fantastic stoneware bottles and it would be the pinnacle of my collection to add one of these.” The bottle from the Crystal Mineral Company in Banbridge that Neil would love to add to his collectionExplaining the history of stoneware bottles, he said: “They were produced during the Victorian era, late s, early s, and were all hand made. No two bottles are the same due to the processes involved, but the minor flaws are what add to their charm. “Historically stone bottles were gradually replaced by mass produced glass bottles, the result of which is that many of these were buried in landfill sites or dumped in rivers and canals and can be dficult to locate.”Neil added: “I’ve always had a big interest in local social history, these stoneware bottles are part of it. I have been working hard in documenting the past so that it can be preserved for future generations. “I have amassed a collection of local items, everything from clocks to water pumps, but there are a few items that I have struggled to find. I am keen to locate any stoneware bottles from Banbridge and anything relating to the Dunbar McMaster spinning mill in Gilford.”He said: “I was born in Gilford into one of the mill workers houses owned by the Dunbar McMaster company and my family were historically mill workers there. I have a fantastic photo of my grandmother working in the mill taken during the Coronation in . I am seeking anything relating to the mill and its history such as receipts, packaging or advertising or even furniture.”Neil commented: “I am part of a local history group, who meet regularly to discuss past events and places and we regularly showcase items so that they can be shared by all.“I would really love to put on an exhibition in Banbridge and that’s probably where this is going.”Open Day raises over £, Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Sadly Neil’s we Kate doesn’t share his enthusiasm for artefacts from the past: “She thinks it’s a load of junk, she’s a minimalist.”If you can help Neil add to his collection email him at neilreid@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed the 20 ni sights on lonely planet s ultimate uk travel guide","story":"The Giant#s Causeway has been ranked as the UK#s third best tourist destination by respected travel guide Lonely Planet, finishing ahead of attractions such as Hadrian#s Wall and London#s Tate Modern art gallery.For the first time Lonely Planet has picked its  most unmissable experiences and hidden gems across Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands to form its ultimate UK travel hitlist.Titanic Belfast was also ranked in the top  UK destinations by Lonely PlanetIn total,  sights and experiences in Northern Ireland feature in the list which was unveiled today, including the Crown Liquor Saloon in Belfast, Rathlin Island and Londonderry’s walls.Out of the score of attractions only one is in Co Armagh , while none of the sights in Co Tyrone feature in the Lonely Planet must see list.Welcoming the news, Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: “The inclusion of  Northern Ireland experiences and attractions – including the Giant’s Causeway at number three – in Lonely Planet’s ‘Ultimate UK Travelist’ is good news and will surely help to inspire GB travellers to put Northern Ireland on their holiday wish-list. “It is another well-deserved accolade for all of these attractions, which provides Tourism Ireland with a great hook to continue to promote Northern Ireland as a ‘must visit’ destination.”Lonely Planet’s VP of Experience, Tom Hall, said: “Lonely Planet’s Ultimate United Kingdom Travelist brings together the UK’s most compelling sights and experiences, ranging from world-class museums and giant cathedrals to rollicking festivals, inky lochs and tiny pubs. “We’re thrilled to name the Giant’s Causeway one of the UK’s very best sights - alongside many other wonderful experiences in Northern Ireland including spotting puffins and seals on Rathlin Island and riding a boat through Co Fermanagh’s Marble Arch Caves.”Giant’s Causeway is described by Lonely Planet as “timeless” and “unrepeatable” and is beaten only by the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and London’s British Museum.The Ultimate UK Travelist is available at a cost of £..

While helping families move out of the burned streets of Clonard, Gerald, a member of the Fianna youth, was shot dead by on Waterville Street, not far from his Colinward Street family home. During the Scarman tribunal, an acting superior of Clonard Monastery spoke of how he had given Gerald and three others hit by shotgun blasts the last rites. Gerald was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital where he was pronounced dead at .pm. The tribunal concluded he had been shot by a Protestant gunman. Speaking to the Andersonstown News Gerald’s -year-old mother Nellie spoke of how her second oldest child was born on the Feast of St Gerard and how much he loved fishing, birds, motor racing and bikes. “I remember when Gerald left school, he went to St Thomas’, he got himself a job in a factory in Northumberland Street. I remember he was working in it around three weeks and he came home and said ‘Mummy, the boss wants to see you.’ The first thing I asked was ‘What have you done ’ I went down and the man praised Gerald, how much of a good, clean worker he was and told me how much he had in common with his own sons. He told me how he wanted Gerald to go to the Tech come September but that Gerald had told him how he wanted to join the Irish Merchant Navy when he came of age. I saidthat’s his wish I can’t hold him back.”Nellie spoke of how on August   she had gone out to look for Gerald as he hadn’t come home.Telling how fraught the roads around Kashmir, Falls and Albert Street had become as violence flared around her and her son Jim as they looked for Gerald. “I remember Gerald came in around am that night and went to bed. I got up the next morning to go to work, I worked in C#A as a cleaner and I turned on the news. It was saying about Patrick Rooney, Trooper McCabe and the fella, the bus driver from Ardoyne who had been killed. I came home later that day and Gerald was in the house with his friend. I said to him ‘Waren’t you in work ’ He said ‘Mummy, there is no work, it’s gone, it’s away.’ He went straight out again and that was the last I saw him.”Nellie said she went out to look for Gerald as trouble continued to flare and found herself at the City Hospital. “I remember the Sister on the ward brought me into the office and I said to her that I was looking for my son. She went out and came back and I will always remember how she said ‘No mother, he’s not here, there’s only a boy of around  in Musgrave.’ I said that’s him, that’s Gerald. “Gerald was a big lad, he had it in the shoulders, he had a big frame and he wore a size  shoe. I remember later a priest being on the other side of the street from our house, he was wearing a heavily beaded vest, a beret and a stick and said ‘Mrs McAuley your son has gone to Heaven,’ then he turned on his heel and walked away.”Following Gerald’s death Nellie recalled her feelings: “You’re here and you’re not here. About six weeks after Gerard was buried we were invited up to the old Felons at the side of the cemetery and that night they had a colour party come on the stage and said that night that Gerard was in the Fianna from  years old. Looking back on it Gerald asked me could he go away for a week with the boys out of school. I remember he said he needed five shillings and could I give it to him. He said he needed an enamel plate, cup, mug and even then the penny didn’t drop. I brought him down to Millets and we got the plate, everything. The fella in the shop said he would need a wee container to carry his eggs in and we got that as well. Soon after he came in to say ‘Mummy I’m awful sorry some of the boys couldn’t get their money and couldn’t go.’ I don’t know how long after that then he did go.”  years on from the anniversary of Gerald’s death on Thursday, Nellie reflected how she “wasn’t ing right” half a century ago.” “I never had any hatred. Gerald died on the Feast of the Assumption, August , that’s Her day, he was taken on Her day and that’s the way I looked at it.” A wreath-laying ceremony for Gerald McAuley will take on Friday, August  at .pm in Bombay Street Memorial Garden.

I played guitar with Brian and haven’t seen him since his illness and now that he is cancer free, it will be good to see him.”On composing one of the most iconic songs of the s, Broken Land, Pat explained how he had been “messing about” on producer Garry Bell’s keyboards. “I got my daughter to school that Monday morning and the main part of the song was done that day,” he said.Still heavily rotated on airwaves  plus years later, Pat said there are lots of songs written that could appear on a new Adventures album. “I think we are playing better now than back in the day, I don’t know why, maybe we are all more experienced. I’d like to put a new album out and give the people that come to see, that are coming to see us, that new work, new material to sing along to.”Pat spoke of how the band are already looking to  with a series of gigs already lined up. “I have a lot of material and it’s a matter of putting it all down and getting it out there. There is a great studio in Antrim, Einstein Studios, and that’s where we will go to do the work. “We have the Empire Music Hall booked for January and the Forever Young festival in Dublin. We are also performing at a benefit night in memory of Gerry Anderson at the Grand Opera House with all proceeds going towards cancer charities and the Greatest Hits gig at the end of August.”To vote for your ‘greatest hit’ visit www.belfastmediagroup belfasts-greatest-hits-nominations.

From  stylish bedrooms, a stunning bar with an extensive drinks and cocktails menu and even an eye-catching garden and bridal suite, the Lansdowne has it all.As for grub, the Lansdowne caters for diners from AM to PM and a recent Thursday lunchtime visit for myself and two colleagues offered us the chance to sample some dishes from their lunch menu.The menu is made up of light bites, small plates and main plates so your choice depends on just how hungry you are and how much time you have. We were greeted and shown to our table by their new yet welcoming staff and joined for lunch on this occasion by co-owner Jim McLaughlin who took little time in doing the work for us by selecting some of his favourite and most popular dishes from across the lunch menu. Jim’s background is in food, so we had no hesitation he would deliver the right goods to the table.It wasn’t long before our huge selection of grub arrived in front of us and left us with the question, where to begin We were served three main plates – the larger courses on the Lansdowne lunch menu. First up was the simple yet classic Chicken Caesar salad – a generous portion of sliced chargrilled chicken mixed in with maple-cured bacon lardons, baby gem lettuce, garlic focaccia croutons and lashed with parmesan shavings drizzled in Caesar dressing. Often known as the not so healthy salad option for dieters, it would have been rude not to try this classic and spoonful after spoonful, the smorgasbord of flavours really came out. The next main plate was the duck confit, served on a bed of sweet potato mash, green beans with a dash of herb butter and red wine jus. For me, it was quite the standout dish and as a duck lover, it hit all the right spots from the crispiness on the outside to the easily torn-off meat on the inside, all brought to le by the sweet potato mash and red wine jus.The last of the main plates was my colleague’s definition of heaven – a huge pot of steamed mussels in garlic and white wine cream and served with rosemary and red onion focaccia bread. A massive lover of all things fish, the silence at the table was noticeable as she made her way through the portion, which, priced at just £, could easily be shared amongst two.Also served up on this lunchtime occasion was a selection of small plates which are proving the most popular choice od customers, according to Jim. Small plates are exactly what they say on the tin and take a form similar to Spanish tapas, meaning they are ideal to share. Customers can choose  for £,  for £ or  for £ so whether you want a nibble over a drink or simply can’t choose and need to try a few, the world is your oyster at the Lansdowne.For me, the stand-out small plate was the crispy pork belly with a layer of caramel apple sauce. Pork belly is one of my favourite things and, having previously worked in a Chinese restaurant, I am all too familiar with it and this did not disappoint.Another triumph was the firecracker chicken wings, served with a blue cheese dip. The wings were a perfect combination of a fiery wsoon overtaken by the wonderful dip – I would highly recommend.The brie also deserves a paragraph to itself because it was simply mouth-watering. A crispy shell was soon followed by the delicious melted delight that is brie but the dish was really taken to the next level by the homemade blackcurrant gel and it is not dficult to see why it is the most popular side dish order, according to Jim.Also served to us on small plates was the crispy beef: large chunks of beef brisket which were cooked to perfection and beautully seasoned with pickled carrot and a tastebud tingling Asian dressing which ensured the beef inside the crispiness was moist and melting.The deep fried salt and chilli squid was equally as good and something I also adore – well, anything salt and chilli really. The squid was fresh, fried expertly and served with a napa salad, harissa mayo, coriander and sesame seeds, it would put some Chinese restaurants’ attempt at the dish to shame.The small plates were a huge success on our visit and enjoyed in the impressive surroundings of the stylish bar, for me it was exactly how ‘bar food’ should be – in fact, it was on another level. I cannot wait to try some of the other small plates which include spicy Italian meatballs, crab bruscietta and sweet potato bhajis. The main plates were mighty fine too and maybe with a cocktail or two the next time. I am already looking forward to planning my next lunchtime visit to the Antrim Road’s famous stalwart. The Lansdowne is back with a bang – and so is quality food in North Belfast.The Lansdowne Hotel Antrim Rd, Belfast, BT EFTel:    www.thelansdownehotel"},{"url":null,"title":"by george late singer inspires co down artists winning work","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is the second year I had applied and there were over , applications, so to have been selected in the first place was amazing, and now to have been selected for a prize is even better.\"There were around , pieces of work in the exhibition, so its not an easy thing to get involved in,\" she said.\"Hopefully it will open a lot more doors for me in the future.\"Graces piece is made of gradients of blue glitter ribbon woven in three dferent directions to form a pattern that looks three-dimensional.She added: \"I had an idea of the piece I wanted to create, and while I was doing it I was listening to George Michaels music, and watching documentaries about his le and what he had to go through. I went with the flow. That inspired me and Im delighted with what I created in the end.\"Most of my work is inspired by my thoughts and emotions at the time of creating.\"I didnt start out to make it about George Michael, but listening to his music and watching documentaries about his le and the prejudice he faced developed it.\"It took around two months of intensive work to finish. It took on a le of its own, and considering the George Michael influence I felt, it was right to call it after him.\"It seems to have struck a chord with the Royal College of Art. Its a personal reflection of my thoughts and ideas at the time I was working on it and its great to have others who have been in the industry for years appreciate that.\"I like to play with the material, create D images which are attractive to the eye.\"With George Michael, I wanted to make something that was joyful and modern, and I feel that this award shows that it has translated.\"Graces work sold for £,.\"Its quite a rush to see the sold sign go up on something youve created,\" she said.\"Thats the recognition you want, but considering the cost of travelling back and forward to London several times, plus the entry fee for the exhibition, you dont make a lot of money from something like this. Its in the future, with that experience behind you, where you can hopefully build on the success.\"Gracing the halls at the Royal Academy of Art Summer Exhibition is seen as the holy grail for aspiring young artists since it began in .\"Its a long way from my days at Banbridge Academy. Id be walking around all messy with paint over my blazer. I was always the girl who did art.\"I just liked being creative and I think its important for young people to have an outlet for their emotions.

The businesses in Portglenone are delighted as its brought a lot more people into the town.\"It doesnt take that long to sow the seeds,\" said Damian, who works at the local DLF Seeds company and knows what it takes to bring the field to le. \"It was just a couple of hours of walking up and down shaking the fiddle, but after that its out of your hands as to whether everything comes good.\"This year Damien and Karen, with their three children Cara , Ryanand Therese , have crafted another masterpiece. Visitors are greeted by scenes reminiscent of a Monet impressionist painting with a touch of Van Gogh, all on the edge of Seamus Heaney country.\"We live in a very green country with lots of rolling meadows, but people seem to like a splash of colour too. Its dferent and we like to think its a very romantic setting,\" said Damien. \"We had three marriage proposals in the field last year, wedding parties coming for photographs, plenty of fashion photo shoots, buses stopping off on tours of the country and, of course, plenty of photographers. There were also a couple of music videos filmed.\"The families who have come along are getting back to nature. Its so good that people are getting out into the fresh air and appreciating natural beauty. Kids are running around the path spotting butterflies.\"Thats an added bonus this year, with a neighbour lending an extra acre-sized field where Damian has created the perfect haven for butterflies, and when work commitments allow, he is only too happy to take visitors on a guided walk through the wildflowers.\"Its worked so well,\" he said. \"Were getting plenty of guests! \"Weve seen some of the rarer types, like painted ladies and peacocks. Youd almost think they were looking at you as the patterns on the wings resemble eyes. Its lovely to see them coming into their natural habitat.\"Obviously were relying a lot on the weather, but its been warm enough so far this year to allow the sunflowers to come out. They are a tropical plant, so heavy rain can take its toll, but theyve survived so far andwe can manage to get a couple of decent sunny days, even more of them should come out. Were at around % right now, and they thrive on direct sunlight.\"Karen and her kids, plus an army of young people from the town, have all been roped in to keep the meadow in tip top shape, and she expects the field to be open to the public for the next few weeks.\"Obviously theres a limited time span for when the sunflowers are in bloom, soanyone does want to take a stroll through, forget all about everyday le and lose themselves in a natural world, the next two to three weeks will be the best time to experience it,\" she said.\"In the meantime, were only too happy to have people as our guests, bring a picnic or a flask of tea and enjoy it while it lasts.\"This year, Damien and Karen are raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. Entry is £ or £ for  to -year-olds. Under s go free.

The middle child of a family of five, he grew up in Glengormley with his parents John and Marie and siblings Christina, Paul, Neal and Fionnola.Conor says he was in his mid-teens when he felt the call to a le of ordained ministry. \"For as long as I can remember I have wanted to be a priest,\" he told the Belfast . \"Even as a child my siblings and neighbours were co-opted into one of my games of Mass so, clearly, from an early age the inclination to be a priest was there.\"The idea sort of grew up with me and then came to fruition when I was . \"There was no history of clergy in our family but we are all practising Catholics and very faithful people,\" Fr Conor added. \"There was also no great surprise when I told my family about wanting to become a priest - they have always been completely supportive.\"I never experienced any negativity amongst my friends either, who would be of dferent beliefs. \"One of my close friends, who is now married with children, even came with me on a vocations weekend, so people have always been helpful.\"Even though the image of the Church and the priesthood in particular has attracted negative press in the past, I have never let that deter me.\" A former pupil of Our Lady of Lourdes Primary School, and St Malachys College on Belfasts Antrim Road, Fr Conor studied history and philosophy at Queens University Belfast. As well as training at St Malachys Seminary, he read theology at the Pontical Irish College in Rome and was ordained in July  at St Bernards Church, Glengormley. A keen cyclist who has also been known to hit the dancefloor for charity contests, he says being Irelands youngest parish priest is simply \"a sign of the times\".\"There are challenges as in every walk of le, in particular continuing to connect with the people of our parishes and building up a sense of closeness to God. \"Its also about building up connections with those of other faiths in our communities as were all part of the same team,you like,\" he says. \"For me its a very rewarding and privileged position with great opportunities that Im very excited about. \"I certainly dont regret my decision. \"I know of young men, even in the parish where I was ordained, who have been willing to give the priesthood a go. \"It hasnt worked out for all of them but it shows that the well isnt completely dry,\" he adds. In his new role in Glenravel, Fr Conor will serve as the administrator of The Braid and provide chaplaincy services to schools in Ballymena and St Killians College in Carnlough.While he will miss \"the great parish community and real country feel\" in his current curacy in Carryduff, Fr Conor is relishing his new role. \"Im excited for the future and for what God will do in that particular place. \"Its a lot of responsibility and it will be a big change but I am looking forward to it.\"He added that while \"in some respects\" his new position has placed a lot of weight on his shoulders, he is trusting in Gods providence to take care of him.Fr Conors move to his new parish is part of the Down and Connor diocesan changes announced by Bishop Noel Treanor who was appealed for more men to consider the religious le given the continuing decline of clergy numbers throughout Ireland.\"Undoubtedly, the increasing age profile of clergy and declining numbers of available priests has created its own challenge in fulfilling the Churchs mission and ministry, a challenge which our clergy respond to on a daily basis with generosity and faith-filled dedication,\" the bishop said."},{"url":null,"title":"new car market declined by 4 1","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

After he trained as an architect and engineer, he was apprenticed to the Derry building firm of George and Robert A. Ferguson. He later set up his own practice in the city and at a young age was responsible for large projects in Omagh, Coleraine and other towns.Amongst the projects he oversaw in his native city were the Corporation waterworks at Creggan and was he was also associated to the layout of Foyle College grounds for building purposes. But amongst Barkers main projects was designing a shirt factory for David Hogg and Charles Mitchell at Sackville Street in Derry. He had also been heavily involved in the project to build the new Presbyterian |Church at Burt, Co Donegal in the mid-s.Constructed in , Hogg  Mitchell’s shirt factory almost immediately won a highly lucrative contract when it became the supplier of shirts for the British Army during the Boer War . The company founded the ‘Old England’ line of shirts which later became the globally known ‘Peter England’ brand. It continued to manufacture shirts in Derry until the s and the façade of Barker’s building still exists today as the building was converted into an apartment block in .Tragedy struck William Barker when in late  he fell off a horse and never recovered consciousness before his death at the young age of  on May , .He left a widow, Maryand three children-Mary Violet Barker, Thomas McCurdy Baker and William Alexander his namesake at his home at Orchard Street in the centre of the city.While William Snr undoubtedly left his professional mark even at such a young age on his native city, it was his son Thomas who lived a truly fascinating le having borne bearing personal witness and suffered as a result of one of the most decisively brutal acts of the Second World War.Thomas McCurdy Barker was born in , was a Presbyterian minister and a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. He was the first full-time secretary of the Irish Christian Movement, the convenor and organiser of the  conference ‘Ireland’s Hope’, the proceedings of which he edited, and from the s a missionary and professor of New Testament Greek at Mukden in the Chinese province of Manchuria.The Second Sino-Japanese War was fought between the Republic of China and The Empire of Japan between July  and September . China fought Japan with the aid of the Soviet Union and the USA, but after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in  the conflict became immersed in WWII and a result became the largest conflict in Asia during the twentieth century.The war between China and Japan was the result of a decades long Japanese imperialist policy to expand its influence both politically and militarily in order to secure access to raw materials, food and labour.Internecine warfare in China also provided strong opportunities for Japan who viewed Manchuria as almost limitless supply of raw materials, a market fot its manufactured goods and a protective buffer against the Soviet Union in Siberia.Japan invaded Manchuria in September  after what bacame known as the Mukden Incident. It was an event staged by Japanese military personnel as a pretext for a full invasion.On September , Lieutenant Suemori Kawamoto detonated a small quantity of dynamite close to a rail line owned by Japans South Manchuria Railyway near Mukden. The explosion was so weak that it failed to destroy the track, but it was enough to allow the Imperial Japanese Army to accuse Chinese dissident with causing it and as a result they invaded and occupied Manchuria, establishing a puppet state called Manchukuo after five months of incessant fighting. The Japanese even installed Chinas last Emperor, Puyi as the ruler to try and lend legitimacy to thwe situation.The invasion of the whole of China came six years later in July  when Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo Bridge-an access route to Bejing. As the conflict became merged into WWII, the Japanese began imprisoning people in concentration camps and amongst these was Rev Thomas McCurdy Barker who was incarcerated for the duration of the war at Nagasaki.On the day of the U.S nuclear strike on August ,  the population of Nagasaki was estimated to be ,. There were , Japanese residents, , Korean residents, , conscripted Korean workers, , Japanese soldiers,  conscripted Chinese workers and  Allied POWs.A Boeing B- Superfortress plane called Bockscar, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, took off just before dawn carrying a plutonium bomb code named Fat Man.The initial target was the city of Kokura, but it was obscured by cloud and smoke, so the Americans turned their attention to their secondary target-Nagasaki. But, it too was covered by cloud. Running short of fuel, the plane encircled the city several times and it was decided to use radar to drop the device. But, at the last moment the cloud cleared and the bomb was dropped on the citys Urakami Valley-midway between the Mitshubishi Steel and Arms plant in the south and the Mitsubhisi-Urakami Ordnace works in the north.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe plane had arrived over Nagasaki at .am and just under a minute after it was released it exploded at .am at an altitude of approximately , ft.

The attack came three days after the first nuclear bomb had been dropped on Hiroshoma, but the Nagasaki device was more powerful than the first bomb but because the city was surrounded by hilly terrain there was less damage.In , another Irish prisoner who also witnessed the bombing of Nagasaki. This was Dr Aidan MacCarthy, a medic in the RAF from County Cork who wrote: “Then there followed a blue flash, accompanied by a very bright magnesium-type flare which blinded them. Then came a frighteningly loud by rather flat explosion which was followed by a blast of hot air.“Some of this could be felt even by us as it came through the shelter openings, which were very rarely closed owing to poor ventilation.“We all genuinely thought, for some time, that this was the end of the world.”Amongst his fellow prisoners was a community of Catholic nuns to whom in the absence of a priest Rev McCurdy ministered to every day-an act which was later recognised when he received thanks from Pope Pius XII when he learned of the Derry mans actions after the war.Also there was Ann Barker, the Rev Thomas second we, who as a medical doctor also practised her profession during her imprisonment at Nagasaki. Her expertise is credited with helping her husband continue to live a rich le in his later retirement despite the effects that the bomb had on his physique.Lilian McCombe was a school teacher at the Presbyterian station at Mukden where she had lived and worked since .In  she wrote: “That chapter of my le closed with the attack by Japan on Pearl Harbour on December , . From that date, I with some  other colleagues were under Japanese jurisdiction. The greater part of the intervening years were spent in internment camps in the cities of Kobe and Nagasaki.“After a non-stop voyage of around three weeks via the Pacic Ocean, I was welcomed in the USA by my brother James, staying several days with the family there. The old Queen Elizabeth, then a troop ship brought me to Southampton, next day to be greeted by my family and later, by a host of friends!“Following a period of ing health, I was eventually led back into teaching until retirement age was reached.”The horrendous experience of imprisonment and a nuclear attack however did not appear to dissuade Rev Barker from giving up on his mission or other duties in Manchuria. Thomas, also it seems had the ear of the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong. And, despite the all encompasing rise of communism in China, he was allowed to continued teaching up until  when the leader of the Peoples Republic of China could no longer guarantee his safety-but Thomas Barker remained in contact with Mao Zedong up until shortly before his death.The cleric was -years-old when he ed to Ireland and was appointed as minister to the Presbyterian Church in Donegal town in  where he remained in service until .In recognition of his missionary service and his undoubted capabilities as a pastor the Church made him Moderator of the Presbyterian Church between - and his alma mater, Trinity College made awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree.

Her comments were backed by UUP leader Robin Swann.Yesterday, SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood MLA said there is a palpabale sense of anger across the city that has to be addressed and the Apprentice Boys bear a lot of the responsibility in addressing it.Fty years on from the Battle of the Bogside when the nationalist people of Derry stood up for their rights, Mr Eastwood was askedthe actions over the weekend showed there is real leadership and respect between both communities.He said: \"The way the DUP have handled the situation is disgraceful and they have avoided showing any kind of leadership. Some people in the DUP have deliberately rubbed salt in the wounds and its time for them to wise up.\"We have to move beyond this where were constantly poking people in the eye about issues that happened many years ago.\"We have to move forward together, the Apprentice Boys, the community, the business sector and politicians were part of the solution when it came to marching it Derry and they have to be again. But it has to be on the basis of respect for people who live in the city.\"People cant be disrespected, especially the feelings of the Bloody Sunday families, like they were last week.\"There has always been an understanding that the Apprentice Boys marches would be accommodated but that there would be respect shown to the local community. They should be about the events theyre commemorating not about peoples political causes in the march.\"That could start with ensuring that that band never takes part in a march in Derry again.\"The march will have to be accommodated in future, he said, \"however dficult that is for people in the city becausewe want to create a new Ireland we cant do it by denying people the opportunity to march.\"We done it in much more dficult times, so we have to do it again, but its a two way street andwe want to have a shared city respect has to be shown by everyone.\"He welcomed a statement from the Apprentice Boys acknowledging the hurt caused, saying, it demonstrates \"the kind of leadership that Derry and the North needs right now\".GoadingSinn Féin Vice-President Michelle ONeill has also called on the leadership of the main unionist parties to condemn the \"deliberate goading of victims\" which took place last weekend.Michelle O’Neill said: “The inclusion of Soldier F and British Army Paratrooper emblems have been seen in Derry as a deliberate attempt to goad and antagonise the Bloody Sunday families.“The decision of senior DUP representatives wearing Apprentice Boys regalia to pose for photographs under a Paratrooper regiment banner is seen in exactly the same light.“However, instead of confronting this mocking of victims, both main unionist parties have sought to deflect and criticise the policing operation instead.“Once again that is an abdication of leadership from the DUP and the UUP. Instead of defending disrespect and pandering to the lowest common denominator they should come out and clearly condemn this deliberate goading of victims.”Prominent figure during the Battle of the Bogside, People Before Profit Councillor Eamonn McCann said DUP politicians standing under a Parachute Regiment banner meant people could reasonably draw the conlcusion that they were \"supporting murder in the Bogside\".Meanwhile the Alliance Party said the DUPs criticism of the police response risks fuelling flase notions of two-tier policing.Alliance Policing Board member John Blair MLA said: \"Accountability is vital to policing but politicians need to be careful not to cross over to undermining policing. The DUP and UUP need to acknowledge this one band were wrong to parade with Parachute Regiment insignia in Derry-Londonderry, given the context and legacy of Bloody Sunday.“Such politically opportunistic actions are not helpful to policing across the community, particularly given other recent events.

He brushed aside two weak challenges in the YC box before firing past Carberry.Within less than a minute it was -.A superb run and cross from Rice was laid off by Neale to the onrushing Thomas Healy and he steered the ball into the corner of Walshrsquos net for his first goal for Killyleagh.Killyleagh were struggling to deal with Olympicrsquos pace in attack, with Molloy in particular causing problems and it took a fine save from Carberry in the th minute to keep out the wingerrsquos curling shot.From the resultant corner Olympicrsquos two big central defenders combined, with Paul Dickson outjumping Macaulay Foster to head back for Jason Noade to head in and make it -.The second half was only four minutes old when Olympic had strong penalty appeals waved away by the referee when McClean went down in the box under a challenge from McConnell.Two goals inside two minutes shortly after the hour mark seemed to have killed the game.Nathan Jones was having his best ever game at The Showgrounds with Killyleagh struggling to cope with his pace when he switched to the left wing in the second half.When he was left one on one with YC sweeper Niall Walsh in the st minute he put on the after burners and delivered a beauty of a finish past Carberry.Ballynahinchrsquos fourth goal, two minutes later, was stunning. A superb team goal passing across the fullof the pitch, orchestrated by Stephen Noade and involving Jones, ended in a YC defender putting into his own net.Killyleagh, though, refused to throw the towel in and when their stand-out player, Rice, yet again exposed a vulnerability on the flanks, his inch-perfect cross was bravely turned in by Neale in the th minute.This was the spark for Killyleaghrsquos best spell of the game with Rice giving width and McConnell the creator and Jamie Sharvin linking up play.Walsh somehow kept out with his feet Jamie Sharvinrsquos nd minute effort from Healyrsquos pass and then three minutes later he gratefully ped on Jamie Sharvinrsquos close range shot under pressure from another Rice cross.The big crowd was getting value for the entrance fee now and Walsh underlined his Amateur League representative reputation by producing a supering save from Ricersquos cross to cut out the danger in the th minute.Olympic were content to hit on the break by this stage and substitute Aaron McClean went close with a header before the visitors delivered the ultimate sucker punch.A stunning pass from deep allowed Jones to race through and Dalton Tate delivered the finish in the nd minute.But still the game wasnrsquot finished. Rice powered down the line yet again and once more producing a teasing cross which Neale thumped in.It was now -.

By working with the Downpatrick Property Trust, we are able to regenerate this building to provide a commercial interest and much needed guest accommodation in the heart of the town.Breenrsquos Corner is the third project to be undertaken by the trust.It previously developed and later sold Maghinis House in Irish Street and also developed Britches Close in English Street as commercial and office accommodation.The trust also invested pound, in the Breenrsquos Corner buildings when they were bought and refurbished as residential accommodation in .The last of the residential tenants vacated the building several months ago and it has remained unoccupied.Current commercial clients which occupy ground-floor shops are not included in the development.The trust, which is chaired by Fergus Kelly, was described treasurer Mal McGrady as ldquoa community developer of the last resort which gets engaged when there is no private interest in developing a building or the cost of renovation would make development prohibitive for any private investor.He said: ldquoWe are excited by the new concept that Stephen Magorrian and Denvirrsquos proposed to us.ldquoThis concept is a win-win both for Denvirrsquos as it gives extra accommodation while bringing back this property into use which is beneficial to the townrsquos tourism offering.Mr McGrady said that the project was important to Downpatrick town centrersquos continued development.ldquoAt present this buildingrsquos external facade is an eyesore, particularly for traffic entering the town centre.ldquoWe will have the facility to provide an extra  beds in the town centre which will help provide accommodation for people on golf tours, bike tours, casual visitors and bus tours who stop at the St Patrickrsquos Centre and Down Museum and we believe that this will help regenerate the town centre, he added.The development, which is designed by JNP Architects and is being carried out by Keelryan Developments Ltd, of Newcastle, intends to provide affordable, contemporary guest accommodation to appeal to tourists and visitors who wish to stay in the town.Mr Magorrian said the Horatio Group would be responsible for the interior fit-out of the rooms and suites which would be leased from DPT and marketed by Denvirrsquos on its website and other hospitality sites such as Air bnb.ldquoI want the guests to be totally surprised when they come into the accommodation as it will be totally dferent to the exterior, he remarked.ldquoGuests can either walk the few metres around the corner to breakfast at the inn or enjoy a breakfast hamper provided by Denvirrsquos made up with items from local suppliers..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17787135.bishop-clogher-leads-pilgrimage-lourdes/resources/images/10266619.jpg","title":"bandstand john garrity","story":"How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band How would you describe your sound Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Neils grandmother is in the centre of the centre row.He said: “A good friend of mine owned a bar in Dromore, she gave me an old bottle that said ‘ginger beer’ on it. It was meant as a joke because I’m ginger, but it ended up starting a fascination with bottles.“I started looking into where the bottles were made and background to them..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “My original intent was to collect a bottle from every county, but soon I found out there are a lot of bottles out there, probably  known bottles. They are very dficult to find. I would hunt through antique shops, flea markets, auctions and that type of thing. You also pick some up by word of mouth or even dig them up from an old dump site.“My collection ranges from Coleraine to Cork, but a number of local bottles have eluded me. I am aware of bottles from Lurgan, Portadown and Banbridge but am yet to locate these. In particular, the Crystal Mineral Water company in Banbridge produced some fantastic stoneware bottles and it would be the pinnacle of my collection to add one of these.” The bottle from the Crystal Mineral Company in Banbridge that Neil would love to add to his collectionExplaining the history of stoneware bottles, he said: “They were produced during the Victorian era, late s, early s, and were all hand made. No two bottles are the same due to the processes involved, but the minor flaws are what add to their charm. “Historically stone bottles were gradually replaced by mass produced glass bottles, the result of which is that many of these were buried in landfill sites or dumped in rivers and canals and can be dficult to locate.”Neil added: “I’ve always had a big interest in local social history, these stoneware bottles are part of it. I have been working hard in documenting the past so that it can be preserved for future generations. “I have amassed a collection of local items, everything from clocks to water pumps, but there are a few items that I have struggled to find. I am keen to locate any stoneware bottles from Banbridge and anything relating to the Dunbar McMaster spinning mill in Gilford.”He said: “I was born in Gilford into one of the mill workers houses owned by the Dunbar McMaster company and my family were historically mill workers there.

Without the pressures of work and the usual humdrum routine, suddenly there is time to bury your nose in an engrossing read. We asked three leading Ulster writers what they read this summer. By Helen McGurkThe Co Tyrone author has penned more than  short educational films, plays and musicals as well as nine novels, including the top  Kindle bestseller The Legacy of Lucy Harte .Claire Allan‘I had the pleasure of a week in the sun in late June, just after exams were done and dusted.When I was there I devoured three fantastic books by the pool - a luxury I definitely wouldn’t be able to do at home. First up was Daisy Jones and the Six by American author Taylor Jenkins Reid. I’d been looking forward to reading this after the synopsis caught my attention earlier in the year and it didn’t disappoint. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button ‘The Six’ are a fictional band of the s and the book tells in diary type entries from ious band members, media and crew, their story from how they were formed until their break-up after reaching the dizzy heights of fame. The star of the show is the enigmatic Daisy Jones . She joins the band on stage one night, barefoot and beautul, and everyone falls for her, including the reader.Lucy CaldwellIt’s a well paced, unique story that I was sad to finish and was left wishing that I could go and listen to Daisy’s dulcet tones for comfort after - maybe someone will record a soundtrack  I’m definitely a fan! Next of all was a change of pace with the wonderful A Thousand Roads Home by Wexford’s Carmel Harrington. Carmel writes so warmly and with great emotion, so I found this book very soothing and a perfect holiday read. It tackles the theme of homelessness with great sensitivity and I enjoyed getting to know Ruth, her son DJ and Dr O’Grady who are all faced with homelessness for very dferent reasons. The cast of A Thousand Roads Home are an endearing bunch, and once again, I was left thinking about them when I turned the last page. It was a very satisfactory read that definitely will warm the cockles of your heart! Lastly, I thoroughly enjoyed The Other Half of Augusta Hope by Joanna Glen which takes a clever look at le through the eyes of Augusta, who we meet first as a child, and how she doesn’t fit in with her family’s ordinary existence. Parallel to her story is that of young Parfait who escapes a le of trauma and torture in Burundi to live in Spain. The story weaves through both Augusta and Parfait’s journey into adulthood, their similarities and the stark contrast of their existence - while I more or less predicted some of the ending, I was left with tears in my eyes as each of them found their way in le. This is a very special and magical story and I immediately passed the book on to my sister when I got home. She loved it too.’Claire AllanThe international bestselling author from Londonderry wrote her first novel in , and Rainy Days and Tuesdays was subsequently published in  and reached number  in the Irish Bestsellers chart.PSNI going crackers trying to catch parrot in police station car park Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"‘My first recommendation is The Chain from Belfast writer Adrian McKinty which has been making waves around the world. The premise is first class – your child has been kidnapped and the only way to get them back safely is to kidnap another child…It’s fast-paced and breathtaking in places – and has quite rightly catapulted McKinty, a familiar figure to Northern Irish readers,into the public consciousness. A movie deal has already been signed.The most beautul book I’ve read this summer, and perhaps this year, is The Girl At the Window from English writer Rowan Coleman, who has become a must-read author for me. The book is set against the backdrop of Ponden Hall, where Emily Bronte penned most of Wuthering Heights, and it is an exquisitely written story of love, loss, hope and strength – with a ghostly twist or two.This summer I have also devoured the DS Maeve Kerrigan series of books by Irish author Jane Casey. The latest instalment, Cruel Acts, was released earlier this year but I highly recommend starting at the beginning of the seriesand reading them all in order. Casey has created a brilliant narrative, compelling characters and isn’t afraid to pull the rug out from under her readers’ feet. Just brilliant – and a further instalment is due in early .’Lucy Caldwell Born in Belfast, Lucy Caldwell is the multi–award winning author of three novels, several stage plays and radio dramas and, most recently, two collections of short stories: Multitudesand Intimacies .‘A perk of my job is reading books in manuscript before they’re published – and I’ve recently been lucky enough to read Inventoryand Where Are We Now  , forthcoming books by Darran Anderson and Glenn Patterson, respectively the former a searing memoir about growing up in poverty in Derry, the latter the writer’s latest, and I think best, novel to date –you liked Andrew Sean Greer’s Pulitzer Prize-winning Less, you’ll love this even more. You heard it here first – get them on next summer’s reading list!In the meantime, I loved Sweet Home , the debut collection of short stories by East Belfast writer Wendy Erskine, and I can’t wait for If All the World and Love were Young, the already-lauded debut poetry collection by Belfast poet Stephen Sexton, out later this month. One of my books of the year has been the strange, elliptical and haunting Territory of Light, recently reissued by Penguin Classics a slim novel in twelve parts by Yūko Tshushima, translated by Geraldine Harcourt.And for sheer sentence-by-sentence joy, you can’t do better than Kevin Barry’s Book Prize-longlisted Night Boat to Tangier .My comfort-read this summer has been a much-loved book of short stories that I go back to every couple of years, The Girl’s Guide to Hunting and Fishing by Melissa Banks , for which the old adage rings true - it was done a disservice by its cutesy, girly, pastel cover when it was first published.And I’ve just downloaded Adrian Tchaikovsky’s sci-fi epic Children of Time onto my Kindle for my wakeful hours with a teething toddler. I can’t yet vouch for it, but it comes highly recommended by trusted readers so far…’try catch  TrendingThese are all the mobile speed camera locations in Northern IrelandBody found in Nora Quoirin searchUpdated: Major NI road closed in both directions following RTC -

When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns hot-dogs Upcoming events in conjunction with Local Authorities are:Shambles Market, Armagh, on August Peoples Park, Ballymena, on August Carnfunnock Park, Larne, on August Celebrating business excellence at awards Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"MIDU | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"MIDU | Article Teaser\"Bangor on August , and,St Columb’s Park, Derry, on August .If you would like to attend one of the ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events, get in touch with Dogs Trust’s Campaigns team in Northern Ireland via email campaigns.ni@dogstrust.org.uk or by calling .try catch  TrendingMankilled in two vehicle road traffic collision -

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise. Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/qub_1.jpg","title":"ulster business top  sees sales rise by ","story":"Posted on Monday August  by Ulster Business Michael Neill, head of office, AL Goodbody Belfast, sponsor of the Top , Flavio Malnarcic, chief financial officer, Moy Park and Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest businesses have seen sales rise by .% to more £.bn, the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list  has revealed.The list, sponsored by AL Goodbody, showcases the successes of the biggest firms from right across Northern Ireland.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute. Let’s hope it’s the former.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flav_1.jpg","title":"top  moy park takes number one spot","story":"Posted on Thursday August  by Ulster Business From a purely editorial perspective it would be refreshing to have a dferent company head up the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list.But Moy Park has now made it to the top for eight consecutive years, as the poultry processing giant continues to expand both its workforce, global sales and pre-tax profit – firmly setting its place at Northern Ireland’s biggest business, with a workforce of more than , here alone.In the last year, it has grown turnover to just over £.bn, up from £.bn a year earlier, while pre-tax profits have surged by % – rising to £.m in its latest set of accounts, ending December .The business supplies Moy Park branded and own label chicken products to leading retailers and foodservice providers throughout the UK, Ireland and Europe.In numbers, Moy Park processes six million fresh chickens each week, , turkeys a year, along with , tonnes of other ‘added value products’.London-born Chris Kirke replaced long-serving boss Janet McCollum in , less than a year after Craigavon-based Moy Park was taken over by new US owners Pilgrim’s.And around a year ago, Flavio Malnarcicjoined the business – then as executive business director – before taking over as the firm’s chief financial officer.He was formerly business director at JBS Global, and has a senior leadership background as executive director of the poultry and export business in Seara, also as chief financial officer and chief executive at Tyson do Brazil and finance roles in Cargill.“There has been a consistence in the performance.

We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s.
