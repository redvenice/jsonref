Yes, it hasn\u0027t had a roof for over 300 years.\u0027Mr Jones said the restoration was excruciating to do, both physically and mentally. The first day was horrendous, trying to tackle the undergrowth and trees that had sprung up within and around the ruin.A huge maze of scaffolding needed to be erected, including over the top of the ruin, to at long last get the site watertight and ready for the biggest renovation Mr Jones has ever tackled.         Mr Jones had a life long fascination with the castle, pictured after being restored, but admitted he found the then ivy-covered building spooky when he was a child and used to play nearby         The listed building had been without a roof for 300 years and to restore The Old Castle Mr Jones used the block and tackle method to lift hundreds of tons of stone into the airHe said: \u0027All the stone dressings were found buried in the floor in pieces, so we dug those up and put them all back together like a massive jigsaw piece.\u0027Hundreds of tons of stone needed to be lifted in the air and we did it all with block and tackle which is the original lifting mechanism just the two of us, we did it all by hand.\u0027The legend of the huge hole in the wall dates back to a time when the site was pillaged and stripped of all its internal features by thieves using a horse and cart to carry the spoils away.         Mr Jones, pictured, said there had been \u0027highs and lows\u0027 during the demanding building project but added that: \u0027It\u0027s a gripe to sell it... I really don\u0027t want to sell it\u0027Mr Jones said: \u0027We found lots of the stone from the hole buried and put them all back in one of the walls. It was smashed out probably hundreds of years ago so people could come in and steal substantial things like all the sandstone windows and fireplaces.\u0027He said every aspect of the restoration was done by hand, with the roof causing the most difficulty.He explained: \u0027The beams weigh about one to two tonnes each and we had to lift them six-foot up into the air. It would have been easier to build it from new.\u0027But there was no chance of that ever happening, not just because the property is listed but also because of the special atmosphere the unique house and its remaining ruins exude.Mr Jones says: \u0027It\u0027s a lovely atmosphere here, most people can feel it, it\u0027s a special thing. It\u0027s church like and very peaceful however it\u0027s got a very welcoming atmosphere.\u0027And what is special and unique about it is that there\u0027s still this ruinous part attached to the home. I think to restore the remaining ruin would actually ruin it. It\u0027s what makes the house so romantic.\u0027The project was also personal for Mr Jones, who revealed he had always been fascinated by the building, known locally as Llantwit Castle, since he was spooked by an experience there when he was a child. He said: \u0027It all started when I was a kid. I used to play here and was absolutely scared to death of it. It was very, very creepy in those days because the ruin was totally covered in ivy.\u0027It was always very gloomy even on a summer\u0027s day and there was always an eerie presence here and I actually got chased by horses here once. I can still hear the hooves hitting the stones now when I\u0027m working here.\u0027 The house itself is one restored wing of the former mansion with interiors designed to be authentic to the age of the building.         The conservation builder spent 15 years trying to buy the scheduled ancient monument, pictured before the building works, from the Vale of Glamorgan council and then another five transforming it into a three-storey homeIt now has three storeys of rooms that ooze authentic medieval character but with modern amenities which are accessed through a huge metal studded front door.The kitchen diner houses a range in the fireplace, Belfast sink unit, storage cupboard and blue pennant flagstone floors and there is also a garden that is  totally private and walled.There is a substantial living room off the kitchen that has an abundance of ceiling beams, carved mullion windows with leaded inserts and a limestone fireplace complete with a mantle carving.On this floor there is also a cloakroom. Potential buyers will be pleased to note that the facilities in this room are totally modern and not based on the medieval design of a hole out to the garden below.Climb the hand-built oak staircase and past the whitewashed limestone walls and there are two bedrooms and a bathroom to discover on the first floor, with one having views of the Bristol Channel coast in the distance.           Mr Jones said the roof, pictured from one of the spacious bedrooms, was the most difficult part as the beams weigh about one to two tonnes each and had to be lifted six-foot up into the air         The huge front door hinges and studs were all forged using traditional blacksmith methods on site and the home also has a walled garden attached to itUp to the top floor and there is a large bedroom that has an incredible double height ceiling that contains a mezzanine level that could be a raised sleeping platform, a study space or a lounge. Whichever space the new owner deems to be the principal bedroom they will be living in a building that has a fascinating past, being built by the locally famous Van family of Marcross, and thanks to Mr Jones it now has a future.There were many times when Mr Jones almost gave up, but his love for the building was stronger than the challenges that confronted him.He says: \u0027When I took this on, a lot of people laughed and wished me great luck - which I needed - they sniggered and thought it was a stupid idea.\u0027During the project Mr Jones found many historic coins on the land, plus a massive key he assumes once opened the front door of this home.He said: \u0027We found an actual Henry VIII crown that was connected with the early building because it was embedded in the floor, which was a brilliant find.         The home has been completed using period techniques and boasts wooden floors, stairs and beams across the ceilings\u0027The Charles I half crown dates from about 1625 and was found here in the back garden and dates this castle spot-on because it was finished in 1597.\u0027The oldest coin Mr Jones has found is an Edward I penny which dates back to about 1300, which was found in the back field. Mr Jones believes there are ruins and artifacts within the field that pre-date the house and go some way to prove that the site has been a home for many, many centuries.As the restoration has progressed, so has the interest in what Mr Jones has been doing. He says people have stopped in their cars or on foot to view the project, stopping him for a chat to find out more.That might have cost him some time but the project has cost him far more in monetary terms. It\u0027s likely the final bill will run into hundreds of thousands of pounds, although Mr Jones reckons this would have been over a million pounds had he not done the work himself.         Mr Jones said the restoration was excruciating both physically and mental with the first task of tackling the undergrowth, pictured as it was being cut back, and trees around the ruin testing his limits          If Mr Jones hadn\u0027t done the work himself, he thinks the restoration costs could have been over one million pounds. Pictured is one of the homes rooms which boasts a fireplace and stone floorAdding in the years of back-breaking work to the money spent and Mr Jones has now reached a bitter-sweet moment putting the three-storey wing he has saved from eternal ruin on the market.He says: \u0027Being a very determined person you can see now what it looks like, but it\u0027s been five years of hell but enjoyable as well - it\u0027s had its lows and highs. It\u0027s a gripe to sell it, I am living here at the moment and I really don\u0027t want to sell it.\u0027 Mr Jones and the local population are not the only people who have been fascinated with the ancient building and its rebirth into a home.Mr Jones says: \u0027The TV programme Restoration Man starring George Clarke shot a pilot and they absolutely loved it and wanted to do it in the series but I couldn\u0027t give them the start, middle and end date.\u0027They needed it to be a six-month turnover but that was definitely impossible. They were interested because this home is totally unique. I believe it\u0027s the first scheduled monument in Wales to be restored and turned into a dwelling.\u0027One of the finishing touches that Mr Jones has added to the property to mark its incredible rebirth is a carved phoenix plaque embedded into the wall.The Old Castle is for sale for £1.25m with estate agent Brinsons \u0026amp Birt."},{"url":null,"title":"Pilot apologises passengers Schipol airport activating hijack alert","story":"Share this article \u0027Nothing has happened and all passengers are fine and waiting to fly soon.

One room invites visitors to play around with light, illuminating various angles of an object, a subject endlessly explored by Leonardo. Another room attempts to bring to life the modern conservation studio.The final room hosts the painting, which has been set in a model of the altarpiece that housed it, in 1508, in the chapel of the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception in the church of San Francesco Grande, Milan, Italy. That room has a seven minute audio-visual loop.Richard Slaney, managing director of 59 Productions, said visitors so far had been staying the course. “People have become mesmerised by the painting,” he said. “The idea of a show like this, with only one painting, is a big experiment but it’s nice to be able to part of that and see what people make of it.”The show is the National Gallery’s contribution to celebrations marking the 500th anniversary of Leonardo’s death.The main event is the huge Leonardo show at the Louvre, in Paris, running until 24 February next year, to which the National has lent its other Leonardo, the Burlington House Cartoon.

Or her contemporary, a nun who was the first woman to write a full-length prose work in English and hid her name in the text. A new history of women’s writing argues that there was a thriving female literature far earlier than previously believed, and that earlier histories have deliberately excluded or marginalised the contributions of early medieval women.The first English women’s writing is usually dated to the later middle ages, to the likes of the 12th-century courtly writer Marie de France and 14th-century visionaries Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe.Published next month, Diane Watt’s Women, Writing and Religion in England and Beyond, 650–1100 argues that women were at the heart of the emerging English literary tradition much earlier. Watt, a professor at the University of Surrey, lays out in the book how some anonymous texts from the period were probably created by women, and contends that men rewrote works originally produced by women.“There was a vibrant literary culture that women were involved in, in a whole range of ways, before the Norman conquest. There’s a big Latin tradition preceding that which isn’t considered, partly because it’s in Latin and partly because the picture hasn’t been put together,” said Watt. “People might notice isolated cases of women’s writing, but the evidence hasn’t been put together.”Her book brings a host of early female writers together, including Leoba, an English missionary and abbess of Tauberbischofsheim in Franconia who died in 782 and Hugeburc, an English nun who joined the Benedictine monastery of Heidenheim. Leoba’s one surviving letter features the earliest example of poetry by an Englishwoman (“Farewell, and may you live long and happily, making intercession for me,” runs Watt’s translation from the Latin), while Hugeburc wrote an account of the lives of the brothers St Willibald and St Winnebald. Hugeburc is seen as the first named English woman writer of a full-length narrative, with her authorship of the text only discovered in the 20th century, when her name was found to be encrypted in the manuscript. Unencrypted, the Latin reads: “Ego una Saxonica nomine Hugeburc ordinando hec scribebam,” or “I, a Saxon nun named Hugeburc, wrote this”.Watt also argues that an anonymous eighth-century Life of Gregory the Great could have been produced by one of the nuns in Whitby’s double monastery, not necessarily by a monk. “The emphasis on women within the text would seem to reflect the interests of women, which would seem to suggest female authorship,” she said.She also makes the case that monastic writers of the time “overwrote” accounts by women of their own histories. One example, she claims, is Bede, who did not name the authors of the local books he drew upon for his account of the early abbesses of the English church in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People.It wasn’t only medieval monks overlooking the work of women. Watt writes that that even recently published studies of literary history continue to give short shrift to women, especially in relation to the pre-modern period. Watt believes that understanding women writers’ contribution is vital to understanding the period itself. “Our understanding of the period as a whole is diminished by not acknowledging their contributions,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61e9ab418defc745e99077b5ddda9eb9a2901ad1/101_0_1493_896/master/1493.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d21558abba76fb24520eaefa45dac660","title":"m and s marks and spencer launches christmas ad campaign all dancing advert","story":"Retailer throws down gauntlet to John Lewis with ‘shoulder roll’ move it hopes will go viralMarks \u0026amp Spencer has thrown down the gauntlet to John Lewis this year with an all-dancing Christmas advert featuring a signature “shoulder roll” move that it hopes could set dancefloors and social media alight over the festive season.Set to House of Pain’s 1992 hit Jump Around, the ad was made by the British director Jake Nava, best known for Beyoncé’s Single Ladies music video. The M\u0026ampS ad, which launched on Friday, features a cast of dancers “jumping around” in M\u0026ampS jumpers.The choreography in the M\u0026ampS’s “Go Jumpers” commercial is less complex than the routine tackled by Beyoncé and her backing troupe in Nava’s video, with the retailer offering advice on how to master the simple move (instructions: “adopt a power stance” and then roll your shoulder forward and back – and repeat). The store chain is hoping shoulder-rollers will then film their efforts and share their videos on social media using the hashtag #gojumpers.Nathan Ansell, M\u0026ampS’s director of marketing for clothing and home, said the infectiousness of the shoulder roll move had been picked up in focus groups. This week M\u0026ampS reported a drop in first-half profits after a sharp decline in clothing sales and the retailer hopes the feel-good ad will pull in shoppers. Its chief executive, Steve Rowe, has said a new design team will shed M\u0026ampS’s reputation for “frumpiness”. The M\u0026ampS ad, which unlike last year does not feature its TV presenter fashion muse Holly Willoughby, is designed to throw the spotlight on its knitwear as strong sales of woolies could be key to its financial success this Christmas. M\u0026ampS has said it expects to shift 6m jumpers and is trying to attract more young families to its stores. The ad features 50 jumpers costing anywhere between £20 and £150 – plus a £19.50 patterned jumper for dogs.The festive ad heralds the start of the annual battle for hearts and minds in what is known as the “golden quarter” for retailers, when stores make the vast majority of their profits. Shoppers are expected to spend £80bn in the final six weeks of the season alone, according to a report by the Centre for Retail Research.The M\u0026ampS ad is part of a record £6.8bn festive advertising spree this year as companies try to tempt people to spend after a tumultuous year in which some big names – most recently Mothercare – have gone to the wall.John Lewis’s festive advert has become an annual event thanks to its catalogue of emotional ads that have included Monty the penguin and the tale of a lonely man on the moon. Ikea also entered the fray for the first time on Friday with an irreverent ad set to an original grime track voiced by MC D Double E. Some of the retail industry’s biggest names, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and John Lewis, will wait until after Remembrance Day on 11 November for their big reveals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0922232a34514d664e84d2613bbd4eb13255c35/0_0_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7efd5ff542dd8a8457fc3fb18d085ac","title":"from bars to pod homes how underused car parks are being transformed","story":"Shopper numbers in city centres are falling, leaving car parks empty – and councils are finding innovative ways to repurpose the spaceThe Abbey Walk multistorey car park in Grimsby is a stark concrete layer cake with abstract reliefs sculpted by artist Harold Gosney on its flank and an elegant spiral access ramp. But despite its appearance, North East Lincolnshire council believe that Abbey Walk’s reputation for attracting anti-social behaviour puts off customers and is seeking £1.54m investment for a refurbishment programme. When I visited on a Saturday, there were surprisingly few vehicles inside. A group of young teenagers chased each other through the levels, hopping on the lifts, screams of mock fear echoing off the concrete. It felt like I was in an adventure playground as much as a car park, a space where imaginations could run wild.As shopper numbers fall in city centres as more of us shop online or visit out-of-town retail parks, many multistoreys like Abbey Walk are underused. A new idea is taking hold: doing something productive with them.Repurposing carparks is becoming a more popular idea in an era where pubs are closing, high streets are struggling and spending cuts have decreased the availability of public spaces like libraries, community centres and sports fields. In Peckham, a former multistorey car park was saved from demolition and repurposed in 2007, when Southwark council leased the top floor to the organisation Bold Tendencies, who opened a rooftop bar called Frank’s Café. The top three floors played host to exhibitions and cultural events, including a performance of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring by the Multi-Story Orchestra. In 2015 the council developed the middle floors and offered them up for lease. Bold Tendencies wanted to create 800 subsidised office spaces for creatives, but lost out in their bid to Make Shift, the developers behind Pop Brixton. In 2017 they opened Peckham Levels, a mix of bars, recreation spaces and studios for small businesses and social enterprises. The aim is to offer favourable rates for businesses in the local postcode, as well as donating a percentage of the profits to a community fund. Well-meaning though this might be, local community group Peckham Vision complained that the locals were not involved in drafting the brief for the bids. With food and drink prices inside the centre more expensive than on Peckham’s high streets, you might wonder if the Levels will become the socially erse community hub it promised to be. Neither does the building function a car park any longer. I had to park in the nearby Morrisons to pay a visit.Instead of turning car parks into something else entirely, they can be combined with other uses. For instance, in Harlow’s Terminus Street multistorey, there is a Mecca Bingo, while in Plymouth there are plans to develop the Harbour Car Park, adding a café and “living walls” made of plants. Over in the US, this trend is even more established. For instance, in Los Angeles a forthcoming residential complex created by AvalonBay Communities will include a multistorey with a gym, theatre, and restaurant space. In Florida’s Miami Beach, the 111 Lincoln Road multistorey is constructed from open-air platforms, with parking for 300 cars as well as shops on the ground level and a fashion boutique on the fifth floor. To capitalise on Florida’s many other parking spaces, a company called ParkJockey is planning to sell lots to taxi, car rental and food delivery companies. In Vancouver, The Gastown Parkades, have not only parking space, but offices, with retail at ground level and a room used by a film school. Meanwhile in Lisbon, the Park Bar is a trendy urban rooftop garden and cocktail bar on the sixth floor of a multi-storey.There is a growing argument that even superstore car parks could include entertainment and leisure facilities. In 2014 the Royal Society of Arts recommended that retail car parks should also be used for pursuits like basketball, skateboarding and tennis. They could host temporary skating rinks, climbing walls and fun fair rides or even shipping containers in which workshops and courses could be held. Profits from these activities might be be re-invested into local projects.There are signs of this happening. The owners of Coventry’s Cannon Park Shopping Centre plan to develop a section of the car park into student accommodation. In April it was announced that housing association Catalyst would build 450 affordable homes around three Transport for London car parks in Harrow. In August, a planning inspector gave the go-ahead for student accommodation to be developed in the car park of Sentinel House, a former office block. Meanwhile, South Somerset district council have caused some local shoppers consternation with their plans to develop the Box Factory, South Street, Court Ash and South Street Market car parks into housing. The danger with such schemes is that they remove a functional space that is needed by the wider community. An alternative is to integrate car parks and housing. For example, on 1 October Bristol City council approved spending for ZEDpods to build eleven homes over the St George carpark. These affordable, eco-friendly modular pods are raised on stilts above the car park, allowing for parking to continue beneath.However, in central London, the Welbeck Street multistorey, a diamond-patterned brutalist structure in the centre of London, originally built for a department store, became obsolete as heavy traffic and congestion charges reduced the number of shoppers using cars. A campaign spearheaded by the Twentieth Century Society tried to save the building for its architectural qualities, but in February this year Westminster council approved plans to demolish it and replace it with a hotel. Jo Underhill, a photographer who documented Welbeck Street’s final two and half years in her project Ode to Welbeck said: “It would have been great to see it repurposed rather than completely demolished”, adding, “not only was it aesthetically interesting but historically important, and an important part of the community.”Gareth E.

I see every election as a new dawn, an exercise not in bias confirmation but in self-discovery. What will it reveal of my outlook on life? Usually I follow my hero, the American HL Mencken, who advised voters to “always chuck the rapscallions out”, but I still want some excitement in the air. Above all, what would I like to see change?Labour should be a party of change. It is a party of the left, rooted in radicalism, a party of disruption not of reassurance. In London this week I listened to the charismatic Greek star, Yanis Varoufakis, as he stirred an audience of leftwing radicals, militants and rebels to revolutionary fervour. Come on, Yanis, they cried, stand against Boris Johnson in Uxbridge. I have been waiting years for an exciting Labour party. I want one of those rare democratic “moments” when cynicism abates, the sky brightens and reveals Browning’s “glad confident morning”. It happened when the Berlin Wall fell, on Barack Obama’s election night, even during Tony Blair’s brief Cool Britannia. In truth, Britain’s radical moment came with Harold Wilson’s forgotten government of 1964. It abolished hanging, legalised homosexuality, ended school selection, banned race discrimination, outlawed unequal pay, permitted abortion and liberalised orce – all in six years. The record was stunning. The Augean stables of British social policy were cleansed.This week’s arguments over macroeconomic policy are boringly familiar. Austerity has merely legitimised economic populism. We are back to the 2000s and Tony Blair’s let-rip of borrow-and-spend. Plans from both the chancellor, Sajid Javid, and his opponent, John McDonnell, return us to the cycle of stop-go. The last go slammed up against a brick wall in 2008.McDonnell has tried valiantly to take Labour economic policy in a new direction, but going back to co-operatives, social enterprise and worker-directors is hardly radical. Jeremy Corbyn is positively nostalgic, a reversion to the late-1940s, to tax-the-rich and the nationalisation of public utilities. On the last, he forgets Thatcher’s maxim, that you “more easily control utilities when they are in the private not the public sector”. As for the proposed state funds for new industries in the north, we have been there before and nothing happened. Of serious fiscal redistribution we have nothing as yet.It is not the British economy that needs cleansing, it is the same old Augean stables of social policy. Why is any thought of drug law reform left to backbench MPs, the police and London’s mayor? British prisons are absolute shockers, among the worst in Europe. All Labour says is that it will hire more police. Obesity blights the nation’s young and again rates are among the highest in Europe. Where are the pledges to regulate the food industry?Today’s school budgets buckle under a regime of Whitehall targetry, inspection and box-ticking. They are fragmented into regulated academies, which has corrupted and cut them off from their local communities. Housing policy is now in thrall to the construction lobby, and its rage for rural sprawl. It is the urban poor who need housing, although for them salvation lies not in subsidised “starter” estates but in a radical new deal for private renting. As for the NHS and the courts, they are straitjacketed by professional splits and demarcations. Yet no one has the courage to tackle the vested interests, the doctors and the lawyers.These areas of social policy are ones in which Britain used to lead Europe, if not the world. It does so no more. Rented housing is better regulated in Germany, health in Sweden and Denmark, prisons in Norway, drugs in America and Canada. Corbyn does not even have to be radical, just imitate the best and liberate local government to experiment. The issues are not primarily about money or even left or right ideology, they are about having the guts to reform the law and confront the relentless dominance of London.Before becoming leader, Corbyn espoused the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He favoured foreign regimes and movements, some of particular odiousness. That was his business. But he had a healthy scepticism towards the interventionist fervour of Blair and David Cameron, which had soldiers serving, and dying, in countries of no conceivable value to Britain’s defence. Here at last, I thought, was a politician who might break ranks.Corbyn has claimed he will never use nuclear weapons. So why does he not promise to dispose of them? He has no plans to mothball or sell off Britain’s useless Trident submarines and aircraft carriers. When he arrived on the scene, I expected a clear statement that Britain should never again try aimlessly to “punch above our weight” in every unfortunate corner of the globe. Instead, I get more outspoken anti-interventionism from Donald Trump than I do from the Labour party.The nation is sated on political cynicism. It needs and deserves a break, a shot of radical optimism. That shot properly comes from an opposition party, with a licence to think the unthinkable and win a mandate for it from the voters. The party manifestos will be works of tedium, cliche and worthiness. We must pray for a few explosions of daring reform, something to make us punch the air and cry, “Bring it on!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/711d383e4ea0b00f27f8eec1a9c9668f4efd34fb/0_80_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4593c7434a4a6f2b0c548bbd8f25f158","title":"single people electoral force us uk","story":"Lately my friends and I have started joking that a commune is the answer. A big old rambling house in the south of France, maybe, with plenty of interesting people to talk to and a cellar full of booze.It’s not quite clear how we will manage the cellar steps, though, given this imaginary commune is for the hopefully distant day when we are old and frail but still desperate to avoid a nursing home. It’s only a daydream really, but for the singletons in our group it perhaps has a more serious side. When you’re young you worry about finding someone to love, but as time goes on the fear is more about who will look after you.All this is obviously a long way off for the actor Emma Watson, who explained to Vogue this week how, at 29, she has learned to be relaxed about being single, or “self-partnered” as she prefers to call it, and approaching 30. She sees herself not as lacking something but fine as she is, making her a part of a growing single positive movement which preaches the joys of learning how to be on your own but not lonely. When the Sunday Times columnist and author Dolly Alderton gave up dating for a year, she wrote that she’d missed “GCSE physics coursework, waiting for a night bus in the rain, the BCG vaccination” more than the soul-destroying business of trying to meet someone it was so much nicer just not to bother.In her book All the Single Ladies, analysing the rise of single women as an electoral force in America, the writer Rebecca Traister argues that the trend away from coupledom is pulling politics inexorably to the left. The darker side of independent living is knowing there’s nobody to bail you out of financial trouble, so policies like a higher minimum wage or stronger employment rights start to matter more. (One reason conservatives worldwide tend to champion marriage may be that, without it, people become markedly less keen on a small state, favouring an interventionist one instead.)Single women helped put Barack Obama in the White House and, while they didn’t stop Donald Trump, they helped drive interest in Bernie Sanders now politicians such as Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may be filling a similar gap. British pollsters rarely ask respondents’ relationship status, but it would be fascinating to see how much of Jeremy Corbyn’s support in 2017 came from singletons craving economic security.When I was Watson’s age I could still just about stretch to buying a tiny flat on my own in north London. But those dizzy days are long gone now. The median English home now costs eight times the salary of a single man on median male earnings, according to the Women’s Budget Group, and 12 times the salary of a single woman on median female earnings. More shockingly, it calculates that for a lone woman on median female earnings, no region in England is affordable to rent in the private market.Middle-aged orcees are falling back into student-style house-shares, and inevitably single parents have it toughest. Any singleton manifesto would put curbing house prices, stabilising rents and building more social housing at the top, but it wouldn’t stop there.It might well overhaul universal credit, which has been noticeably harsh on single parents (one in five food bank users are single parents, according to a study published this week by the Trussell Trust) it could also crack down on non-payment of alimony. A government for singletons would also prioritise social care, recognising that talk of more families looking after their own relatives is frankly scary for anyone ageing without children.It would crack down on gender or ethnicity pay gaps that make it unnecessarily hard for some lone earners to manage, and promote the flexible jobs that single parents often need. It would push car-sharing clubs, so that each household in a city street full of singletons doesn’t feel it needs its own car. The manifesto might even come up with a more realistic version of our French commune fantasy, via co-housing developments offering a mix of shared facilities and private space for micro-households.Look at that list, and it’s obvious Labour is already moving broadly in this direction. But it’s not the only party eyeing up this territory, and the fact that Corbyn is still lagging behind the Conservatives in the polls suggests the contest for singleton votes remains open.Nobody wants to be the voice of doom, pointing out that being happily self-partnered is a lot harder for anyone not earning Emma Watson’s salary. Millennials are right to run a mile from toxic relationships that make them miserable, and to hold out for the real thing they also deserve the same chances that my generation had to live and travel alone, and thus to learn the intoxicating lesson that we could cope if we had to.But in retrospect that freedom was the result, however unintentional, of benign economic and political forces that we didn’t even notice until they were gone, and it won’t just fall back into our laps by accident. All the single ladies, as the song goes, now put your hands up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cb2970ffd147ec811c9a0162ba5060464a51d96/0_354_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=246df67a46cc40eee1c8a835764ed317","title":"africa poised lead way global green revolution says report","story":"Continent is set for massive urbanisation but can avoid relying on fossil fuels, says IEAAfrica is poised to lead the world’s cleanest economic revolution by using renewable energy sources to power a massive spread of urbanisation, says an IEA report.The IEA, or International Energy Agency, predicts that solar energy will play a big role in supporting the continent’s growing population and industrialisation over the next 20 years.Africa has less than half the solar power installations seen in the UK, despite the sunnier conditions, but the IEA is predicting a solar boom in countries across the continent, which could give hundreds of millions of homes electricity for the first time.The report forecasts that Africa’s appetite for energy will grow at double the rate of the global average in the coming decades as the continent overtakes China and India as the most populated region in the world.Africa’s population is expected to grow to more than 2 billion people by 2040, a rise of 800 million from today or the population equivalent of the US and Europe combined, says the report. People are expected to turn to cities and towns at a rate never seen before, where the demand for new houses and infrastructure will ignite an energy-hungry industrial revolution.Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said Africa had a “unique opportunity” to leapfrog the fossil fuel dependency of other industrialised regions and host the first economic transformation that did not contribute to the climate crisis.“I am optimistic about Africa’s energy future – it will surprise pessimists,” Birol said. “I have great expectations for the energy industry in the years to come, both in terms of bringing energy access to Africa’s people but also driving economic growth.”He urged Africa’s leaders to take advantage of the natural resources available through solar power generation, and the mining of raw minerals needed to make electric and hydrogen batteries, which are in high demand across the world.He said some fossil fuels, such as natural gas, would be needed to support Africa’s heavy industries as they built the towns and cities needed to house the continent’s growing population. But the increase would be insignificant in the wider global climate effort, according to the IEA.“But while Africa does not contribute to climate change the continent is on the frontline of its potential effects, including droughts. Africa is perhaps the most innocent continent in terms of its contributions to climate change, but they will be the victims.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c360b6db88dd12f0f8eafa47bba9c28f98bf0c38/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=393fa324178e44eddef16bb0d0466dbf","title":"the guardians climate pledge 2019","story":"We want the  to play a leading role in reporting on the environmental catastrophe.

As it was, they scored two first-half goals for the first time in almost a year, kept the crowd entertained with some lively attacking football and back at the top of their group can now afford to be more relaxed about the games that remain against Astana and Alkmaar.“I was very happy with the way our three strikers played,” Solskjær said. “All the goals were high class and we could have had a few more. That is exactly how we want to play, even if Partizan gave us a bit more space than we are used to in the Premier League. We wanted to qualify as early as possible. We didn’t fancy making that long journey to Kazakhstan worrying that we had to get a win.”United should have scored even earlier than they did but when an Aaron Wan-Bissaka cross came through to Rashford at the far post he put his shot wide from the edge of the six-yard area with the whole goal at which to aim. When Rashford had another excellent opportunity a couple of minutes later, after Juan Mata’s cutback set up a shot from close range, he found Vladimir Stojkovic alert to the danger, the goalkeeper leaving his line early to smother the effort.Rashford has just reached his half century of goals for United at the precocious age of 22, and on another day he might have had three more inside the first 15 minutes. His third opportunity came courtesy of another searching cross from Wan-Bissaka, one that again found him in space in the Partizan area but demanded a volley. Rashford lined up his target and took his time but still ended up blazing over the bar with the most difficult of his three chances.Undeterred, Rashford could at least claim a large share of the credit for United’s opening goal midway through the first half. It was his incisive pass that split the defence and found Greenwood in an onside position, and the teenager neatly tricked what remained of the cover to open up a shooting angle before supplying a confident finish for his second goal in three games.That was the start Solskjær had been looking for and United obliged by scoring a quick second, the first time they have managed more than a single goal at home since the 4-0 victory against Chelsea on the opening day of the season. It was a notable inidual strike by Martial, whose penalty had settled the away fixture in Belgrade.Seizing on a half-clearance much more quickly than the ball-watching Strahinja Pavlovic, Martial burst into the area and gracefully held off two more defensive challenges before neatly poking the ball beyond Stojkovic at the last moment. It was a moment of instinctive opportunism and Martial would have been rewarded with a second goal immediately afterwards but for chipping over the bar when all the hard work seemed to have been done.Partizan did not change their shape or their attitude on going behind – they still kept plenty of men behind the ball though, even faced with a packed defence, United kept creating chances. They could have been further ahead by the interval but Rashford saw another shot saved and Ashley Young fired narrowly over after bursting into the area from the left.Fred opened the second half by giving Partizan a chance to get back into the game when he rejected a number of passing options in favour of giving the ball away to Umar Sadiq in the middle of the United half, though what could have been a huge embarrassment was calmly defused by Harry Maguire.United responded by going further in front through another fine goal, Young expertly laying off Mata’s diagonal cross for Rashford to score with a rising first-time shot.Rashford was withdrawn not too long after that, along with the influential midfield duo of Scott McTominay and Fred, as Solskjær looked to conserve energy and resources for the league game against Brighton on Sunday.For the same reason the team who take the field in Kazakhstan later this month are likely to be extremely fresh-faced and inexperienced, though on this evidence United can rely on their youngsters to acquit themselves well in Astana."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c536cf64263eb1472b4ee2ca80c51062185b0b30/0_205_1728_1037/master/1728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5740cae83b9a3dc51d8c7f02b5ff0aaa","title":"uefa gareth southgate racism football","story":"• England manager wants sanctions to get ‘higher and higher’• Southgate praises players for following protocol in BulgariaGareth Southgate has urged Uefa to keep increasing sanctions against countries guilty of racism but admitted he was not sure whether expelling Bulgaria from Euro 2020 would have had the desired effect of eradicating discrimination from the game.The Bulgarian Football Union was ordered to stage its next home match, against the Czech Republic, behind closed doors and fined €75,000 after the incidents during England’s qualifier last month that left play halted twice because of racism from home supporters during the first half.“There’s no question that we look at Bulgaria and think everything there was wrong. There were clearly people in the ground that have no place – as far as we’re concerned, as football people – in football.“But those people exist in our stadiums as well and we’re maybe better equipped at stopping them coming into the stadiums and that’s something that, in some countries, they’re going to have to get better at. “We’ve got to continue the sanctions. I think the sanctions are going to have to get higher and higher, but I couldn’t honestly tell you what the right answer for that would be.”England’s players decided against walking off in Sofia in order to comply with Uefa’s anti-racism protocols, and Southgate again commended the way they handled such an unpleasant experience. But, after Brescia’s Mario Balotelli threatened to leave the pitch after being targeted with racist abuse by Verona fans in Serie A last weekend, England’s manager said that Uefa must be prepared for more players to take similar action.“I think what is important is that we highlighted the process, which other clubs that have gone into Europe in the last couple of weeks I think are now more conscious of, because I think for everybody it wasn’t so clear for all that night,” Southgate said. “There is going to be a point actually where that will have to be reviewed because we went to a point and I think if that happens a few times, people are going to say: ‘Well, hang on a minute! What’s the …?’“It’s far from ideal for everybody. We should be trying to affect as much as we can it happening at all.

Perhaps this will be the season they win the one prize that has eluded them during their massively expensive modern overhaul. But as Pep Guardiola prepares for a meeting with the only English club that has come even close to rivalling the recent domestic achievements of his City side, he must be aware his repeated failures in Europe are starting to significantly dent his reputation. If he is going to turn this situation around, maybe this has to be the time.Guardiola has guided City to the league title in each of the past two seasons, winning an astonishing 198 points along the way, plus three domestic cups and a couple of Community Shields. In Spain, Germany and England he has won the league in eight of the past 11 years. It is an incredible record, one that puts him in the very top category of management. But before a manager can be defined as great, what must they achieve?If greatness is defined by how many times a manager wins the greatest prize in the sport – the Champions League – I don’t think Guardiola qualifies. If it is defined by what you achieve with limited resources, Guardiola has never been tested. If it is defined by the ability to transform the fortunes of the clubs they manage, then Guardiola – who took over Barcelona when they had won the league in two of the previous four seasons, Bayern Munich when they were reigning champions, and Manchester City when they had been champions in two of the five previous seasons and had unrivalled spending power – is unproven. He can coax the already great to new levels of achievement, but is that enough?Jürgen Klopp has a fraction of Guardiola’s medal collection but he took second ision Mainz into Europe for the first time in their history, took over a Borussia Dortmund side who had finished 13th in the Bundesliga and led them to consecutive league titles and a Champions League final, and has transformed Liverpool into a machine that won 97 points last season, stands six points clear as they prepare to welcome City to Anfield on Sunday, reached successive Champions League finals and won the more recent. He has won two league titles, both with the same club, but in many ways his record is the more complete and more impressive. And it is his success in Europe that really sets him apart.Perhaps it is unfair to hold Guardiola’s lack of European achievement against him. After all, City were knocked out of last season’s Champions League by Tottenham in the quarter-finals after VAR disallowed Raheem Sterling’s stoppage‑time goal for a marginal offside and allowed a Fernando Llorente strike that might have been chalked off for handball. If a couple of calls had gone the other way, refereeing decisions that Guardiola could have no control over, it could have been their year but instead they were out on away goals. But it was not a one-off: it was the third time in four seasons Guardiola sides had been eliminated on away goals. In Europe’s premier competition the Spaniard’s teams have repeatedly failed to come through close games. As Liverpool showed against Barcelona and Tottenham against Ajax in last season’s semi-finals the best teams find a way to win and City could not do that.Guardiola has never got to a European final without Lionel Messi, whereas Klopp has won one with Divock Origi. Guardiola’s Barcelona side won the treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League in 2008-09, something no other manager had done, but Luis Enrique repeated the feat in 2014-15 and nobody has him down as one of the all-time greats. José Mourinho won the Champions League with Porto and Internazionale and eight league titles in four countries, yet he seems to be disregarded as an old‑school manager with outdated ideas.Guardiola’s achievements put him in the highest level of European management but though his Barcelona team probably have to be counted among the greatest in the sport’s history in my opinion the title of genius has been given to him too quickly, particularly when there is another manager in the same league at the same time who has perhaps overtaken him in terms of his effect on his club and his achievements with them.Some people seem to think Klopp is first and foremost a motivator, whose teams are reliant on energy, power and pace, where Guardiola is a tactician. I think this is a completely unfair way of characterising what the German has created at Anfield. A lot of money has been spent in the transfer market but in a strategic and deliberate way, forming a front three who rival any attack in world football, bringing in probably the best defender on the planet in Virgil van Dijk and at the same time promoting young talent and making the most of undervalued players from other English clubs such as Andy Robertson and James Milner.He is also extremely consistent in tactics and team selection, where Guardiola is sometimes guilty of overthinking, both tactically and in the transfer market, signing incredibly expensive substitute full-backs and tweaking his formations, particularly in big games.Given Guardiola’s success as a manager, it seems bizarre to say he is under any pressure except whatever he chooses to place on himself. It is ridiculous even to consider the possibility of him getting sacked but he will not be at City for ever and whether he chooses to leave or is eventually told to go, what are the time limits and what does he need to achieve before he departs? At what point does that pressure really start to build? And if City were to once again be edged outin the quarter-finals this season, where would that leave him?City will be desperate to win at Anfield but the victory Guardiola truly needs to cement his reputation cannot come until May, at the Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul, the venue for the Champions League final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f6545b12cb27933f17604706b95b3765473d3ea/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01c0f3645c5674bfe07aab4379aa80c1","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Liverpool’s resilience faces biggest test, Vardy threatens to deepen Arsenal’s gloom and a welcome dilemma for NewcastleApparently there is a game going on in Liverpool on Sunday. Liverpool’s 2-1 win over Genk in midweek was very much a continuation of a theme – since mid-September they have also beaten Chelsea, Leicester, Tottenham and Aston Villa by the same scoreline, and they last won a league game by more than one goal at home to Newcastle on 14 September. In their last six league games they have a goal difference of only five, yet they have somehow converted that into a mathematically maximal 16 points. The day Liverpool beat Newcastle was also when Manchester City lost at Norwich, but since then the champions have thumped Watford 8-0, put three past Everton and Aston Villa and with the damaging exception of last month’s home defeat to Wolves looked gloriously untroubled. In their own past six games City have accumulated a goal difference of 14, but won only 15 points. Liverpool have often looked of late like a side desperate to lose but somehow unable to, and another demonstration of that kind of resilience on Sunday would give them a very significant advantage in the title chase. SB• Liverpool v Manchester City (4.30pm, all times GMT, Sunday)So far this season Watford have been winless and fairly hopeless, with Quique Sánchez Flores’s arrival making them much harder to score against, but also much less likely to score. But it’s not just their players’ form that has fallen apart, it is their actual physical bodies: their best striker, Troy Deeney, has not played since August their record signing, Ismaïla Sarr, has started one league game Danny Welbeck has a serious hamstring injury and they have been forced into a first-half substitution in each of their past four games. Perhaps this is one slump from which they can now start to emerge, with Deeney – who made his Watford debut in a televised Friday evening league game against Norwich – aiming to return to their squad for this game. Though both teams are in dismal goalscoring form, there has been only one goalless draw between them in 35 games at Carrow Road, with the last 10 encounters featuring a bumper 39 goals and six Norwich wins to Watford’s four. SBIt will be an experience that some never forget. Losing 9-0 at home will do that to you. Craig Forrest, the Ipswich goalkeeper who conceded nine to Manchester United in 1995, said only last week his own experience was still “crushing”. For the Southampton players that featured two weeks ago against Leicester, returning to that dressing room – the scene of the autopsy where they most likely contemplated their careers as well as defeat – will in itself be a mental hurdle to overcome. There will be similar emotions in the stands, as Southampton fans tentatively feel their way back to their seat. The truth is that in the two games since the Leicester drubbing – two unfortunately-timed league and cup visits to the Etihad – Saints have done themselves relatively proud, showing at least a bit of heart. That alone will not save them from relegation, but Moussa Djenepo might. The striker’s injury has meant he missed nearly two months of football (including Leicester) but the £14m summer signing looks a real handful if his wonderstrike against Sheffield United is anything to go by. How Southampton could do with some of that magic against Everton on their return home. MBA game between a team that doesn’t have Michy Batshuayi but could really use him, and one that does have Michy Batshuayi but doesn’t really use him: his six league appearances for Chelsea this season have lasted, on average, seven minutes and 40 seconds each (he has been credited with a total of 23 passes). The Belgian scored five goals in nine starts while on loan at Selhurst Park in the second half of last season, and having secured that deal, in Roy Hodgson’s words, by “putting a lot of money in Chelsea’s pocket” they are widely predicted to attempt to repeat the trick in January. “The lads are doing their best but we aren’t perhaps as blessed as some teams with a plethora of goalscorers,” Hodgson said this week of his current squad. “With the players we have to work with, I don’t think scoring lots of goals is necessarily something we are going to be able to boast that we’ve done too often.” SBThere is no club that Jamie Vardy enjoys playing more than Arsenal. In eight league starts against them he has scored eight goals, including three braces. When he was approached by the Gunners in the summer of 2016 and decided to remain at Leicester, he described the process of making up his mind as “just coming up with the positives and negatives” – and perhaps being unable, after signing for Arsenal, to play against them would have gone in the second column. He also said, explaining that decision, that “I’m a bit of a psychic – I could see the little downfall they are on now”. Perhaps Unai Emery could ask him when it might end, with many predicting that he might lose his job if Arsenal lose this fixture for a third successive season. SBWest Ham have not won a match since Lukasz Fabianski sustained an injury at Bournemouth in September, with many fans directing their ire towards his replacement, Roberto. The Spaniard, who was brought to the club in the summer by Mario Husillos, the under-fire director of football, was at fault for two of Newcastle’s goals last week, with his positioning for Federico Fernández’s looping header laughable, while he has also looked below par against Everton, Sheffield United and in a 4-0 defeat at Oxford United. With the promising youngster Nathan Trott unable to be recalled from AFC Wimbledon until January, and Fabianski also out until the new year, Manuel Pellegrini is stuck with Roberto or David Martin, son of the club legend Alvin, who signed from Millwall in the summer. With a tough trip to Burnley this weekend, Pellegrini should look at dropping Roberto for Martin, who with more than 300 Football League appearances is surely a better bet to deal with the inevitable aerial bombardment at Turf Moor. MBSeventy years ago this weekend (the precise anniversary falls on Tuesday) Sheffield United, then 10th in the Second Division, travelled to a Tottenham team that were five points clear at the top. What followed was a remorseless skewering: Guernsey-born Len Duquemin, the Channel Islands’ first great footballer, scored in the fifth minute and the 29th, Les Medley in the 24th and 34th, and Sonny Walters got a second-half hat-trick as Spurs won 7-0. Tottenham, in their first season under Arthur Rowe, were developing the “push and run” style that would bring them the Second Division title that season and win them the First Division a year later, but the defeat was to have a telling effect on the Blades: though they ended that day in 12th their form improved as the season progressed, to such an extent that when they completed their campaign they were in second place and all set for promotion. Unfortunately their city rivals Sheffield Wednesday, one point behind them, had a game still to play: they drew 0-0 and went up because their goal average was superior by a meagre 0.008. So had the Blades conceded only one fewer goal on that day in November they would have gone up instead – and to make matters worse, Wednesday’s opponents in that final game? Tottenham. SBWhisper it, but Steve Bruce now has an actual selection headache. The return of Florian Lejeune this week from a serious knee injury after almost a seven month-absence from first-team duty is a big boost for the Newcastle manager, even if it is the one area of the field in which he probably doesn’t currently need a boost. Newcastle’s defensive home form has been excellent with four goals conceded in six league games at St James’ Park this season, and hopes are high for the visit of Bournemouth after last week’s 3-2 away win at West Ham, where both Ciaran Clark and Federico Fernández chipped in with goals. With Fabian Schär in line to return alongside Jamaal Lascelles, suddenly Bruce has options for his three-man defence. Lejeune is short of match fitness but was one of the best players at the club last season, and it will be interesting to see who Bruce opts for at the back. MBBrighton have won three of their past four games to rise to their current league position of eighth, but the key question facing Graham Potter is whether to stick with the 4-4-2 formation that has brought those positive results, in which Aaron Connolly partners Neal Maupay in attack, or to leave the 19-year-old Irishman on the bench and start with a single centre forward in search of greater solidity, as he has in every away game except last month’s trip to Aston Villa, in which Aaron Mooy was sent off in the first half, Connolly was withdrawn at the break and Brighton lost 2-1. Should he take the more attacking option, it would be a demonstration not only of Brighton’s increased confidence but also of Manchester United’s diminished standing. Four of the past five games between these teams at Old Trafford have ended 1-0 to Manchester United, the exception being last season’s, which ended 2-1. SBThis game presents Wolves, who are following a run of six away games in seven with two home fixtures in four days, with a rapid opportunity to avenge their 2-1 away defeat in the Carabao Cup 10 days ago. But they have won only one home game in the league all season – against Watford, in what was possibly the visitors’ poorest display of the season – and are facing an Aston Villa team who are better than their league position suggests. Since August Villa have lost only at Arsenal (just – they were winning with nine minutes to play), at home to Liverpool (just – they were winning with three minutes to play) and at Manchester City, where they made it to half-time without conceding, and only five clubs have had more shots this season, while only Spurs and the current top five have outscored them.

So I spent a week attending social events to see if I could trick myself into being more naturally outgoingI was asked to torture myself for a week for this experiment. Well, not torture, but close enough for me. For a week, this introvert would put social awkwardness to one side and live as an extrovert. I don’t particularly enjoy meeting new people. I decline most party invitations and if I do go, I leave as soon as I can without causing offence. Sometimes I fantasise about doing what Princess Diana used to do when she wanted to lose friends – change her phone number. So the prospect of spending a week saying yes to every social engagement that came my way was about as appealing as a root canal treatment.But evidence shows that conquering your inner introversion can be good for your mental health. In the first study of its kind, researchers at the University of California asked 123 people to act as extroverts for a week. Participants were asked to be talkative, assertive and spontaneous in their daily interactions with other people. The following week, the same group was asked to act like introverts. The findings were remarkable.“It was the biggest effect we’ve ever found in any of our studies,” says Dr Sonja Lyubomirsky, the lead researcher. “When people acted extrovert, they experienced more positive emotions and satisfaction. When they acted introvert, they experienced fewer positive emotions.” She speculates that this is because, at heart, humans are social creatures. “Social relationships are inherently rewarding for us. We have a need to belong and to connect with each other.”She advises me to steer clear of small talk, which is good, because I loathe it. “If you spend the whole week talking about the weather, I think you’ll hate it.” Instead, go deep and be vulnerable. “Share something vulnerable about yourself, even if that seems terrifying. A person will match that normally and you will feel as if you’re making a friend.”Pan gives me a set of rules: no booze because it makes things easier, no taking a friend along for moral support – “That’s cheating!” – and I must spend an hour and a half at each engagement, minimum. Here goes nothing.I start the week by attending an Extinction Rebellion induction meeting. I have toyed with the idea of joining the movement for months, but put it off because none of my friends are members and the thought of going alone frightens me.In a chilly church hall, I take a seat in a circle of stacking chairs. There is a long pause while I steel myself to turn to the person next to me.“Hi,” I say. “I’m Sirin.”I start chatting to Ben, who has just moved into the area. He is a friendly bloke with a deep tan and a placid manner. Remembering Pan’s advice, I offer something vulnerable about myself. “I’ve wanted to come to these meetings for ages, but none of my friends wanted to come with me.” My anxieties tumble out. “Also I eat meat and fly, and I’m worried everyone here would judge me.”Ben looks at me kindly. After the meeting, he waves at me from the church steps. I’ll be back, I think.This evening I am playing dodgeball with strangers and all I can think about is how much I don’t want to do it. I was abysmal at team sports at school, and the thought of balls ricocheting around me feels like an anxiety dream. After checking the maximum velocity of a dodgeball (70mph), I panic and call Jacob, the Headshot United team coordinator, for some last-minute reassurance.“We’re really bad,” Jacob promises. “We’ve lost the last nine games. Besides, you can hide at the back. There will be a few people who wear knee pads and stuff like that – try not to worry about them.”I catch up with Jacob and his teammate, Ed, for a pre-game drink. “Someone joined us last week and said they didn’t have a good time and wouldn’t be coming back,” says Ed. I gulp.Jacob senses my anxiety. “If you really are hating it, you don’t have to keep playing,” he says.We head to a nearby school gym. Playing team sports with strangers was exactly like losing my virginity: not memorably awful, but definitely not good. I cringe every time a ball thuds my way and lack the strength to make my throws clear the other side of the court. Obviously, I get hit on the head. “You took that head shot like an absolute champ,” observes a teammate.While I didn’t enjoy dodgeball – hated it, if I’m honest – I loved meeting everyone. After the game (we lost), I hit the pub with Jacob and his teammate Will. “You’re not the worst newcomer we’ve ever had,” Jacob says.Today I am meeting up with Emma, whom I don’t know. We’re going to a Crossfit class – a famously social workout, where high fives, fist bumps and (God forbid) hugs with sweaty strangers are de rigueur.Emma introduces me to Rich, the owner of Crossfit Shapesmiths in south London. “I’M SO HAPPY TO MEET YOU,” Rich bellows at me. “COME HERE FOR A HUG. COME HERE!” We hug. “He’s like that with everyone,” Emma says. “He’s just really happy.”I meet JP, who will be leading the class. The workout flies by. Emma is a sweetheart. “You’re doing great!” she cheers, as I flub my way through some complicated moves involving a kettlebell. “Good pace!”After the class, JP instructs us – orders, really – to high five. Old Sirin would cringe at this enforced bonhomie, but new Sirin is all high fives. I’m just happy I didn’t get hit in the face.“What is a weed?” asks Cathy, the leader of Waltham Forest’s volunteer gardening group, “It’s a plant in the wrong place.”The group meets every Thursday morning to tend the grounds behind the William Morris Gallery in east London. Looking round, I can relate. I have never gardened before and most of the people here are regulars. Being a newbie among outsiders, doing something I have never done before – not my favourite thing.My goodness, they are a friendly bunch. We yank out weeds and fling them into a pile. It is a beautiful morning, crisp and clear. I make friends with Judith, who is retired and lives locally. “It’s difficult, making friends in London,” she says. “It’s not like you can just walk up to people in the street. They’d think you were a nutter.”After a tea break, I’m promoted to planting. I try not to look at the worms that tumble from my spade. “I just fling the worms away,” says Judith conspiratorially. We tuck the plants into the soil together, like children being put to bed. “You’ll come back, won’t you?” says Judith.I’m flagging. Pan warned me I would be tired and she was right. If my life were a night out, right now I would be sitting in the smoking area, begging a friend to fetch my coat. The last thing I want to do is hang out with a stranger.On Bumble BFF, a friendship app, I start chatting to Radhika, 25, a student from Delhi. We meet up later at an audiovisual exhibition about the natural world. It’s not the most successful meeting. Radhika is lovely, but it’s not the sort of place where you can chat and it’s awkward to be walking in silence with someone you have just met. As a result, Radhika and I never get past first base conversationally, which makes our interaction stilted, like kissing with braces. In the gallery, the sounds of the wilderness are compressed into a bright heartbeat of lasers. Radhika says she was homesick last week – it was the Diwali celebration. A few friends had had a gathering, but it wasn’t the same. I feel guilty for co-opting her into my experiment. Moving to a new place on your own is hard.A lot of my anxiety around socialising is linked to the fact that I often feel responsible for making conversation, as I do today. The encounter was wearing, probably because I already felt drained. After the exhibition, I suggest a drink, but Radhika declines. I’m relieved.I wake up with a ball of dread in my stomach that won’t go away . Why? I’m going to a Halloween party tonight, full of people I don’t know, and I’ll be flying solo.As evening approaches, the feeling intensifies. I desperately don’t want to go and find myself tidying drawers and sorting laundry until I can’t put off going any longer.Outside the house, I text Pan for some last-minute support. “ARGH I DON’T WANT TO GO TO THIS PARTY ON MY OWN.” She texts back. “Talk to three people and if they suck, you can leave. Also, ask the host to introduce you to some people.”I take a breath and ring the bell.Ordinarily, the hardest part of going to a party alone is walking in, not knowing anyone. In my case, it was realising once through the door that not only did I not know anyone, they were all in fancy dress. Luckily, the host Dan (not his real name) or, rather, Emperor Caligula – takes me under his wing. He introduces me to Gosia and Ula, sisters from Poland. Pan’s tip to let myself be vulnerable definitely helps: I tell Gosia and Ula about my anxieties and they look after me all evening as carefully as if I were a baby bird.It’s a great party. There is a severed head in the freezer and drinks are served in IV bags – but I’m so tired after the week’s exertions that I only last a few hours before making my excuses. “Your costume was awful,” Dan says, walking me to the door.I am comfortably the youngest person by a few decades on today’s walk, which is organised by the London Strollers. It’s no bother – one of the joys of my week of extroversion has been the opportunity to chat to older people.About 30 of us set off on a three-hour walk around north London. Things do not start off well. Although the woman I had been walking with seems friendly initially, she then makes a number of offensive comments. The thought of having to spend the morning listening to her fills me with a crushing ennui. I am already so tired. I don’t think I can bear this.Then Elizabeth comes to my rescue. She is very tall and upright, a headscarf knotted under her chin – my knight in a green raincoat.We talk about everything. How she has just got into football and is learning Italian, which will be her sixth language. Her childhood in Finland, and the 40 years she spent as a nurse. (She retired five years ago, at the age of 70.) She tells me about her husband, a communist, who died. And her children, who also died. And why you should only marry someone with the same political views as yours – preferably a communist. “Socialists, they sit on the fence,” Elizabeth shrugs, striding up Primrose Hill.I loved meeting Elizabeth. I could have talked to her all day. I take her number and we make loose plans to go to a protest together.So what did I learn from my week of extroversion? That people are kinder than you think and it is often easier to be truthful with strangers. That you should open yourself up to new experiences because the worst that can happen is getting hit in the face with a dodgeball, and that is not so bad. That we are all of us inidual moving dots, part of the same involuntary palpitating life, crisscrossing as we walk the streets. It’s nice for the dots to collide sometimes, even for a little while. Strangers can come together and share their stories. We all have a story to tell.I’m still an introvert and I don’t see that changing soon. But perhaps you will see me a bit more from now on. Maybe.

Get insider’s advice from local Oisín Higney, seven (with the help of brother Milo, 17, and mum Kate) Cambridge is brilliant and my Granny Eva lives there too. It has a river and loads of museums and parks. It is fun to travel there by train. I’d like to be a train driver when I grow up, or maybe a pilot. Last time, we shared our seats with another family and I got to watch Paw Patrol on another boy’s iPad. So I made a new friend, which was awesome. Do you want to know what I like to do in Cambridge?Cambridge University Botanic Garden is very near the station and is great to run around. It has a fountain, a mini-maze and stepping stones over a little lake. I think that the tall yellow grass plants look like fur. I like to hide behind the trees. You can’t climb them as it might hurt the branches. I like to make up games in the rock garden instead. The greenhouse is not green but it is hot and made of glass. Go to see the big cactuses and pretend you are a cowboy. They have very prickly spines so watch out. Also, there is a lily pad big enough for a frog the size of me.From here you can walk into town by following the river. You go over lots of bridges. If you want you can play in the Lammas Land playground. In summer, there are brown cows in Coe Fen and Midsummer Common. Real cows, you say, in the middle of Cambridge? Yes there are, and it’s kind of cool.At the Mill Pond, by the Mathematical Bridge, there are lots of people on small boats called punts. An adult has to stand up with a long pole. It looks like they are fishing but really they are pushing the boats along. We went on a punt and ate strawberries. The man who pushed us was really good at ducking down under the bridges and not falling off. You can even go at night on a Bat Punt Safari. Spooky!Do you like skateparks, tennis or playgrounds? Jesus Green has them all, right next to the river. Sometimes we go to the family runs on Sunday morning in Milton Country Park. I can run really fast. The Science Centre has a cool marble run, and the Centre for Computing History has a lot of retro games that my dad knows all about.There are lots of buildings that look like castles in the middle of Cambridge. King’s College looks like a church castle and Trinity College is where a man called Newton went. He had an apple fall on his head, and then he invented gravity, which is very cool. Did you know that there is a banana tree in Cambridge? It’s in Pembroke College. See if you can find the big Corpus Clock made of real gold. I think it is funny as it doesn’t even tell the time. It has a mechanical insect on the top, and if you wait for ages, his eye blinks. If you like climbing high you can see the whole of Cambridge from Great St Mary’s Church Steeple. Just don’t get stuck next to the bell when it rings! It can be fun to to explore the small streets in the centre, you could even do a treasure trail. If I get tired of walking, we go into Heffers, Waterstones or the Central Library and look at children’s books.Did I say that there were loads of museums? Just on Downing Street there are three, like the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. Find the bronze statue of Mr Sedgwick. He is holding a hammer and a trilobite shell that is 500m years old, which is older than my mum. My favourite is the huge fin whale at the Museum of Zoology. It hangs on the ceiling and it’s ginormous. You can look up and see all its bones and teeth. I also like the stuffed animals, games, and big screen with tiny square TVs of different creatures. My brother says we have to look after animals or they just get extinct. There is a museum that also looks like a castle. It is the Fitzwilliam and when you get in the ceiling is really high. You have got to see the Egyptian mummies, the knight’s armour and the swords – they are awesome. If you like real animals, then the red pandas in Shepreth Wildlife Park are really cute. It is right next to Shepreth train station, just a few minutes outside Cambridge.Aromi has tasty Sicilian margherita pizza that you eat from a wooden plate. I love the dark chocolate ice-cream. My brother likes Bill’s restaurant, as he says it has delicious buttermilk pancakes with bacon and the staff are really friendly. They are only served at brunch so you must be early. He also likes the spicy chicken rolls in Pho (Vietnamese). La Margherita has nice pasta, and is near Kettles Yard Art Gallery. The MillWorks has a real gigantic wheel in the middle and is right next to the river. My favourite is a plain burger and fries at Byron Burger or Honest Burger, but it has to have ketchup. If you want some treats for the train home, there are Chelsea buns in Fitzbillies. On Mill Road, near the station, you can get nice cakes in the Urban Larder or Norfolk Street Bakery. And if you want an apple to fall on your head and have a big idea, you can go to the Orchard Tea Garden in Grantchester for strawberry jam scones and sit under the trees in a deckchair.Take a trip to Cambridge. Up to four kids per adult can travel with Thameslink on most journeys for as little as £2 on Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets (T\u0026ampCs apply).

London can get very busy because lots of people want to come here. You might not know this but it’s great being a little kid in a big city because there’s lots to do and it’s easy to get about. It’s fastest to go on the train because then you don’t get stuck in traffic. I like to do crossword puzzles waiting at the station and to wave at the driver. All aboard? Off we go …Start right in the middle of London – literally, because Blackfriars station is on the river. It’s right next to a big art museum called Tate Modern. There are cool exhibitions with light-up kaleidoscopes and swings. Outside, look for the performers by the river who blow massive bubbles so big you can jump inside. Watch out for the statues. They are not real statues, but people dressed up in gold.Walk past Shakespeare’s Globe theatre and on to Borough Market where you can eat any sort of food you fancy. Maybe sausages or a big lunch like paella and the most ginormous fudgy chocolate brownie. Look out for the new Thames virtual reality experience by One London Bridge. It’s like a big pair of goggles that lets you see all the wildlife in the Thames, like seahorses, seals and even dolphins and sharks.You have to go to Tower Bridge because at the top there’s a glass walkway. It looks like you’re standing on air. Me and my mum and little sister lay down on the glass and it was super duper scary but really exciting. It feels like you’re flying above the buses and boats below. The road rises up to let tall ships in and out of London. From the top you can see an old warship called HMS Belfast, the jungle at the Sky Garden, lots of skyscrapers like the Shard, and the Tower of London.The Tower of London is a real palace where the Crown Jewels live. They look delicious, but they’re rocks not sweets and you’re not allowed to lick them. The crown has a sparkly disco ball on top, which is cool. You can go on a tour and meet the ravens and look at the king’s armour. It’s silly there isn’t any armour for queens. Why isn’t there any? If I was the Queen I’d want my own armour.The train takes you right past the Shard and St Paul’s Cathedral to Greenwich. Climb aboard the big ship from long, long ago called the Cutty Sark. You can run up and down on the deck but you’re not allowed to jump off the railings. You’re not allowed to jump on the little bunk beds either, but it’s fun to play in the captain’s cabin. The ship isn’t in the water. It’s in a big hall with a cafe where you can get a kids’ lunchbox or a fancy afternoon tea with lots of little cakes.Don’t bother with the meridian line. It’s not time travel like I thought it would be. It’s just a line with lots of people queuing up to take boring photos. But you might like the space exhibition at the planetarium in the Royal Observatory. You can fly to the sun or land on Mars and see what a star looks like when it is born.The National Maritime Museum is my favourite because it’s got a big kids’ zone. You can climb the rigging, fix old boats, dress up like a pirate, catch pretend lobsters and sell them in the crab shop. Upstairs by the cafe there’s a giant map you can run all over. You can stand on your country and run across the ocean. Russia is very big. England is teeny weeny. In the grownup part of the museum there is Lord Nelson’s jacket with a bullet hole in the shoulder, paintings by Turner, who I’m learning about in school, and figureheads from old boats, which I used to be scared of. My mum got me a little baby turtle (not a real one) in the gift shop. She’s called Turtle.On Sunday morning come to Junior Parkrun in Wimbledon Park. It’s free but you have to register. I run 2km with my friends Josie, Alex and Emily. Sometimes I walk. After Parkrun you can get peanut butter ice-cream or strawberry sorbet in the park cafe. Sometimes the sprinklers are on if you want to cool down. Wimbledon Park has everything: a big lake where kids can sail their own boats, an obstacle course, two playgrounds (for babies and older children), mini golf and beach volleyball. I prefer playing sports to watching them so I haven’t been to the famous tennis court in Wimbledon but my nana and grampy have been to the museum there and they ate a lot of strawberries. They didn’t bring any home for me.The best lunch is in Wimbledon Village, which looks like the country but it is in London. Everybody will like a margherita at the pizza van. They do spicy pizzas for grownups too. The orange juice at Megan’s on the High Street is the most delicious drink I’ve ever had.Before you get on the train home, walk up to Wimbledon Common where you can make dens out of big sticks and leaves. It is a good idea to wear wellies. There’s lots of colourful flowers and wildlife, like birds and squirrels and dogs. Once I saw a beautiful brown horse.All aboardUp to four kids per adult can travel with Thameslink on most journeys for as little as £2 on Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets (T\u0026ampCs apply).

Say hello to Worthing: the lesser-known beachside beauty with bucket-and-spades-full of family fun. Lola Davies, aged 13 (with a little help from mum Tracey), gives us the inside scoop on family time in her favourite seaside spot by Lola and Tracey DaviesI’m going to call this guide “The Importance of Being Worthing”, because my English teacher says that Oscar Wilde spent a summer here in 1894 – and wrote The Importance of Being Earnest in Worthing.Only a 25-minute train ride from where I live in Brighton, Worthing’s where we come when Brighton gets a bit too busy. It’s a traditional Georgian seaside resort, with an art deco pier (which won Pier of the Year 2019), old-fashioned amusements and ice-cream parlours, a new big wheel and a lovely, long pebbly beach.When the sun shines ...It’s easy for us to get to Worthing from Brighton, but Londoners can get there easily too – the direct train from London Victoria only takes 90 minutes. This year, the Worthing Observation Wheel opened. At 46 metres high, it’s the tallest observation wheel on the south coast, and is open from April to October. While you can’t quite see my house from the top, it has amazing views all along the coast and across the South Downs national park.If you don’t fancy swimming in the sea then go to Splashpoint, a fun leisure centre with slides and a ing pool that is close to the beach.For smaller kids, say eight and under, I recommend The Worthing Lido, a small amusement park with rides like the spinning teacups and the Disney Express train. My brother, sister and I always like playing on the 2p slot machines in the arcade.Is Worthing worth it on a rainy day?We don’t just come to Worthing when it’s sunny. Sometimes I like it more when it’s not, as it means we can go to the Dome Cinema on the seafront. It was called The Kursaal when it opened in 1911 and had a rollerskating rink on the ground floor and a cinema on the top floor. It’s a shame it doesn’t have the rollerskating rink any more, but I like watching films in the old-fashioned auditorium with vintage seats. My mum says it was in the movie Wish You Were Here, which was filmed in Worthing, and there’s lots of old cinema memorabilia in the Projectionist’s Bar.On the way down to the beach, we pass Harold Pinter’s old house, and pop in to the Worthing Museum and Art Gallery. It’s free to enter and has loads of cool stuff, like piles of Roman coins and tools found nearby at Cissbury Ring, an iron age fort. I like the 19th- and 20th-century clothes they have on display – Mum always swoons over the sparkly Chanel dress from the 1930s. But my favourite bit is the cabinet of swimming costumes throughout the years. I think it’s crazy that people back then used to wear knitted bathers!Getting hungry?While I’m happy with candy floss and ice-cream, the folks insist on having something more substantial when we visit Worthing. The Beach House on the seafront is one of my favourite places. Located between the pier and the Dome, it has a sunny terrace overlooking the beach and serves posh burgers, lots of vegan and vegetarian things (for my veggie sister) and local craft beer for thirsty parents.If we don’t want to leave the beach, Mum will order a takeaway from Pizzaface, a cool Brighton pizza shop that has just opened in Worthing. They also like CrabShack, another little restaurant by the sea that serves fresh crab and zingy cockle popcorn. But for a special meal try Pitch on Warwick Street, which is run by local chef Kenny Tutt, the winner of MasterChef 2018.Old-fashioned seaside treatsWhen I was younger, I loved riding a quadracycle, one of those big four-wheeled bikes with a stripy roof, along the seafront. But now I’m 13, it’s become a bit embarrassing to ride one with your parents!One thing I’ll never grow out of, though, is a knickerbocker glory from Macari’s, a cafe and ice-cream parlour on the seafront that’s retro inside. Apparently it’s been open for nearly 60 years, and has always been run by the same family. Mum says the knickerbocker glory still tastes the same as when she was a kid.It’s about a 15-minute walk from Macari’s back to the train station, just in time to catch one of the regular trains back home to Brighton.All aboardUp to four kids per adult can travel on most journeys for as little as £2 on Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets with Southern (T\u0026ampCs apply).

And then a figure, at the edge of his vision. Now something grabbed his fingers or stroked his arm. There was more – and it was happening more frequently.“I saw a Catholic priest,” said the man. “But he couldn’t help. Can you?”Yes, yes I could. I knew exactly what he needed to do.I was a fortune teller. Every Sunday, I climbed the stairs of an old terrace house in Sydney’s historic Rocks district, to sit in the attic and ine the future. I would read Tarot cards or interpret horoscopes.As a teenager, I’d devoured a book called Positive Magic. An instruction manual for witches, its central idea was that if you wanted something, and you had good intentions, you just told the universe and magic would happen. Although nothing I wanted (fame, money, hot boyfriend) actually arrived, one thing led to another and I taught myself to read Tarot cards. At the time I was a science student, and just considered it a fun game at parties.That changed after I took my cards to my part-time job and read them for a colleague during the break. She picked the card for pregnancy, which we laughed about, because she wanted her tubes tied.A week later she said, “Guess what the doctor told me this morning?”She was pregnant, and I was officially psychic.Deciding to develop my gift, I enrolled in a psychic class, where I learned to say the first thing that popped into my head. “Your first thoughts are the most psychic ones, before your rational mind interferes,” said the teacher.I also learned that all things are connected, and everything is a symbol of something else. Suddenly, I saw signs and omens everywhere.To test my new skills, I volunteered to be a clairvoyant at the spiritualist church. Congregants would place a flower on the table, and the clairvoyants would choose one and “read” it at the microphone. Nervous, the first thing I grabbed was a packet of silver foil. The rose inside had been packed so tightly, its petals were crushed. I didn’t get a single vibe from it, so I just described the symbolism.“You are feeling battered and bruised,” I said.Afterwards, a woman approached and said she was a victim of domestic violence, and what should she do?I was only 19 and had no idea, but my psychic reputation soared. The attention was intoxicating.Then the universe told me I wasn’t cut out for science, by sending me my second-year results. I dropped out to pursue theatre and also signed up for a one-year course at the Sydney Astrology Centre, a cavernous commercial building in a seedy part of town.The course began with the meanings of the zodiac, from Aries to Aquarius. Then the luminaries the sun (what you will become), the moon (what you brought into this life) and planets. After that, how to calculate planetary positions and cast horoscopes.Although astrologers use Nasa data for their calculations, horoscopes aren’t a true map of the heavens. The Babylonians who invented astrology believed the sun rotated round the Earth modern astrologers still use Earth-centred charts, as if Copernicus had never existed. That’s only the start of the scientific problems.The astrological meanings themselves derive from a principle called sympathetic magic, where things that look alike are linked together. Mars looks red, so it rules red things like blood. How do you get blood? You cut, so Mars rules surgery and war.You forecast by combining meanings with planetary movements. Say Saturn, planet of restrictions, is about to transit the First House of self – your life will contract! You’re going to get more responsibilities than usual. Or maybe you’ll be denied the chance to take on more responsibilities. Or maybe a cold, critical person will come into your life. But anyway, it’s a good time to go on a diet.Astrology is one big word association game.I loved it, though I was losing interest in other mystical practices. Partly I didn’t have time, because I was now immersed in theatre while working as a temp typist at St Vincent’s, a Catholic hospital. But as I bounced from one department to another, my views changed. I’d understood organised religion to be something between an embarrassment and an evil. Yet as Aids did its dreadful work – this was the 1990s – I watched nuns offer compassionate care to the dying. Christian volunteers checked on derelict men with vomit down their clothes. I became uncomfortably aware that New Agers do not build hospitals or feed alcoholics – they buy self-actualisation at the cash register.Finally, I was accepted into a music degree and my days filled with classes, my nights with rehearsals. This caused a cash crisis, because I could only do office work during academic holidays. When I saw the ad for a fortune teller, I pounced.My credentials impressed the man on the counter (“My name is Ron,” he said. “My spirit guide is Blue Star. He’s on the intergalactic committee”) and I was hired.We charged A$50 an hour, a significant sum at the time, and I wanted to offer value. No fishing for clues from me – I printed a horoscope or laid the cards and started interpreting immediately, intending to dazzle the customer with my insights.Half the time, though, I couldn’t get a word in. It turned out what most people want is the chance to unload for an hour. The range of problems faced by people who can afford $50 for fortune telling turned out to be limited: troubles with romance, troubles at work, trouble mustering the courage for a much-needed change. I heard these stories so often I could often guess what the problem was the moment someone walked in. Heartbroken young men, for example, talk about it to psychics, because it’s less risky than telling their friends. Sometimes I’d mischievously say, “Let her go. She’s not worth it,” as soon as one arrived. Once I heard, “Oh my God, oh my GOD!” as an amazed guy fell backwards down the stairs.I also learned that intelligence and education do not protect against superstition. Many customers were stockbrokers, advertising executives or politicians, dealing with issues whose outcomes couldn’t be controlled. It’s uncertainty that drives people into woo, not stupidity, so I’m not surprised millennials are into astrology. They grew up with Harry Potter and graduated into a precarious economy, making them the ideal customers.What broke the spell for me was, oddly, people swearing by my gift. Some repeat customers claimed I’d made very specific predictions, of a kind I never made. It dawned on me that my readings were a co-creation – I would weave a story and, later, the customer’s memory would add new elements. I got to test this theory after a friend raved about a reading she’d had, full of astonishingly accurate predictions. She had a tape of the session, so I asked her to play it.The clairvoyant had said none of the things my friend claimed. Not a single one. My friend’s imagination had done all the work.Yet sometimes I could be uncannily accurate – wasn’t that proof I was psychic? One Sunday, I went straight from work to a party, before I’d had time to shuck off my psychic persona. A student there mentioned she wasn’t sure what to specialize in – photography, graphic design or maybe industrial design?“Do photography,” I said.She looked at me, wide-eyed. “How did you know?” she said, explaining photography was her real love, but her parents didn’t approve.I couldn’t say, “because my third eye is open”, so I reflected for a moment. Then it hit me. “You sounded happier when you said ‘photography’,” I said. My psychic teacher was right – the signals we pick up before conscious awareness kicks in can be accurate and valuable.Well, maybe I wasn’t psychic, but it didn’t matter. It was just entertainment, after all, until the cursed man came in. The one who’d seen the Catholic priest.“Get to a doctor,” I told him. “Now.”That very week, I’d typed letters for a neurologist who specialized in brain diseases. Some of those letters had documented strikingly similar symptoms to this man.“Are you saying I’m crazy?” he said, his hands balled.“No,” I reassured him. “But Catholic priests know what they’re doing. If he couldn’t help, this isn’t a curse.”That made the man angrier.“You’re a fraud!” he shouted, and stormed downstairs to demand his money back.The encounter shook me, badly. Shortly afterwards, I packed my astrology books and Tarot cards away for good.I can still make the odd forecast, though. Here’s one: the venture capital pouring into astrology apps will create a fortune telling system that works, because humans are predictable. As people follow the advice, the apps’ predictive powers will increase, creating an ever-tighter electronic leash. But they’ll be hugely popular – because if you sprinkle magic on top, you can sell people anything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af628bf8287019b88d9c70c845ccf8084b89e195/437_572_2670_1602/master/2670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b6ca4025652783009e5908c8516ae08","title":"have you seen any uk political adverts without disclosures on social media general election","story":"During the general election campaign we would like to hear about the political adverts you have seen on social media From 22 November political adverts will be banned on Twitter, however, other social media platforms such as Facebook will still allow them on their sites.Ahead of the UK general election we would like you to help us collect examples of political adverts running on social media which do not mention who has sponsored them.Political adverts on Facebook should clearly state who has paid for them in their posts.However, commercial adverts do not say who they are “paid for by” but only show that they are sponsored.If you have seen any political content on social media that does not clearly state who has paid for it we would like to hear from you.If you see an advert that does not say “paid for by” screenshot it.

You could call Beautiful But Deadly a belated attempt to jump on the Def Jam rap-rock bandwagon, but it’s smarter than that. Its distorted guitars are based not on heavy metal, but psychedelic soul: Eddie Hazel’s stellar turn on Funkadelic’s Maggot Brain provides the blueprint. Either way, it rocks.Addictive was a track that turned into a nightmare: an uncleared sample of Indian artist Lata Mangeshkar by original producer DJ Quik led to a $500m lawsuit and an injunction to prevent it being broadcast or performed. Dre’s remix is still fabulous: Indian flutes, sitars and vocals fighting for space with high-drama synth stabs.While the Lady of Rage’s moment in the spotlight was brief, it produced one indisputable classic. Afro Puffs takes Dre’s post-Chronic sound down a dark and sinister alley – heavy, atonal bass, oddly creepy percussive clatter, high G-funk synths wailing off-key – while Rage offers a surprisingly woke lyrical stance for a Death Row artist, covering body positivity and Afrocentric beauty. Willow Smith has claimed the lyrics “changed my life”.By the time Popped Off slipped out on TI’s mixtape Fuck Da City Up, Dre’s production work was becoming sporadic, his attention presumably consumed by the Beats company that would make him a self-proclaimed billionaire. But Popped Off is a low-key reaffirming of his skill: a huge beat and sample snipped from Kool and the Gang’s Summer Madness turned into an epic fanfare.Dre’s handful of mid-80s productions for the World Class Wreckin Cru showed promise, but NWA’s Straight Outta Compton was something else. Express Yourself’s use of the bouncy Charles Wright original was a masterstroke, both commercially minded and at odds with NWA’s relentlessly grim subject matter: even the relatively benign lyrics here are filled with violence.There was a marked decline in the quality of MCs Dre worked with in the early 00s: 50 Cent wasn’t anything like as talented as Eminem, and the Game wasn’t anything like as talented as 50 Cent. How We Do’s success rests on Dre’s spare, gripping production: a spindly hook endlessly repeated over old-school 808 beats.In 1996 Dre wisely fled Death Row, a label about to go horrifyingly out of control, but not before producing one final anthem. Like Blackstreet’s No Diggity, which Dre worked on incognito, California Love is powered by a piano riff – this one sampled from Joe Cocker’s 1972 track Woman to Woman. He also paid homage to funk pioneer Roger Troutman, whose talk box provides the hook.In the aftermath of Eminem’s vast success, Bilal made for an unlikely Dr Dre collaborator: a “conscious” neo-soul artist, affiliated to Questlove’s Soulquarians collective. But Fast Lane is amazing: the Curtis Mayfield-esque vocal and lush harmonies crashing against a sinister Dre beat, decorated with an eerie, shimmering organ and crawling analogue synth.He is effortlessly out-rapped by Eminem – whose spectacular guest appearance was later lauded by Kendrick Lamar as the best verse on Dre’s album 2001 – but the producer’s bullish recounting of his achievements is lent weight by how good the music is: the perfect expression of 2001’s chilly, bare post-G-funk sound.After the dazzling invention and technical brilliance of Eminem, Dre’s next superstar protege was a backwards step, with tired gangsta cliches exploiting a lurid backstory. That said, 50 Cent sold millions, and at their best his collaborations with Dre have a creepy power. In Da Club is as about as bleak and omnious-sounding a party-starting banger as it is possible to imagine.The closing track of Dre’s 2015 album Compton sounded remarkably like Dre bidding farewell to his career as a rapper. If so, it’s a great soundtrack to the end credits: flurries of strings sampled from François de Roubaix’s Dernier Domicile Connu (also the source for, of all things, Robbie Williams’s Supreme) and live horns, including an exquisite jazzy solo.Despite Dre’s protestations, Let Me Blow Ya Mind demonstrated how adaptable to pop 2001’s sound was. The beat could have been on that album, Eve’s rap is suitably tough, but Gwen Stefani’s chorus is the perfect sweetener: it became a global smash.Easily overlooked amid The Chronic’s bigger hits, Lil’ Ghetto Boy is the album’s emotional centre. In place of NWA’s furious screw-you nihilism, it feels equivocal, thoughtful, even troubled by the cycle of street life it depicts, a mood embodied by the mournful Donny Hathaway sample that provides its chorus.It’s de rigueur to point out that the sample on My Name Is was played by Chas and Dave more important is how brilliantly Dre uses it. In contrast to G-funk’s slickness, it sounds slightly ungainly, jerky and off-kilter even – as Dre suggested – “annoying”: the perfect backdrop for Eminem to introduce his disturbing Slim Shady character.Dre’s post-NWA solo debut was a ferocious statement of intent. As a rapper, he’s upstaged by Snoop, but it’s all about the beat, which turns a sample from Sly and the Family Stone’s joyous Sing a Simple Song into something ominous, overlaid with a double bass and off-key horns. Big Pun’s 1998 version of the same rhythm, Twinz, might be even better.NWA’s 1991 album Efil4zaggin is so unremittingly unpleasant that its actual sound gets overlooked: what price skilful beats next to lyrics as foul as those on One Less Bitch? Nevertheless, the beats are a quantum leap on from Straight Outta Compton, as shown on its opening track: a vast, potent patchwork of samples, including a fabulous hook snatched from white funk-rockers Rare Earth.All the singles taken from Doggystyle are brilliant: the first might be the best. An imperious updating of the cluttered sound of P-Funk, Who Am I?’s sound is thick with George Clinton samples, its bassline elastic and supremely funky, its grinding, squealing synths adding a hint of unease. That it ended up on a Money Supermarket advert tells you a lot about Snoop and Dre’s journey from folk devils to beloved institution.Dre’s late 90s were rocky: early releases on his label Aftermath were coolly received, rumours abounded regarding his failure to follow up The Chronic. But the album 2001 was a swaggering return. Still DRE sounds supremely confident: there’s virtually nothing to the track beyond one insistent sample and the occasional synth flutter, but it’s utterly addictive.The single that introduced the world to G-funk via Dre’s patent blend of 70s soul samples – in this case Leon Haywood – and analogue synth tones (the trademark “funky worm” whine was created on a Moog). Its brilliance, as here, lay in the contrast between the sound’s warm nostalgia for the music of childhood and the harshness of the lyrics it supported.The video for Family Affair features a brief cameo by its producer: with a broad grin, Dre lifts his arms in triumph. As well he might. It might seem wilfully perverse to pick one of his poppiest productions as his greatest, but Dre’s snappy adaptability to different artists and eras has always been among his strongest skills. And besides, Family Affair is just a no-further-questions moment of perfection, such a fantastic, irresistible single as to disarm any criticism. Its construction is simple – an unrelenting two-chord piano line, staccato strings and the occasional subtle synthesised whoosh supporting one of Mary J Blige’s most economical and understated vocals and the most earworm-y of melodies. The cumulative effect is undeniable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3266f40b2ed5317f7cebf4a3a6b06a7bda06d194/0_772_5915_3547/master/5915.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40b6a0055cfc625619ec47fc4e686287","title":"fka twigs magdalene review","story":"(Young Turks)Tahliah Barnett moves further into abstraction on this personal, painstaking and wildly adventurous recordThe rise of FKA twigs is one of the most intriguing in modern pop. It has not been an ascent to dizzying commercial success: her releases sell respectably rather than astonishingly. It’s more about the acclaim she’s achieved. Rock and pop stars of any stripe usually struggle to convince the world that they’re actually polymath geniuses FKA twigs – AKA Tahliah Barnett – seems to have been accepted as one from the start. In the five years since her debut album, she has ersified into everything from arty webzines in which she features as a comic strip superhero called Anomalie to starring in a commercial for Apple directed by Spike Jonze. Live, she frequently spends more time engaged in choreography than actually singing, as if music is a secondary pursuit to abstract tap-dancing and demonstrating her mastery of sword-based kung fu. Her videos aren’t just promotional items but exercises in visual art with mini-documentaries attached, explaining the practice behind them.Critics could have greeted all this with scepticism, for distracting from the music that drew people to her in the first place, but quite the opposite. The uniformly rhapsodic response to it all has seen Barnett fast-tracked into a very rarefied space, spoken of in the same breath as Kate Bush and Björk, not as a lazy comparison but as their contemporary auteur heir.The praise is sometimes deserved – but not always. Magdalene’s sound cuts almost all Barnett’s ties with the “alt-R\u0026ampB” label that attached itself to her debut (and which she has decried as racist). Instead, she heads further into the realms of abstraction: a discombobulating aural scrapbook of pummelling, funeral march percussion, slivers of eerie electronics and white noise and warped samples of voices. As in one of the videos for which Bennett learns pole dancing, martial arts, oncological neurosurgery, hang-gliding or whatever, you can sense the pains that have been staked in its making. However chaotic the musical backdrop appears to get, you know everything has been very carefully assembled, that not a note or a beat or a wisp of feedback is out of place, that nothing has happened at random. It’s strange enough to make the ordinary moments jarring, as when rapper Future appears on Holy Terrain, rhyming over a straightforward beat, Auto-Tune cranked up to full.Sometimes the results are stunning, as on the beautiful microcosmos of tiny, constantly shifting sounds that fade in and out of Mary Magdalene. Or on Home With You, with its rhythm track made up of bursts of static interference, noises that sound like distorted gunshots, whoops that sound like someone catching their breath mid-sob. Barnett’s voice seems to have shifted slightly from her debut, becoming more refined. A high, perfectly enunciated RP quaver that sounds like a postwar BBC announcer on the verge of tears, it’s definitely an acquired taste but capable of sounding simultaneously wracked and icy – an impressive ruse to pull off.Sometimes, however, the songs are weirdly stifling. Magdalene is clearly a very personal work: a breakup album that ruminates on the power of female sexuality and the toxic effects of fame and media intrusion on one’s personal life (Barnett became an unlikely tabloid fixture after dating actor Robert Pattinson). “If I walk out the door it wakes a thousand eyes,” protests opener Thousand Eyes. “They want to see us alone, they want to see us apart,” notes closer Cellophane, bitterly. But there are moments where the music seems to work against the listener fully engaging with the emotions of the songs. Fallen Alien features a lot of clever production touches – beats that sound like swords clashing, unexpected explosions of industrial clamour, high-drama bursts of sped-up backing vocals – allied to a meandering, episodic tune. The result is something you admire for its audacity, and for the fastidious technique involved, rather than immerse yourself in.There are very good songs here that would pack a punch stripped of the accompanying sonic barrage – Bad Day, Mary Magdalene, the exquisitely careworn Mirrored Heart – but occasionally the sound seems like scaffolding to support some quite slender material: the two lines of melody that make up Thousand Eyes the repetitious Day Bed.And yet, for all its variable quality, you don’t finish Magdalene mystified as to why FKA twigs has attracted so much praise. Her ambition is lofty. She shows a genuine desire to press forward, to create something new, and that is utterly at odds with huge swathes of current British pop, where trying to fit in and appear as normal as possible is very much the order of the day. Magdalene is not carefully constructed to slot unobtrusively into a curated streaming playlist. Its highlights achieve their ambition in a genuinely impressive style, and if other moments fall short, it’s not for want of trying. At a time when a lot of twigs’s peers aren’t trying to do much more than tick boxes, that’s laudable in itself.Cate Le Bon and Bradford Cox: SecretaryArt-rock summit meeting yields hauntingly rickety song: out-of-tune piano, ramshackle percussion, spoken-word interlude from the Deerhunter frontman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/748f44d37b0473b31c906d60c3022a8c9759cdc4/0_0_4689_2814/master/4689.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d6d4f9899488a0e2b718014e07439d0","title":"the dice man elusive author luke rhinehart george cockroft emmanuel carrere","story":"A search for the mysterious author of a counterculture classic led to someone else entirely. Or did it? By  Emmanuel CarrèreToward the end of the 1960s, Luke Rhinehart worked as a psychoanalyst in New York and was bored stiff. He lived in a pretty apartment with a nice view. He practised yoga, read books on Zen, dreamed vaguely of joining a commune but did not dare. As a therapist, he was resolutely nondirective. If a patient who still had not lost his virginity was plagued by sadistic impulses and said on Rhinehart’s couch that he would like to rape and kill a little girl, his professional ethics obliged him to repeat with a calm voice: “You’d like to rape and kill a little girl?” No judgment. But what he wanted to say was: “Well, go ahead, then! If what really turns you on is raping and killing a little girl, then stop boring me with this fantasy. Do it!”He checked himself before coming out with such monstrosities, but they obsessed him more and more. His own fantasies were nothing extreme – not enough to get him sent to prison – but like everyone else, he stopped himself going through with them. What Luke would have liked, for example, was to sleep with Arlene, the wife of his colleague Jake Ecstein, who lived across the landing. But as a faithful husband, he let the idea simmer away in the back of his mind.So life plods on, calm and dreary, until one night after a dinner party, when he has had a little too much to drink. Rhinehart sees a dice lying on the carpet, a banal playing dice, and gets the idea of throwing it and acting on its instructions. He says to himself: “If it lands on a number from two to six, I’ll do what I would have done anyway: bring the dirty glasses back to the kitchen, brush my teeth, take a double aspirin, go to bed beside my sleeping wife, and maybe masturbate discreetly thinking of Arlene. But if I roll a one, I’ll do what I really want to do: I know Arlene’s at home alone tonight, so I’ll go across the hall, knock on her door and sleep with her.”The dice lands on one. Rhinehart hesitates, feeling vaguely that he is standing on a threshold: if he crosses it, his life could change. But it is not his decision, it is the dice’s, so he obeys. Arlene opens the door in a negligee she is surprised but not put out. When Rhinehart comes back home two extremely pleasant hours later, he realises that he has changed. He did something he wouldn’t normally do.From now on, he always consults the dice. Since it has six sides, he gives it six options. The first is to do what he has always done. The five others depart more or less distinctly from this routine. Once it has been subjected to the dice, even the most anodyne choice – that of a film, a restaurant – opens a vast array of possibilities for putting your routine behind you.His choices soon become more audacious. Going somewhere he would never go, getting to know people he would otherwise never meet. He pushes his patients to leave their families and jobs, to change their political and sexual orientations. His reputation suffers, but Rhinehart does not care. What he likes, now, is doing the exact opposite of what he would normally do: putting salt in his coffee, jogging in a tuxedo, going to work in shorts, pissing in the flowerpots, walking backward, sleeping under his bed. His wife finds him strange, but he says it is a psychological experiment, and she lets herself be lulled into believing it. Until the day he gets the idea of initiating his children.One weekend when their mother is not there, Rhinehart gets his little boy and girl to play this apparently innocent game: you write six things you would like to do on a piece of paper, and the dice chooses one of them. It all goes well at the start: they eat ice cream, go to the zoo. Then his son becomes bolder and says that one thing he would like to do is go beat up a boy who bugs him at school. “OK, write it down,” Rhinehart says, and that is what the dice rolls. The boy thinks his father won’t make him go through with it, but his dad says: “Go ahead.” The boy goes to his friend’s place, hits him several times, and comes back to the house with his eyes shining and asks: “Where are the dice, Dad?”That makes Rhinehart stop and think: if his son so naturally adopts this way of being, it is because he is not yet completely warped by the absurd notion that it is good for children to develop a coherent character. What if they were brought up differently, giving pride of place to contradiction, multiplicity and relentless change? Luke seriously thinks of freeing his son from the dismal tyranny of the ego and making him the first man entirely subject to chance. Then his wife returns and discovers what has been going on. Not finding it funny in the least, she leaves Rhinehart and takes the children with her.Next, it is his profession that Rhinehart abandons, after disgracing himself (on the dice’s instructions) at an evening with the cream of New York psychoanalysts. With no family, work or personal ties, he is free to move from transgression to transgression. Eventually, the day comes when the dice pushes him to do things that he had not only never dared to do, but didn’t want to do, because they ran counter to his tastes, his desires, his whole personality. But that’s just it: the personality – the miserable, petty personality – is the enemy to be done away with, the conditioning that you have to free yourself from.Sooner or later, he could not avoid writing “murder” on his list of options. When the dice orders him to do it, Rhinehart is forced to draw up a list of six potential victims, in which he courageously includes his two children. Luckily for him, he is spared that particular ordeal: the dice simply demands that he kill one of his former patients.If you believe his autobiography, he went through with it, although certain commentators doubt it. What does seem certain is that having ruined his career, his family life and his reputation, Rhinehart was ready to become a prophet, and that is what he did. In these years when the most paradoxical therapies flourished from one side of the US to the other, a guru with a dice had every chance of attracting followers. So he establishes the Centers for Experiments in Totally Random Environments, where you enrol of your own free will but undertake not to leave until the experiment is over. In time, students are expected to commit to roleplays of varying durations: you list six personality types and for 10 minutes, an hour, a day, a week, a month, or a year, adopt the one that the dice decides.Some of the followers of dice therapy went insane. Others died or ended up in prison. Some, it seems, reached a state of nirvana. During their short existence, Rhinehart’s centres became as scandalous as Timothy Leary’s communities: a school of chaos posing as serious a threat to civilisation as communism or the satanism of Charles Manson, as the conservative newspapers had it. The end of the adventure is shrouded in obscurity. It is said that Rhinehart was arrested by the FBI, that he spent 20 years in a psychiatric hospital. Or that he died. Or that he never existed at all.Everything I have just told comes from a book, The Dice Man, published in the US in 1971 and translated into French the following year. I was 16 when I discovered it, as a terribly timid adolescent with long hair, an afghan jacket and little round glasses. For a while, I walked around with a dice in my pocket, counting on it to give me the self-confidence I lacked with girls. (Not that it worked too well.) The Dice Man is the kind of book that not only pleases readers but also gives them a set of rules for life: a manual for subversion.It was not clear whether the book was fiction or autobiography, but its author, Luke Rhinehart, had the same name as his hero and, like him, he was a psychiatrist. According to the back cover, he lived in Majorca – seemingly the ideal refuge for a prophet at the end of his tether, who has just managed to escape from his shipwrecked community of maniacs. The years passed, The Dice Man remained the object of a minor but persistent cult, and each time I met someone who had read it (almost always a pothead, and often a follower of the I Ching), the same questions came up: what was true in the book? Who was Luke Rhinehart? What had become of him?After The Dice Man came up in conversation a little while back, I started to wonder once again what had become of Luke Rhinehart. In an hour online, of course, I learned more about Rhinehart than I had in 30 years of idle conjecture.His real name is George Cockcroft, and though no longer young, he is alive. He has written other books, but none as successful as The Dice Man, which almost 50 years after it came out is still a cult classic. Dozens of sites are dedicated to it, and just as many legends circulate about it. Ten times it was almost adapted for the cinema, but mysteriously the project never came about. Communities of followers of the dice still exist all over the world. As for the mythical author, he lives as a recluse on a remote farm in upstate New York. One particular photo of him makes the rounds: it shows a sarcastic, gaunt face under a stetson. I imagine Luke Rhinehart as something like Carlos Castaneda, William Burroughs and Thomas Pynchon rolled into one: an icon of the most radical subversion, transformed into an invisible man. I decide that I must meet him.One detail should have warned me that my initial ideas were not quite right: my invisible man has his own website, through which I was able to contact him. He answered my message in less than an hour, with surprising good grace for a recluse. I wanted to come from France to interview him? What a good idea! When I filled him in on the reason for my visit, he told me that he hoped he was not going to disappoint me: on my search for Luke Rhinehart I was going to meet George Cockcroft, and George Cockcroft, in his own words, was an old fart. I took this warning as false modesty.For the past couple of weeks, I have been in contact with some followers of the dice on the internet, and on my way through New York I invite one to dinner. Ron is 30, introduces himself as a conceptual artist and urban pirate, and heads a community of dice people who meet every month for what, under all the new-age jargon, seems to be good old group sex, where the dice above all decides who will be on top, who on the bottom and so on. No such thing is planned for the days when I will be there, I learn a little to my regret, but the urban pirate appears impressed by my boldness: knocking on Luke Rhinehart’s door! Pulling on the tiger’s whiskers! That’s really venturing into the dark side of the Force. I answer that to judge by the author’s messages, he seems like a nice old guy.Ron looks at me pensively, with a touch of pity: “A nice old guy … Sure, why not? Maybe the dice ordered him to play that role for you. But don’t forget that a dice has six sides. He’s showing you one, you don’t know what’s behind the other five, or when he’ll decide to reveal them … ”The man waiting for me when I arrive in Hudson in upstate New York is wearing the same Stetson as he is in that photograph. He has the same jagged features, the same faded blue eyes and the same slightly sardonic smile. He is tall and has a bit of a slouch you could even find him sinister, but when I hold out my hand, he gives me a big hug, kisses me on both cheeks as if I were his son and introduces me to his wife, Ann, who is just as warm and welcoming as he is.We all pile into their old station wagon, and as we drive past the orchards and through the woods, I realise that this landscape reminds me of one of my favourite novels: Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton. My hosts are enchanted: it is one of their favourites as well, and George has often taught it to his students.To his students? He is not a psychiatrist, or a psychoanalyst?“Psychiatrist? Psychoanalyst?” George repeats, as surprised as if I had said cosmonaut. No, he was never a psychiatrist, he has been a college English teacher all his life.Really? But on the cover of his book …George shrugs as if to say, editors, journalists, you know, there is almost nothing they won’t write.From Hudson we drive for about an hour he handles the wheel with an abruptness that contrasts with his good humour and makes his wife laugh. It is moving to see how the two love each other, and when Ann tells me in passing that they have been married for 50 years, I am not surprised.They live in an old farmhouse with a yard that slopes down to a duck pond. They have three grown boys, two of whom live nearby. One is a carpenter and the other is a housepainter the third still lives at home. He is schizophrenic, Ann tells me matter-of-factly he is doing fine at the moment, but I shouldn’t worry if I hear him speaking a bit loudly in his room, which is right beside the guest room where I will be staying. (I invited myself for the weekend, but I get the feeling that if I wanted to settle in for a week or a month, it wouldn’t be a problem.)Ann serves us tea, and George and I take our mugs out on to the terrace for the interview. He has swapped his Stetson for a baseball cap, and I ask him to tell me about his life. He starts from the beginning.He was born in 1932 in Albany, just a few miles from where he now lives and where, in all likelihood, he will die. Semi-rural middle-class, hit hard by the Depression, in spite of which he looks back on a more or less happy childhood and youth. Good at maths, a bit of an egghead and not adventurous in the least, he reached 20 without having felt the slightest creative urge. At college he began studying psychology, but found it tedious and instead decided it was better to read novels.While working night shifts as an intern in a hospital on Long Island, he devoured Mark Twain, Herman Melville and the great 19th-century Russian writers. He started working on a novel that took place in a psychiatric hospital. The hero is a young man who has been interned because he thinks he is Jesus, and among the hospital staff is a doctor named Luke Rhinehart, who practises dice therapy. The dice was a quirk the young George picked up in college. He and his friends used it on Saturdays to decide what they were going to do that night. Sometimes, they dared each other to do stuff: hop around the block on one leg, ring a neighbour’s doorbell, nothing too mischievous. When I ask, hopefully, whether he pushed these experiences further as an adult, he shrugs his shoulders and smiles apologetically because he can tell that I would like something a little spicier.“No,” he admits. “All I asked the dice was, for example, if I’d had enough of working: do I stay at my desk for another hour? Or two hours? Or do I go for a walk right away?”“What are you talking about?” says Ann, who has come on to the terrace to offer us some blueberry crumble. “Don’t you remember at least one important decision that the dice made you take?”He laughs, so does she, and he tells me that he had noticed an attractive nurse at the hospital, but was shy and didn’t dare talk to her. The dice made him do it: he drove her home, took her to church, but the church was closed, so he invited her to play tennis. Of course, the attractive nurse was Ann.Ten years later they had three little boys, and George, who had become an English teacher, applied for a job at the American school in Mallorca. This expatriation is the big adventure of their lives. Although Mallorca in the 1960s was associated with psychedelia and wild living, George didn’t take drugs, was faithful to his wife, and mostly just hung around with other teachers like himself. Still, he didn’t completely escape the zeitgeist. He started to read books on psychoanalysis, antipsychiatry, oriental mysticism, Zen – all aspects of 1960s counterculture, whose grand idea was that we are conditioned, and that we must free ourselves from this conditioning. Influenced by this reading, he suddenly became aware of the revolutionary potential of something he had thought of as no more than a simple game, and had more or less given up since his adolescence. Although he had also long ago given up on the idea of writing books, he got fired up about what would become The Dice Man. He spent four years writing it, supported faithfully by his wife.Much to their surprise, an editor paid good money for the book, and the rights were sold to Paramount. Then The Dice Man started to live its erratic, unpredictable life: success in Europe but not in the US, regular new editions and, eventually, cult status. There were disappointments: for one obscure reason or another the film was never made, and none of his other books had the same success. But the rights from The Dice Man allowed them to buy this beautiful house, and to age with dignity – George writing, Ann painting, both of them caring for their son with schizophrenia.The day I visited was Mother’s Day, and the two other boys came over to celebrate it with their parents. They are good American kids: Budweiser drinkers, trout fishers, wearers of checkered shirts. Later, their brother came out of his room for a short while. All three told Ann she was “a terrific mom”. After dinner, we finished the evening at the house of one of their sons, also in the middle of the countryside. He has an outdoor jacuzzi, in which George and I continued to drink while looking up at the stars, with the result that I don’t quite remember how I made it back to my room.It is strange how much you can project on to a photograph. The one of Luke Rhinehart made me imagine a whole novel: a dangerous, sulphurous life filled with excesses, transgressions and ruptures. Bordellos in Mexico, communities of madmen in the Nevada desert, delirious, mind-expanding experiences. And this face, the same face with strong bones and eyes of steel, is in fact that of an adorable old man who is approaching the end of a sweet, comfortable life with his adorable wife, a man whose only departure from the norm was to have written this alarming book, and who in his old age must softly, gently explain to people who come to see him that you must not confuse it with him, and that he is simply a novelist.Really? But what did I know about the reality? I remembered the warning of Ron, the urban pirate. What you see, the adorable old man, is just one side of the dice. It is the side that the dice ordered him to show you, but at least five others are in reserve.At breakfast I could see that George was worried he had disappointed me. So he took me kayaking on a lake, and as our kayaks skimmed slowly over the calm water, he told me the stories of some of his disciples. What he was content merely to imagine, others did for real. Take the tycoon Richard Branson. He used to say that all of his choices in business and in life had been taken thanks to the dice, influenced by Luke Rhinehart.Then there was the British gonzo journalist Ben Marshall who, in the 1990s, took on an assignment in which he would follow Rhinehart’s example for three months: let all of your decisions be taken by the dice and write about what happens. The journalist took the assignment seriously enough, it seems, to trash his love life and his professional life, and to disappear without a trace for several months. “A funny guy, that Ben,” George tells me. “You can see him in Diceworld, a documentary made by an English TV channel in 1999.”I had never heard of this documentary and ask if George has a copy we can watch. All of a sudden he looks embarrassed. He says it is not great, and he is not sure he even has it. But I insist, and in no time we are sitting on the living room couch in front of the big TV and the film starts. It is true, it is not great. But it does show Marshall, who volunteered to gamble his life on the dice and who explains convincingly how he stopped before he went mad, because the dice can drive you mad.And lo and behold, whom do we see next? His inspiration, our friend George – or rather, our friend Luke, as he was 15 years ago: the Stetson, the gaunt face, the steely eyes, handsome, but not at all like the doting grandfather I know. In a low, insinuating, hypnotic voice, he says into the camera: “You lead a dull life, a life of slavery, a life that doesn’t satisfy you, but there’s a way to get out of it. This way is the dice. Let yourself go, submit yourself to it, and you’ll see, your life will change, you’ll become someone you can’t even imagine.”Saying this, he looks like a televangelist, the head of a sect filmed just before his followers commit mass suicide. He is frightening. I turn to look at the person beside me on the couch, the nice pensioner in slippers holding his mug of herbal tea. He gives me an embarrassed, apologetic smile and says that the Luke in this film is not him. He, George, wasn’t so keen on it, but the director insisted.Ann, who can hear us from the kitchen, laughs gaily. “You’re watching the film where you play the spook?”He laughs, too, beside me on the couch. Nevertheless, when I see him on the screen, I find him awfully convincing.I met other followers of the dice over the internet: one in Salt Lake City, one in Munich, one in Madrid. All men. In Madrid, Oscar Cuadrado, who came to meet me at the airport, is young, a bit pudgy, and nice. On the way to his place in his 4×4, he made what was by now a familiar joke: “I may look nice, but you never know what the dice’s got in store for tonight: maybe I’m a serial killer and you’ll find yourself chained to my basement wall.”He lives in a stylish house in the suburbs, together with his wife and daughter, and without further ado we sat at a lawn table and consulted the dice: do we have a drink right away, or do we wait until we have done the interview? Three sides for a drink, three against: we could just as well have tossed a coin. The answer: right away. Now, do we drink beer, table wine or the bottle that Cuadrado’s saving for his daughter’s 18th birthday? Two sides for the beer, three for the table wine, and just one for the special bottle, because although he would open it willingly – you don’t refuse the dice – still … Finally, it is over a glass of table wine that he explains to me how he uses the dice.Like everyone, Cuadrado has heard of people who have ruined their lives by setting extreme conditions such as going halfway around the world and never coming back, having sex with animals or stabbing someone at random in a crowded train station in India. Stories like that circulate on all sites dedicated to the dice – including the one he has been managing for the past 10 years – but they don’t interest him. He recommends using it in a way that makes life more fun and surprising.He has three rules. The first is to always obey. But obeying the dice is ultimately obeying yourself, since you set your options. Hence the second rule, concerning the decisive moment when you list the six possibilities. You have to examine yourself and try to find out what you want. It is a spiritual exercise, aimed both at getting to know yourself and getting a better grasp of the infinite possibilities that reality offers. The options you select have to be pleasant, but at least one – the third – has to be something you would not normally do. It has to make you overcome resistance and break with habit. When you throw the dice, your desire has to be tinged with fear.Ever since he discovered the Spanish translation of The Dice Man when he was 17, this sort of small challenge has been second nature to Cuadrado. Like his father, he is a tax lawyer, but thanks to the dice he has also become a wine importer, a webmaster, a Go teacher, a fan of Iceland and the publisher of the Mauritian poet Malcolm de Chazal. How’s that? Well, first he thought it would be good to get to know a foreign country. Six continents, six options. The dice fell on Europe, then, narrowing the choices, on Iceland. Fine. Now, how should he visit it: on foot, by car, hitchhiking, by boat, by bike or on a skateboard? It landed on bike. The only problem: he had never ridden one before. So he learned, toured Iceland by bike, and even went back with the young woman who would become his wife. On this trip the dice got him to make the proposal, which was accepted.For their honeymoon, the young couple travelled to Mauritius – a present from his parents-in-law, not the dice. But once there, Cuadrado made up for it. He looked around for something to read, an author with something to do with Mauritius. The dice chose the poet Malcolm de Chazal. Bingo: he fell completely in love with De Chazal, a creole surrealist whom the artist André Breton was crazy about. Seeing that De Chazal had not been translated into Spanish, when Cuadrado got back from his honeymoon he founded a publishing company to change that. He knew nothing about publishing, no more than he had known about bike riding. But when he pulls the books from his shelf, I can understand why he is proud: they are magnificent. He sums up: “It’s through Luke that I discovered Malcolm, and now it’s thanks to him that I’ve met you. Funny, isn’t it?”It is our pleasure to inform you that Luke Rhinehart is dead.Luke didn’t fear death, although he confessed to being a bit nervous. Death to him was just another one of life’s unknowns, like travelling to a new land, starting a new book, trusting a new friend. Luke liked to laugh at death, but then again he liked to laugh at everything. He felt confident that death wasn’t all it was cracked up to be. He promised to report back as soon as he could and let us know what he had found. He was confident we would all get a good chuckle out of it. However, at this point we still haven’t heard word.Some of you have asked about Luke’s last days. They were no different from days from any week over the last several decades. People who came to see him on the basis of his books were sometimes discouraged to discover how attached he was to his habits. Even when he threw the dice, it was always to do more or less the same things.“It’s not rolling along in the same old patterns that is bad in itself,” he said, “but rather if you’re enjoying the rolling. If you’re comfortable in the selves you’re rolling along with, then roll on. Most people aren’t. They don’t like who they are. It’s with them in mind that I wrote all those things about the dice. But I’m fine as I am.”Luke’s wife, Ann, was with him to the end.When I received this email, I was surprised, then sad, then moved. Since I had their number, I called Ann to express my condolences. When she picked up the phone, she was as cordial as ever, but she sounded a bit hurried and said she would pass me on to George. I stuttered something about the email I had just received, and she answered like someone who was used to this sort of little misunderstanding: “Oh, the email! Of course … But don’t worry: it’s not George who died, it’s Luke.”When he got on the line, George confirmed: “Yeah, I was getting a little tired of Luke. I’m getting older, you know. I still love life: seeing what the weather’s like when I look out the window in the morning, doing the gardening, making love, going kayaking, but I am less interested in my career, and my career was basically Luke. I wrote that letter for Ann to send it to my correspondents when I died. I kept it in a file for two years, and one day I decided to send it.”I asked him two more questions. The first: before sending this email, did he throw the dice?“Oh, no, that didn’t even occur to me,” said George. “The dice can be useful when you don’t know what you want. But when you know, what use is it?”Second question: how did his correspondents take the news?He gave his mischievous little laugh. “Well, a few thought it was in bad taste. Aside from them, some thought: ‘That’s George!’ And others: ‘That’s Luke!’“And you, what do you think?”This is an abridged version of “In Search of the Dice Man”, an essay from a new collection 97,196 Words by Emmanuel Carrère, published by Bodley Head on 14 November and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dc296d8498f7b83abab9bdafc30fb59e52e5544/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca473551efac5b3b0ad41f4916712a50","title":"how a guardian story led to a landmark case against big tobacco","story":"In June 2018 Sarah Boseley wrote about child labour in the tobacco fields of Malawi.

It’s a disgrace.“We’ll extend the amount of time a new mother can spend with her newborn by extending statutory maternity pay to 12 months, so that all mothers can afford to spend those vital early months with their baby.“Labour will deliver a workplace revolution to bring about a step change in how women are treated at work. We’ll boost pay, increase flexibility and strengthen protections against harassment and discrimination. After years of our concerns being ignored, it’s time for real change.”The plans represent part of a wider package from Labour to improve conditions for workers. Another major plank would be having union equality representatives elected by workers to promote equality, ersity and inclusion. They would make sure trade union equality representatives have legal rights to time off, training and facilities to perform their duties.On the gender pay gap, the party – if elected to govern – plans to amend regulations so that by 2020 the threshold would be lowered to workplaces with more than 50 employees, down from the current level of more than 250 employees."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e8032782b9858287394ca75e5804c0923c313c0/64_0_3199_1919/master/3199.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=303702f9c8cb3a023162e6cb468a13dd","title":"pm gives cast iron pledge to refuse second scottish independence vote","story":"Boris Johnson described Nicola Sturgeon and Jeremy Corbyn as ‘yoke-mates of destruction’Boris Johnson has made a “cast iron” pledge that he will not grant Nicola Sturgeon the powers she needs to hold a second independence referendum, regardless of whether the Scottish National party (SNP) wins a majority of Scottish seats in December’s general election or if they win a pro-independence majority in the Holyrood elections of 2021.Describing Nicola Sturgeon and Jeremy Corbyn as “yoke-mates of destruction” in terms of the future stability of the union, he told reporters: “It’s perfectly obvious that Jeremy Corbyn is going to rely on the SNP to get him into power and to do that he’s done a shady deal to have a second referendum.”On Wednesday, the leader of Scottish Labour, Richard Leonard, categorically ruled out any form of electoral deal with the SNP, after Johnson warned against making 2020 the “year of two referendums” and Sturgeon told voters that demand for a second vote on independence would become “irresistible” if her party were to win the election in Scotland.Johnson’s visit comes on the second day of the election campaign, which has already been overshadowed for the Conservatives by a series of damaging blunders, after his ally, Jacob Rees-Mogg, suggested that victims of the Grenfell Tower fire lacked common sense and Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, resigned over his knowledge of a former aide’s role in allegedly sabotaging a rape trial.Johnson visited the Roseisle distillery, near Elgin, in Moray, accompanied by the local Scottish Conservative candidate, Douglas Ross, who won the seat from the SNP’s former Westminster leader Angus Robertson in 2017.Johnson spent little over an hour touring the rural distillery in a strictly managed visit during which he had no contact with the public. He returned immediately to RAF Lossiemouth, and from there travelled to Northern Ireland where he visited a Tayto crisp factory in Tandragee, County Armagh, to round off his day of campaigning.Johnson was asked why his visits to Scotland since his election to the Tory leadership had all taken place in secure locations away from the general public, such as the Faslane nuclear base.He insisted: “I’ve met many, many Scottish voters in the course of my time as prime minister and look forward to meeting many more.”Pressed on where and when these meetings had occurred, he repeated that he had met Scottish voters “loads of times”. When the  suggested that this was not the case, Johnson replied: “You’re a voter, aren’t you?”Asked about his first meeting with Nicola Sturgeon after he became prime minster, when he was booed by crowds outside the first minister’s official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh, he said: “I’m always very pleased to come to Scotland.”Johnson also claimed he had overruled advice in order to hold the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow next year. “I overruled advice from others and I decided to put the COP26 climate change summit not in London … but in Glasgow, because it’s a fantastic place and it gives us the chance to show off Glasgow to the rest of the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3152ac117cd007ce49ce06c1fa3261d1b57b98fa/0_0_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b62e1eac5f6bfcce0902ccd1094cc52","title":"spend spend spend javid and mcdonnell vie for first dibs same policy","story":"Austerity appears to melt away as Tories and Labour proffer the Midas touch with unfrozen coffersLet a hundred horse radishes bloom. As Jeremy Corbyn almost wrote to Tom Watson. The good times are here again. Austerity? What austerity? The absence of pain would almost make the agony worthwhile. Almost.Somewhat later than billed due to cancelled trains in the north-west – whenever the government finds out who has been in charge of infrastructure spending there’s going to be hell to pay – Sajid Javid laid out his plans for the economy at a speech in an aviation park just outside Manchester.And what riches he had seen! Treasures the like of which few chancellors had ever laid their hands on.The old fiscal rules were shredded. The new fiscal rules were that there were no fiscal rules. He could borrow what he liked. He could spend what he liked. In fact, with negative interest rates the more he borrowed, the better off the country would be. It would be mad not to take out as many loans as possible. Even those with PPI.But he would be prudent. So he would only be spending £100bn for the time being. The same £100bn the Conservatives had condemned as reckless when Labour had made a similar promise during the 2017 election.Javid had more good news. The latest report from the Office for Budget Responsibility had mysteriously gone awol at the last minute, so no one need worry that the government’s finances might be in worse shape than many had feared.And the great thing about Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal was that it was better for the economy than no deal at all, though obviously far worse than Theresa May’s deal or staying in the EU. So everyone should just sit back, pretend the last nine years had never happened and spend, spend, spend.Over at the Invisible Wind Factory – aka a chilly converted warehouse – in Liverpool, John McDonnell had seen Javid’s £100bn and raised him a further £250bn. To even think of less than that made the chancellor a climate-change denier and a scrooge. Someone intent on grinding the economy to a standstill. Though for someone who was planning on the biggest round of public spending since the 1970s, he didn’t sound very enthusiastic about it. Rather his voice retained its usual dry, deadpan, delivery. Maybe it was his way of apologising for having to be so cautious and withhold the other £500bn he really wanted to spend.McDonnell laid out his proposals with the quiet confidence of a man who knows he’s really in charge. Jeremy Corbyn might be the frontman who did all the audience participation hysteria, but he was the real brains behind the operation. People had dismissed him as a madman, but he’d turned out to be a prophet all along.After all, he’d effectively written the current Tory manifesto – two years ago: houses and railways would be built, the Treasury would have a branch office in the north. Things that hadn’t yet been thought of would also be invested in. There were no limits to what would be possible.Labour’s Lucy Powell, one of many former MPs seeking re-election, was then brought out to act as compere for the Q\u0026ampA session with the media. She sounded almost apologetic as she reminded the audience not to boo journalists for asking difficult questions. “We’re very proud of our policies,” she said, “and we want them to be scrutinised.” Though maybe not too closely.Was McDonnell worried that he’d be labelled a spendthrift Marxist? Not at all, he said. Everything had been fully costed. Not least by the Tories who had adopted the gloves-off principle of unlimited public-sector borrowing. Besides, he was just following in the well-trodden socialist footsteps of other Labour chancellors, such as Gordon Brown. Now this was a first, because no one could previously remember the shadow chancellor having a good word to say about Brown.It’s amazing the difference a couple of years and some pastel M\u0026ampS cardies can make. In 2017, McDonnell was the country’s evil Trot, the Bond villain whose eyes never smiled. Now he’s more of a cuddly afternoon TV chat-show host. The mask only slipped slightly when he was asked about the former Labour MP Ian Austin urging Labour supporters to vote for Boris – “he’s always been a Tory”, he snapped – but then he regained his composure and asked everyone to thank the media for their questions.The audience and Jeremy duly gave a desultory round of applause. McDonnell might be Mr Nice Guy now, but he’s still not someone you would want to cross.John Crace’s new book, Decline and Fail: Read in Case of Political Apocalypse, is published by  Faber.

While its long forearms, curved fingers and powerful, grasping thumbs were hallmarks of life spent dangling from branches, the hips, knees and feet were more human-like and better suited to walking upright, the scientists said.“It was astonishing for us to realise during the process of research how similar certain bones were to humans, as opposed to great apes,” said Madelaine Böhme, who led the study at the University of Tübingen. The fossils, which include remains from two females, a male and a juvenile, were excavated between 2015 and 2018.According to Böhme, the findings suggest that our upright posture can be traced to a common ancestor of humans and great apes that lived in Europe rather than Africa. When D guggenmosi was alive, Bavaria was far hotter than it is today, and streams bordered by gallery forests meandered through the region.The clay pit haul of fossils included teeth, pieces of jaw and spine, and a big toe that would have been handy for grasping tree branches. Arguably the most important fossils were a forearm and shin bone, which informed the scientists’ speculation about how the ape moved around.The most complete skeleton, with 21 bones, was thought to belong to a male that stood a metre high and weighed about 30kg. He had a broad chest and the curved, S-shaped spine seen in humans.Measurements of the teeth placed the ape in an extinct group called the dryopithecins, which lived in Europe in the middle to late Miocene, an epoch that lasted from about 23m years ago to five million years ago. Some researchers believe dryopithecins were the ancestors of the ancient African apes who ultimately gave rise to great apes more generally, including the gorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos and humans.Writing in the journal Nature, the scientists make the case for danuvius employing what they call “extended limb clambering” to get around. Rather than swinging from branches or walking cautiously on branches, extended limb clambering uses both arms and legs equally. “The emerging picture of its locomotion is different from any known living creature,” said Böhme.Tracy Kivell, at the University of Kent, said the fossils were impressive. In an accompanying article, she wrote: “Together, the mosaic features of D guggenmosi arguably provide the best model yet of what a common ancestor of humans and African apes might have looked like. It offers something for everyone: the forelimbs suited to life in the trees that all living apes, including humans, still have, and lower limbs suited to extended postures like those used by orangutans during bipedalism in the trees.”“Danuvius shows skeletal adaptations to a form of bipedalism that is previously unknown and shows that bipedalism evolved much earlier than we previously thought,” Kivell said. “Danuvius is not a fossil hominin, but it does help inform how humans may have evolved.”Some of the most compelling evidence for upright walking in human ancestors comes from Ardipithecus ramidus, a female skeleton dating back 4.4m years that was found in Ethiopia. Ardi, who stood about a metre tall, may not have been the most accomplished of walkers, but much of her skeleton shows adaptations to walking on two feet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98929a6fc20cb186015d31c6d8d81e635b230f20/0_70_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f156d062408add07a575201cd496f8d5","title":"jamie chadwick lewis hamilton f1","story":"• Briton is development driver for Williams F1 team• Chadwick will look to earn qualifying points in W SeriesJamie Chadwick has expressed her admiration for Lewis Hamilton but admitted that her aim of reaching Formula One will be far from easy. The British driver won the inaugural women-only W Series in August and is now a development driver for the Williams F1 team.The 21-year-old won the W Series with a dominant performance including two wins and three podium places in six races. She will defend her title next year when the series expands to eight races and will award FIA super licence points, which are required to compete in F1.Chadwick said that Hamilton, Britain’s most successful driver, was an inspiration. “I have a huge amount of respect for him,” she said. “He is a six-time world champion and an unbelievable one. If I can emulate even a tiny amount of that, it has to be something to aim for.”Chadwick has already enjoyed considerable success. She was the first woman and the youngest driver to win the British GT championship and last year won the Asian MRF Challenge.A woman has not raced in Formula One since Lella Lombardi 43 years ago and Chadwick’s role with Williams, which includes her working on the team’s F1 simulator, has been valuable but also instructive in illustrating the scale of the challenge that lays ahead.The W Series made a significant impact this year, successfully bringing female drivers the exposure and track time that many would otherwise have been denied. Chadwick has tested an F3 Euroformula car recently, is considering competing in the championship and will also compete in the electric Extreme E series set to take place in 2021. Liechtenstein’s Fabienne Wohlwend has become a household name in her home country and has enough backing to race full-time next year. Chadwick believes the W Series is making the right steps as it looks to build on its achievements.“It’s so exciting to see a series not following the norm and changing, adapting and learning, it’s an exciting time,” she said. “The way it has changed my life is that is has not just appealed to the motorsport audiences. It’s grabbed the attention of women’s sport in general. I have been on shortlists for awards that no one in motorsport would have got previously their name in.”Next season the W Series will include two new fixtures in Russia and Sweden. The opening round will be held on the new purpose-built circuit at St Petersburg on 29‑30 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd1ec19cbcf06c9443f0383cf7b9a837c5f86408/0_485_4459_2676/master/4459.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79a5f205907fff03b30e4eafe3b6596a","title":"reputation review musical plagiarism alick glass","story":"The Other Palace, London This new musical by Alick Glass carries its fight against 30s movie plagiarism with pleasant songs, but lacks the showbiz sparkle to land a killer punchThis theatre’s downstairs studio is the ideal space in which to try out new musicals but Reputation, with a score and lyrics by Alick Glass, feels more like a throwback than a thrust forward. Set in the 1930s, it deals with a case of showbiz plagiarism. The songs are harmlessly pleasant, but never take you by surprise.The story, jointly devised by Glass and his daughter, Suzanne, concerns an aspiring writer, Michelle, studying at a language school in Paris. Answering an ad in Variety, she naively sends a novel she has written to a script agency only to find, after her work has been rejected, that it has become the basis for a movie starring Clark Gable and Joan Crawford. Understandably she sues the Hollywood shark who devours other people’s ideas and in the process falls in love with her lawyer.Given that the thieving villain is called Freddie Larceny and the lawyer Mr Bright, subtlety is not exactly the name of the game. This is also the kind of show where the dancing chorus hymn “Paree” and where we are told of New York that “the bright lights and the Empire State tower over me”. Glass can turn a tune but his lyrics lack tang and bite: it is somewhat surprising, after Michelle has sung a bland number announcing “sweet innocence of youth doesn’t linger”, to hear her praised by the court arbitrator for her verbal dexterity.The best song, Raindrops, nicely delivered by Priscille Grace, evokes a world of sad ballads. Warren Wills works tirelessly as both musical and stage director and the performances are perfectly decent. Jeremy Secomb as the bubonic plagiarist, Maddy Banks as the wide-eyed writer and Ed Wade as her heart-struck counsel do all that is asked. But, in portraying a vanished period, the show never achieves the exuberant pastiche of The Boy Friend and, although it is unusual to have a musical co-created by a father and daughter, two Glasses don’t in the end make a spectacle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff2033e5926142120943523fc99923a290319d61/344_38_733_440/master/733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53a8e26bcc5411e43ba1a08397a8bc33","title":"britbox uk networks plan to tackle netflix amazon and apple tv","story":"‘Best of British’ streaming venture will exclude series such as Till Death Us Do PartBritBox, the new “best of British” streaming joint venture from the BBC and ITV, will not include classic homegrown series that are deemed to be inappropriate for modern audiences.The new £5.99-a-month service, which will also offer shows from Channel 4 and Channel 5, is aiming to compete with Netflix and Amazon Prime Video by positioning itself as the home of the widest library of British shows, old and new.However, bosses have said a range of classic shows, such as the BBC’s Till Death Us Do Part and ITV’s Love Thy Neighbour, will not appear on the service because of content deemed racist or otherwise unacceptable.Sakaan confirmed that Till Death Us Do Part, featuring the bigoted character Alf Garnett, which first aired on BBC1 in 1965, and ITV’s 1970s series Love Thy Neighbour, a sitcom about a West Indian couple who move next door to a white English couple, will not appear on the service. It Ain’t Half Hot Mum, the BBC comedy about a military band in India during the second world war, will also be absent.There are numerous inidual episodes of some beloved shows that will appear on BritBox – including the BBC’s Only Fools and Horses and Fawlty Towers – which could be deemed inappropriate for modern viewing. However, it is understood that no Fawlty Towers episodes will be cut from the service, although they will run with warnings about offensive language. “We’ve carefully selected a wide range of the very best in British programming which will appeal to viewers in 2019,” an ITV spokeswoman said. ITV’s compliance team is voluntarily vetting BritBox shows to make sure they adhere to the broadcasting code, which applies to the broadcaster’s TV channels and is governed by Ofcom, the media and communications watchdog. The broadcasting code includes strict rules relating to harm and offence and generally accepted standards, including inappropriate, explicit and violent content.However, BritBox is officially subject to a much less stringent set of rules than those of traditional TV channels such as ITV and the BBC. BritBox offers a range of shows, from Downton Abbey, Gavin \u0026amp Stacey and Wolf Hall to Broadchurch, Brideshead Revisited, Blackadder and more than 600 episodes of Doctor Who.BritBox is a late arrival in an increasingly crowded streaming market. Earlier this month Apple launched its new streaming service, undercutting all rivals at just £4.99 a month, or free for a year to buyers of new Apple devices.Netflix is the most popular subscription streamer in the UK, having 11 million subscribers, but it is becoming increasingly expensive, with its most popular package priced at £8.99 a month. Prime Video is estimated to have 8.6 million UK subscribers, with Sky’s Now TV the third most popular service with about 1.75 million.Sakaan took a swipe at Netflix, which has rung up debt and liabilities of more than $30bn (£23bn) in the process of building the world’s largest streaming service with more than 150m subscribers.She said there was a gap in the market because UK audiences often felt “lost” using other streaming services dominated by US content. “In BritBox you are immediately in a world populated by people and faces and places you know. The scale of British content available eclipses what is on any other streaming service.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d2cdfe682b38805fc65a2744cf0c8855d7da254/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5c9ca89d1e58d9968aa517f79e26084","title":"watchmen damon lindelof riddle me not why im sick of tv shows that revel in wtf storytelling","story":"As compelling as Watchmen might be, it’s yet another show that relies on a mystery box form of storytelling that can prove frustratingThe most recent episode of Watchmen ended, as it so often does, on a puzzling note. FBI agent Laurie Blake (Jean Smart) has adjourned to her hotel room for a moment of personal time, which will be facilitated by the contents of her briefcase. She cracks it open to reveal a metallic ice-blue dildo with attachable testicles, so shiny and girthy that it looks more like a relay runner’s baton than a sex toy. Those familiar with Alan Moore’s source material will make the connection to Laurie’s ex Dr Manhattan and his robin’s-egg genitals, but even viewers in the know will be stricken by bafflement. Why does she carry this with her in a bulky storage case at all times? What of the minimalist design, which showrunner Damon Lindelof likened to a Jeff Koons sculpture in one of the instant-postmortem interviews that run every Sunday night? And why is the thing so gosh-darned big?Questions like these serve as the currency for Lindelof’s sequelreinterpretation of the landmark graphic novel, a show that traffics in what-just-happened confusion on a week-to-week basis. Some of its many riddles – the enduring mystery of why one law enforcement official wears an oversized panda head, for instance, or the reason that a cloned manservant gives his master a horseshoe with which to eat a piece of cake – seem unlikely to ever be solved. Others, such as the party or parties operating the flying saucer that appeared out of nowhere to magnet-airlift one character’s car away as if it was a crane-game prize, must be clarified for the plot to move forward. But telling one from the other is all ultimately guesswork, with the audience left in the dark, right where Lindelof wants them.We don’t even know what we’re supposed to know, and that’s where the bother lies. Lindelof thrives on all things confounding, the one point his previous works Lost and The Leftovers made abundantly clear. When considered after the fact of their broadcast runs as a discrete, closed-off whole, the series making up his body of work constitute some of the most entrancingly strange television in the medium’s history. But when experienced on a week-to-week basis, there’s a mild yet consistent frustration all too familiar to those with fresh memories of mid-00s genre projects like Lost and its lesser kindred Heroes. The Lindelofian element gives the impression that this perfectly intelligent, worthy show feels the need to trick its audience into tuning in week after week.To put it in Rumsfeldian terms, most TV shows operate within the unknown known, establishing a clearcut quantity of suspense to be resolved over the course of a season or series: who will win the game of thrones, who will succeed as CEO of Waystar Royco, who will challenge Tony Soprano’s mafia supremacy, etc. Lindelof descends into the unknown unknown, generating drama by showing viewers complete non sequiturs without the information required to make sense of them. Even Breaking Bad, and its decontextualized in-medias-res cold opens, isolated its floating eyeballs and destroyed pools from the main narrative. (And that still felt like a cheap hook for an already-gripping show to lean on.) If a showrunner’s not mindful about tethering their show to some foundation of comprehensibility, they end up with something in the spacey universe of Legion, drowning in weirdness for its own sake.To an extent, Lindelof is at a disadvantage of medium. Films can afford to adopt this modus operandi by the end of a self-contained unit of time ning two hours or so, the viewer will have received all the textual clues required to understand the work, or barring that, to gin up their own interpretation. Watchmen dares its viewership to solve its puzzles, but only gives them a handful of the pieces per week. Ironically enough, at a time when everyone seems to be running for the hills of streaming, the one series begging to be binged instead props up HBO’s programming schedule.Watchmen has so much going for it, from the immersive detail of its speculative-fiction America to its thorny meditations on the politics of law enforcement. It has more profound quandaries to offer than “what’s going on here?” and “what’ll happen next?” In the same episode containing the unconventional marital aid, Laurie stops for a chat with an old acquaintance and tells him a “brick joke”, a form of humor in which one set-up’s punchline doesn’t come until the end of a second premise. The gag works by delaying the payoff, a manipulation of tension that relies on structure to achieve its effect. For a joke that takes all of a minute to tell, this technique works a treat. But week after week spent waiting start to wear on the patience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf49581e29bfd421a0c15c90f717a90ef86df735/0_249_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ac055994801789ece26cd4cda44f4dc","title":"michael bloomberg 2020 election campaign","story":"Former New York mayor fears current Democratic candidates are not equipped to defeat Trump, adviser saysMichael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, is opening the door to a possible 2020 presidential campaign.Bloomberg announced earlier this year that he would not seek the Democratic nomination.But in a statement on Thursday afternoon, his political adviser Howard Wolfson said that Bloomberg was worried that the current crop of Democratic presidential candidates was “not well positioned” to defeat Donald Trump.A Bloomberg adviser said the former mayor had not made a final decision on whether to run.But he is expected to file to get on the ballot in Alabama’s Democratic presidential primary. The Alabama primary takes place on 3 March.Alabama has an early filing deadline and is among the states that vote on so-called Super Tuesday, the nickname for the large number of state contests held that day in the process to choose the Democratic party nominee to challenge Trump for the White House next November.He could file the necessary paperwork as early as this week, the New York Times reported.The entry of Bloomberg into the crowded Democratic field would be a huge disrupting influence and as a centrist and former Republican, an older billionaire with a political track record who, unusually, served three terms as mayor of New York City, he could be a huge threat to current frontrunner Joe Biden.The 77-year-old co-founded his eponymous financial information and media company Bloomberg in 1981 and is now worth an estimated $52bn, according to Forbes magazine, making him the ninth-richest person in the US and the 14th in the world.He studied at Johns Hopkins University and Harvard and joined the financial industry at Salomon Brothers in 1966.Bloomberg served as mayor of New York for 12 years and one of his best-known early actions was to ban smoking in bars in the city in 2003. He later became a strong advocate of gun control and in 2006 co-founded a campaign group against illegal firearms that drew the support of 1,000 mayors across the US. The group has since evolved into an organization called Everytown for Gun Safety.But he was also something of a isive figure, especially economically, in New York, seen by critics as a relentless gentrifier who encouraged and incentivized countless huge development projects across the city while affordable housing became more scarce. Tourism to the city soared while he was in office and projects such as the popular High Line park appeared alongside shiny new skyscrapers.Social media broke out the “Ok Bloomer” jokes on Thursday afternoon, a take on the popular Gen Z retort to anyone perceived to be a patronizing older person: “Ok Boomer”.He won more respect than affection among New Yorkers – only four mayors have served three terms. He was business-minded and clearly hugely successful in that arena. He was even-keeled and very well-connected, though not especially charismatic.But any prospect of Bloomberg entering the race will probably send shockwaves through the campaigns of the remaining moderate candidates, who will be hoping to maintain momentum through the November and December debates and contests in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.And despite his strong establishment political connections and solid track record, it is far from clear whether a Bloomberg candidacy would be welcomed by the Democratic party establishment.Grassroots support could be hard to build outside of the urban better-off and white suburbs. Bloomberg’s preference for police stop-and-frisk policies in New York was hugely unpopular with many liberals and in majority black neighborhoods, where it was persistent and sharply criticized as biased."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eed4252f79d359a6cfc0ee35391c4e2e1c36e4fe/0_0_2095_1257/master/2095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9790814a5db4363d6227369104077213","title":"glenn greenwald brazil augusto nunes radio show","story":"Greenwald has faced backlash from far right after series of articles damaging to Jair Bolsonaro’s governmentBrazil’s bitterly ided politics reached a new low on Thursday, when a rightwing columnist smacked the US journalist Glenn Greenwald in the face on a live radio program.Greenwald and Augusto Nunes are prominent figures on opposite ends of the political spectrum, but Thursday’s physical violence – which was being livestreamed – left Brazilians stunned.Greenwald has become a central figure in Brazilian politics after publishing a string of articles challenging the legitimacy of the country’s largest-ever corruption investigation.His reporting – based on a trove of leaked mobile phone messages – has been particularly damaging for the government of Jair Bolsonaro, making Greenwald a hate figure for those on Brazil’s far right, who have accused him of illegal hacking.The altercation came when the two men appeared on a program for the Jovem Pan radio station on Thursday.Nunes, a well-known columnist for Veja magazine, had previously suggested that a family judge should look into taking away Greenwald’s adopted children.Referring to Nunes’s comments, Greenwald said: “What he did was the ugliest, dirtiest thing I have seen in my career as a journalist.”Nunes responded that he was merely asking who took care of Greenwald’s children while his husband – the congressman David Miranda – was in the capital and the journalist was “spending all his time dealing with stolen material”.Greenwald accused Nunes of being a coward, prompting Nunes to take a swing at Greenwald. The two started lashing out at each other before they were pulled apart by station staff.Ciro Gomes, a leftwing politician who ran for president in 2018, called Nunes “vermin” and a “lowlife”.Nunes was “destroying values, committing slander, aggression, throwing insults and defending the worst values of the corrupt right wing”, he said in a video posted to social media.Two of Bolsonaro’s son’s expressed support for Nunes. Eduardo Bolsonaro, a congressman, tweeted that Nunes had acted “in legitimate defense of his honor”.“No one is required to be violated constantly with distortions of their words, be insulted to their face and accept it. Augusto Nunes didn’t have another option. He reacted the way any normal person with blood in their veins would have done,” Bolsonaro tweeted.Greenwald later posted a video to social media saying that Nunes’s attack was homophobic and dangerous.“Millions of Brazilians, and people all over the world … also have children and both parents work because of financial necessity or because they want to, but … he only says this about us,” he said.“This use of physical force and violence in the political debate is very serious. Now we are seeing … that Bolsonaro’s movement … is applauding, supporting his use of physical violence in the political debate.”Greenwald won a Pulitzer prize for leading the ’s reporting on National Security Agency (NSA) spying revealed by Edward Snowden before co-founding the Intercept website in 2014.

It will open to the public on Monday as part of celebrations to mark 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall.It is the first time one of the 75 escape tunnels built during the ision of Germany has been excavated. A specially constructed 30-metre-long walkway offers visitors views into the depths of the tunnel’s narrow, rugged lime-mud walls, which now have protected status.Poignantly, the tunnel – 110 metres long, 9 metres deep and built from west to east over two months in the winter of 1970-71 – was never used. Officers from the Stasi, or East German secret police, who had covertly observed its construction for weeks, using ultrasound monitors to detect its route, seized the tunnellers just as they were nearing completion on the communist side, with just three metres left to dig. Stasi reports indicate the pleasure the officers took in allowing the men to continue their back-breaking work in damp, dark conditions, knowing they were about to thwart their efforts.Many of the 17-strong team ended up being interrogated or imprisoned and the Stasi ordered the tunnel to be filled.“It was gut-wrenching when it failed,” recalled Ulrich Pfeifer, a construction engineer who helped lead the project. “Those of us involved were hugely angry, depressed and sank into ourselves, wallowing in alcohol for a while.”At the same time, he said, the very action of building the tunnel had acted as a cathartic process for those involved.“You could either be passive against that shit regime, or stand up to it by being active. It was a good way of releasing anger towards this illegitimate state which chose to lock in its citizens, of fighting against the sense of powerlessness,” said Pfeifer, who was a student who had fled to the west after the building of the Berlin Wall, in 1961.The tunnel began in the cellar of Brunnen Strasse 137, a corner house in West Berlin that was due to be demolished. The goal had been to reach the cellar of Brunnen Strasse 142, the second building after the border in East Berlin.Pfeifer said the builders of the tunnel had learned from the mistakes of previous tunnel projects about the merits of building both deeper – to prevent water buildup which caused the lime mud to disintegrate – and at an angle - to ease the removal of the rubble.“We’d measure how far we’d got every five to six days so that we could ensure we’d come out where we’d originally planned to,” he said.The Berlin Unterwelten (Berlin Underworlds) association, which has specialised in offering tours of subterranean Berlin since 1997, was instrumental in excavating the tunnel, raising €300,000 for the project. Hundreds of volunteers spent three years removing the earth with shovels and caulking hammers in often precarious conditions.The head of the association, Dietmar Arnold, said the tunnel had been christened Hasso Herschel after the now legendary Fluchthelfer, or escape agent, responsible for helping around 1,000 people to flee the German Democratic Republic. Herschel was behind the brewery tunnel as well as many successful escape plots, including the notorious Tunnel 29, a mission in which 29 people were rescued, which inspired a film and more recently a popular BBC podcast.Escapes beneath the Berlin Wall initially took place through the sewerage system, until the authorities blocked the routes.Most of the 75 tunnels failed, Pfeifer said. “The whole tunnel building enterprise was not particularly successful – it was a huge amount of work at considerable risk to our lives. But what else could we do? You hardly need to question our motivation for doing it, to rescue friends and family.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88e6c9adf8b1d6f10a0b29201b50f3c4f87b216d/0_129_1551_930/master/1551.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a0999367925b68e37ddbbc03cc27538","title":"sandra orangutan florida argentina buenos aires","story":"Judge’s landmark 2015 ruling declared Sandra, who was born in Germany and spent 25 years in Argentina, is a non-human personA 33-year-old orangutan granted legal personhood by a judge in Argentina is settling into new surroundings in central Florida.Patti Ragan, director of the Center for Great Apes in Wauchula, said Sandra the orangutan is “very sweet and inquisitive” and adjusting to her new home. She was born in Germany and spent 25 years at the Buenos Aires Zoo before arriving in Florida on 5 November.“She was shy when she first arrived, but once she saw the swings, toys and grassy areas in her new home, she went out to explore,” Ragan said. “She has met her caregivers here and is adjusting well to the new climate, environment and the other great apes at the center.She added: “This is the first time in over a decade that Sandra has had the opportunity to meet other orangutans, and she will meet them when she chooses. It is a new freedom for her, and one we are grateful to provide.”Judge Elena Liberatori’s landmark ruling in 2015 declared that Sandra is legally not an animal, but a non-human person, thus entitled to some legal rights enjoyed by people, and better living conditions.“With that ruling I wanted to tell society something new, that animals are sentient beings and that the first right they have is our obligation to respect them,” the judge told the Associated Press.But without a clear alternative, Sandra remained at the antiquated zoo, which closed in 2016, until leaving for the US in late September. She was in quarantine for a month at a zoo in Kansas before arriving in Florida.At the center, Sandra joins 21 orangutans and 31 chimpanzees rescued or retired from circuses, stage shows and the exotic pet trade.The case is not unlike that of an elephant in New York, where lawyers are arguing in a case currently going through the courts that the animal, Happy, is, contrary to her sunny name, being detained by the Bronx Zoo “illegally”, due to her personhood, and must be released."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4075992.1573154110!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ex submariner steve aiken on assuming uup leadership","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew UUP leader Stephen Aiken at the party’s  office in Ballyclare. Photograph: Colm LenaghanPacemakerPoliticians often use nautical terminology, though few of them know one end of a boat from the other. And then there is Steve Aiken, the new leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. In the past, he commanded Royal Navy nuclear submarines.Aiken takes over as UUP leader on Saturday it’s one one of the most difficult jobs in Northern Irish politics. Once dominant, the UUP has spent a decade or more searching for a role, playing a poor second fiddle to the Democratic Unionist Party. An Assembly member for South Antrim since 2016, Aiken spent 32 years as a submariner in the Royal Navy, where he commanded two nuclear-powered submarines. He has worked at a high level at Nato and in Whitehall, and more recently was the founding chief executive of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce and, subsequently, chief executive of Dublin City University’s Educational Trust. In April 2014, Aiken, then the founding chief executive of that chamber of commerce, was presented to Queen Elizabeth and President Michael D Higgins in Windsor Castle, when Anglo-Irish relations had never been better.“Later that evening I was walking out with a group of people and we were laughing and we were saying, ‘what could possibly go wrong?’. Then Brexit comes along,” says Aiken in his constituency office overlooking the square in Ballyclare, a small town of 10,000 people just north of Belfast. Aiken decorated the office himself: a portrait of the Queen, and posters from the first and second World Wars. Winston Churchill stares resolutely out from one wall, and beside him Lord Kitchener points his finger: “Your Country Needs You.” Above a door is another quote from Churchill: “Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak. Courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.” He has taken note of Churchill’s words, even in recent days, he says.Ten days ago he said the UUP would stand in all 18 constituencies. Earlier this week, he reversed his stand when it came to North Belfast – a move that improves Democratic Unionist MP Nigel Dodds’ chances of survival.Split the voteDodds, is defending a majority of 2,000 against Sinn Féin’s John Finucane. There were concerns among local unionists that the UUP would split the vote and gift the seat to Sinn Féin. The police had to be called after threats – including some allegedly from loyalist paramilitaries – were made. Insisting that the UUP did not, and does not bow to threats, Aiken says that he listened to the concerns of North Belfast unionist-leaning voters. They are “furious” about “the DUP putting a border down the Irish Sea”, but feel they have little choice but to vote for Dodds. Inevitably, he faced criticism for his change of heart, and predictions that his leadership was effectively over before it had begun. “When you have to make a decision, you have to make it for the right reasons,” he says, strongly.However, the UUP is now not the only party to stand down candidates. The SDLP, Sinn Féin and the Green Party are doing so in a few places to maximise the pro-Remain vote, in a race increasingly pitched as a Brexit battle between Leave and Remain. Northern Ireland does not have “normal politics”, he argues, citing the two-year lack of an Assembly, and a toxic culture in Stormont where the basic rules of government followed elsewhere were ignored, leading to the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) controversy that led to its collapse.Brexit, he says, has reopened the constitutional question. “It has reopened all sorts of discussions that had been left dormant, and it’s a much more complex beast because it’s opened up fault lines and seams across these islands.” Unionists, however, do not want to be in a united Ireland. “Nobody in Ballyclare is talking about it,” he says. It is for this reason, Aiken emphasises, that Northern Ireland must remain in the EU. “We’ve got to remain for the union. We have to. We don’t really have any other option.” The glory days of Windsor Castle are long gone, but relationships with Dublin must be rebuilt. Equally, Northern Ireland has work of its own to do: “I genuinely want Northern Ireland to change. It has to change. It can’t keep on going the way it’s going.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4075974.1573151726!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"double dutch 100 000 dutch citizens in uk can apply for dual nationality","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte:  his own Liberal party has been vigorously opposed to the legislation. Photograph: Frederick FlorinAFPGetty ImagesThe Dutch parliament has voted to allow about 100,000 of its citizens living in the UK to apply for dual nationality if there’s a no-deal Brexit – but has decided not to extend the same unprecedented safeguard to British nationals living in the Netherlands.“Dutch nationals in the UK should not become hostages to Brexit,” tweeted Sjoerd Sjoerdsma of the centre-left D66, the party that tabled the new legislation. “Politicians of all parties must do our best here because there is complete chaos on the other side of the channel.”The new law will mean that although, in the vast majority of cases, the Netherlands does not allow its citizens to hold dual nationality, it will make an exception for those who have lived in Britain since before the 2016 referendum, and who’ve made it their permanent residence since then.Not alone that, but the Bill will allow anyone who has been driven by Brexit to begin the process of giving up their Dutch nationality to become British instead, to apply retrospectively to have their Dutch passports returned if there’s no deal.More certaintyThe draft legislation originally included the same treatment for some 85,000 British nationals living in the Netherlands, but that provision was dropped before this week’s vote, ostensibly because they have more certainty about their right to remain here indefinitely.The reality, however, appears to have been that D66 realised there would not be enough cross-party support to get the Bill through parliament if the British expats were included in the package.Despite the fact that D66 is a junior partner in the four-party coalition government, prime minister Mark Rutte’s own Liberal party has been vigorously opposed to the legislation on the grounds that it sets a precedent by creating a unique new category of dual national.“It’s the thin end of the wedge to say that one group is worse affected than another and that therefore we must make an exception for them,” said the Liberals’ junior justice minister, Ankie Broekers-Knol.Belated supportIn the event, however, with the British jettisoned, D66 secured the belated support of the Liberals along with Labour, GreenLeft and 50Plus. The bill now goes to the Senate where it already has majority support.The number of British citizens taking Dutch nationality has soared since 2016, with more than 1,300 applying last year alone. Unusually, British children born in the Netherlands have the right to dual citizenship when they turn 18.Lobby group The3Million, which campaigns for the rights of European citizens affected by Brexit, points out that British living in the Netherlands face “catastrophic loss of their EU freedom of movement” – and says it will continue to campaign for wider dual nationality rights."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4075947.1573150122!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"labour and tories divert focus from mishaps with lavish spending plans","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour’s John McDonnell  delivers a major speech on the economy. Photograph: Richard Martin-RobertsGetty After a succession of self-inflicted mishaps destabilised the start of the Conservative election campaign, Labour ran into its first serious bout of turbulence on Thursday. Ian Austin, who resigned the Labour whip last February, said Jeremy Corbyn was not fit to be prime minister and urged “decent, patriotic Labour voters” to back Boris Johnson instead.Austin had already announced that he would not stand in Dudley North, which he won for Labour in 2017 with a majority of 22 votes, and his intervention will boost Conservative hopes of taking the seat next month. John Woodcock, who was suspended by Labour in April and said this week that he would not contest his seat in Barrow and Furness (majority 209), followed suit a few hours later in urging people to vote Conservative.In their criticism of Corbyn, Austin and Woodcock reminded voters of the Labour leader’s inadequate response to the issue of anti-Semitism in the party as well as accusing him of lacking patriotism. But their intervention also served to ert attention from the previous night’s surprise announcement that Tom Watson was stepping down as Labour’s deputy leader and leaving politics.Watson was a much more formidable adversary of Corbyn’s within the party than Austin or Woodcock and his departure is a significant moment for Labour, tightening further the leader’s grip on the internal levers of power. But his parting was cordial, with Corbyn recalling “our very convivial chats” about cycling, exercise and horticulture, adding “I hope the horseradish plants I gave you thrive”, and Watson promising to campaign for Labour.The Conservatives will hope that Labour’s trouble will help voters to forget about Jacob Rees-Mogg’s suggestion that the Grenfell Tower fire victims could have used more “common sense” and the resignation of Welsh secretary Alun Cairns after a former aide was accused of sabotaging a rape trial.Both parties on Thursday put the focus on the economy, with Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell promising an enormous increase in public investment over the next 10 years. Labour had already promised to spend £250 billion (€290 billion) on a “green transformation fund” to upgrade\u0026nbspenergy, transport and other networks and meet the target of zero carbon emissions by 2030.SpendingMcDonnell told a campaign event in Liverpool that he would spend an additional £150 billion on a “social transformation fund” to improve schools, hospitals, care homes and council houses. Taken together, the pledges would double the level of public investment in the British economy, moving the country from close to the bottom of the international league table to near the top.With long-term government borrowing rates effectively negative, Labour would fund its plans by issuing long-dated bonds and keep the spending off the government balance sheet.Chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid also announced a debt-funded investment plan on Thursday and although his proposal is more modest than Labour’s, it would bring public investment spending to 3 per cent of GDP, a level not seen in Britain for 40 years. Javid sought to present the Conservative plan as more fiscally responsible than Labour’s but as the Evening Standard (edited by former chancellor George Osborne) warned, he is walking a perilous path.“The risk is that they blur a distinction that should be clear: yes, the Tories want to spend billions more but Labour want to spend a great deal more billions than that. That’s the real choice. What isn’t a choice is that the ordinary taxpayer will pick up the bill. Because all borrowing is just higher taxes deferred,” the paper said.Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, warned that the next government could find that borrowing such massive sums is easier than spending it. He told the BBC that building hundreds of hospitals, windfarms and other infrastructure projects would have to be done gradually.“Do we really have tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of construction workers, lying idle at the moment, who would be able next week or next year or even in a couple of years to start doing this? I think the answer is almost certainly no,” he said.“It obviously takes a long time to go through the planning and sorting out things. If anyone’s ever had to sort out an extension to the house or something, they know that getting the building started isn’t something that happens next week.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons november 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.James Dean set to star in new film 64 years after his death with help from CGI Employees able to dictate to bosses the hours they work under Labour\u0026#39s plans for a \u0026#39workplace revolution\u0026#39Charles: 50 Years a Prince review: a brief history of our future king and his turbulent time as the Prince of WalesNigel Farage will have no Brexit Party MPs after the election, says Matthew GoodwinDonald Trump \u0026#39urged attorney general to hold conference saying Ukraine call broke no laws\u0026#39, US media reportsInjured US army veteran regains \u0026#39near-normal\u0026#39 functions after world-first penis and scrotum transplantHundreds trapped in shopping centre and homes evacuated due to \u0026#39biblical\u0026#39 rainfallComment: A stunning message: true Labour supporters need to vote for Boris Johnson\tComment: We should all get behind the Tories to save this country General election latest news: Jeremy Corbyn branded \u0026#39unfit to lead\u0026#39 by four senior ex-Labour MPs, who tell voters to back Boris JohnsonChild seats in Italy to be fitted with alarms after spate of deaths of children trapped in hot carsPolice officers illicitly access police computers including checks on a partner\u0026#39s criminal recordTories seek electoral watchdog inquiry into Remain electoral pact that threatens their seatsFootball for sale: former Premier League defender tells court he met two \u0026#39weird and untrustworthy\u0026#39 agents who urged him to sign for Leeds on £10k a weekHarry Dunn\u0026#39s family claims Donald Trump was ready to write cheque during meeting over teenager\u0026#39s deathJeremy Corbyn aide Andrew Murray denies he is a Russian spy and says he is not a \u0026#39security risk\u0026#39Comment: The Greens are merely the Lib Dems\u0026#39 useful idiots in this Remain alliance\tLord\u0026#39s sex assault: female fan assaulted during Test match by man using dead member\u0026#39s pass, court hears \u0026#39Best of British\u0026#39 TV streaming service attracts complaints as it emerges some classic shows are missingWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed a level grades versus fees find leading private schools","story":"with ever rising fees, how do you work out which independent school offers the best return on your investment?Does sending your children to a private school mean they will get better A-level grades?

It allows you to search for every school in England  - where their exam results are publicly available - and see how they fare against others.Hovering over a diamond on the graphic brings up the school’s name as well as its fees per term and the proportion of grades which were awarded top grades in A-levels in 2019. Independent day schools: fees vs grades - A-levelsHow it worksWe have created one graphic for day schools and another for boarding schools, as they generally charge higher fees. Schools which have both day and boarding provision will appear in both graphics, with the appropriate level of fees reflected in each one.The table covers A-level results,  as well as International Baccalaureate (IB) scores or Cambridge Pre-U grades which have been converted into their A-level equivalents.

The diploma has a focus on breadth of learning and students take six subjects which must include a literature, maths, a language, a science and a humanity. Each subject is marked out of 7, which is equivalent to to top grade A* in A-levels.Students must also study a course in theory of knowledge and complete an extended essay on a topic of their choice, which between them are worth an extra three points.To be awarded the IB diploma, you are also required to take up a creative pursuit, a physical activity and participate in a form of community service.

These are people who grew up in an increasingly hedonistic culture, when wine was becoming far more affordable, and it became the norm to drink it regularly, and share a bottle over dinner. “These are people born in the 50s, 60s and 70s, who haven’t significantly changed the habits they grew up with.”Such drinkers tended to drink more wine and spirits than beer, often not realising just how much alcohol they were consuming, he said. “The impact of this long-term is seen in liver disease, in alcohol related brain damage, dementia, cancer, blood pressure, strokes, in a whole range of health problems,” he said. Experts said alcohol was a “ubiquitous” part of British culture, in a way that not all countries share. Dr Richard Piper, chief executive of Alcohol Change UK, said: “In the UK we often drink more than we know is good for us – often more than we really want to.In-depth | Why is liver disease at \u0026#039almost epidemic\u0026#039 proportions?“It’s easy to fall into the habit of drinking for every occasion – to socialise at the pub, to relax at home with a bottle of wine, to celebrate birthdays and weddings, to cope when things get tough.”“But our drinking habits are causing more and more harm in the UK. Hospital admissions related to alcohol and alcohol-related deaths are both on the rise. In the UK in 2017 there were 7,697 deaths caused by alcohol – almost one an hour. This is the highest level since 2008.” Dr Giota Mitrou, from the World Cancer Research Fund, said the UK trends were “startling”. The report shows that Britain’s alcohol consumption is far higher than many European neighbours, including Sweden, Italy and Spain, as well as that of nations such as Australia, new Zealand and the United States.Heavier drinking countries include Lithuania, Russia, Germany, France and Ireland. The Alcohol Information Partnership, which represents the drinks industry, said: “The amount of alcohol people drink in the UK has been falling for more than a decade - people are leading more balanced lifestyles, especially among younger generations. But, where iniduals are drinking to harmful levels, there should be targeted support available to help them change their habits.”The international report, Health at a Glance, shows 64 per cent of adults are overweight or obese, compared with the OECD average of 56 per cent. Authors said the abusive use of opioids is also a concern, the authors say, with a large increase in opioid-related deaths, reaching 41 deaths per million people in 2016, up from 28 deaths in 2011.The report found the UK spends almost 10 per cent of its GDP on health, about one percentage point higher than the OECD average.UK has fewer beds and doctors than other countries The UK  has the second lowest number of beds and medics in Europe, compared with its population, the report shows. Britain has 2.8 doctors per 1,000 people, compared with an average of 3.5 doctors across all 36 OECD nations. In Europe, only Poland has fewer medics, with 2.4 per 100,000 people. Bed numbers are also among the lowest in Europe, with 2.5 per 100,000 people, compared with an OECD average of 4.7. Only Sweden has fewer, with 2.2 beds per 100,000 population.James Dean set to star in new film 64 years after his death with help from CGI Employees able to dictate to bosses the hours they work under Labour\u0026#39s plans for a \u0026#39workplace revolution\u0026#39Charles: 50 Years a Prince review: a brief history of our future king and his turbulent time as the Prince of WalesNigel Farage will have no Brexit Party MPs after the election, says Matthew GoodwinDonald Trump \u0026#39urged attorney general to hold conference saying Ukraine call broke no laws\u0026#39, US media reportsInjured US army veteran regains \u0026#39near-normal\u0026#39 functions after world-first penis and scrotum transplantHundreds trapped in shopping centre and homes evacuated due to \u0026#39biblical\u0026#39 rainfallComment: A stunning message: true Labour supporters need to vote for Boris Johnson\tComment: We should all get behind the Tories to save this country General election latest news: Jeremy Corbyn branded \u0026#39unfit to lead\u0026#39 by four senior ex-Labour MPs, who tell voters to back Boris JohnsonChild seats in Italy to be fitted with alarms after spate of deaths of children trapped in hot carsPolice officers illicitly access police computers including checks on a partner\u0026#39s criminal recordTories seek electoral watchdog inquiry into Remain electoral pact that threatens their seatsFootball for sale: former Premier League defender tells court he met two \u0026#39weird and untrustworthy\u0026#39 agents who urged him to sign for Leeds on £10k a weekHarry Dunn\u0026#39s family claims Donald Trump was ready to write cheque during meeting over teenager\u0026#39s deathJeremy Corbyn aide Andrew Murray denies he is a Russian spy and says he is not a \u0026#39security risk\u0026#39Comment: The Greens are merely the Lib Dems\u0026#39 useful idiots in this Remain alliance\tLord\u0026#39s sex assault: female fan assaulted during Test match by man using dead member\u0026#39s pass, court hears \u0026#39Best of British\u0026#39 TV streaming service attracts complaints as it emerges some classic shows are missingWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox netflix itv bbc british shows removed","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Exclusive: BBC and ITV series to ‘come back home’ to Britbox – including ‘The Office’, which is expected to leave Netflix next springThe “vast majority” of British shows will be removed from Netflix within the next year, a Britbox spokesperson has revealed.\u0026nbspBritbox, which launched in the UK today (7 November), is a brand new streaming service from the BBC and ITV to rival Netflix, Amazon and Apple TV+.\u0026nbspThe new platform, which promises to have the largest collection of British TV content ever assembled on a single website, is bringing BBC and ITV shows such as The Office “back home”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis means thousands of hours of British content will disappear from Netflix.\u0026nbspITV group communications and corporate affairs director Paul Moore told The Independent: “The vast majority of British shows will no longer be on Netflix within the next year.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  125 25.

Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  Moore explained that most BBC and ITV shows that have been licensed to Netflix and Amazon are on 12-month rolling contracts. When those contracts run out, the shows will move to Britbox.The Office, for example, “will be coming back home next spring”.\u0026nbspShows that were a co-production between UK networks and Netflix or Amazon, such as Bodyguard, “can’t come back home”, according to Moore, who added that “going forward, we won’t license things to Netflix and Amazon in the first place because we now have a home, a streaming service in the UK”.Moore revealed that the BBC and ITV have “already been quietly” taking shows back from Netflix “for the last few months”, which is why shows such as Gavin \u0026amp Stacey and Love Island have been taken off the global streaming site.\u0026nbspWhile Britbox is on a mission to reclaim British content, it will not be competing to acquire the rights to US or international shows as its focus is purely on UK-produced series.\u0026nbspTo find out what TV shows and films are available on Britbox, check out our guide.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Supreme Court will hear appeals over three days from two separate challenges to the prorogation of Parliament brought in England and ScotlandSlashing hours would bring European exchanges closer to those in Asia and the US which are open for six hours and six and a half hours respectively.Galina Dimitrova, a director at the Investment Association, said she had heard many moving stories of traders’ mental health and personal life being affected by their working hours.\u0026nbsp“From boardrooms to trading floors, we need to improve the ways our businesses work to create more inclusive environments where all employees can thrive,” she said.“Shortening trading hours, enabling a better work-life balance could bring significant benefits to City workers and firms, who will be able to attract a broader ersity of talent.”Last month the\u0026nbspFinancial Conduct Authority\u0026nbspsaid that “rhetoric” was masking a lack of real progress on increasing the number of women in senior roles at financial services firms.\u0026nbspJust 17 per cent of people in so-called approved persons roles are women, almost unchanged since 2005.The lobby groups also say that shortening hours will make markets work better.More than a third of trading takes place in the last hour of each day while the first hour tends to be quiet. There are fewer buyers and sellers in the first hour, which means it takes longer and is more expensive to match them up and make trades.Compressing the day would therefore be beneficial, traders say, because buyers and sellers would be forced to do business in a smaller window, meaning the same amount of business would be carried out in a smaller amount of time.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The British Chamber of Commerce said it had been calling for such a change for “many years”.The BCC called on ministers to raise their sights even higher to end the UK’s “dismal” rate of investment in long-term infrastructure.Created with Sketch.Top 10 marginal seats to watch at the general election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75Whichever party leads the new government, public investment is set to return to levels not seen since the 1970s, but there are differences in approach between the two.Labour’s plans for £400bn of new infrastructure were labelled “especially ambitious” by the non-partisan Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).That would take the UK from being near the bottom\u0026nbspinternationally\u0026nbspfor government investment, to the top.“The key challenge for a government seeking to deliver investment on this scale – particularly in a short timeframe – will be finding worthwhile and viable projects in which to invest,” said Ben Zaranko, research economist at the IFS.“Shortages in the number of suitably skilled construction workers, a dearth of ‘shovel-ready’ projects, and practical issues relating to delivery will be challenges the next government will need to think carefully about how to overcome.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe Resolution Foundation hailed the shift from a debate narrowly focused on reducing the nation’s debt to one that takes in a more expansive view of spending and long-term investment.Javid tears up his fiscal rules to borrow for investment“With the low cost of borrowing, austerity Britain is going to turn into hard-hat Britain whoever wins the next election,” said\u0026nbspJames Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation.“This shifts the focus to ensuring that investment delivers real returns not just higher debt.”Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership said Mr Javid’s plan for an extra £20bn of infrastructure annually was a welcome intervention and would make a large expansion of railways in the North of England viable.“These are the right priorities, and all parties in their manifestos will need to show the fiscal credibility of their plans in order for anyone here in the North, business or iniduals, to take them seriously, Mr Murison said.Others were less enamoured with the new policy direction.An editorial in former chancellor George Osborne’s Evening Standard said: “In a previous age, the Tories would make hay with the Labour magic money tree. But this Conservative leadership is also picking the fruit from its branches.“Boris Johnson’s attitude to the public finances is simple: I’m in charge, and if I don’t spend it someone else will.“No 10 wants to make billions of pounds worth of commitments on spending and tax cuts during this campaign.”Free market think tank the Institute for Economic Affairs accused both parties of abandoning fiscal restraint”.It said: “In order to make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead, politicians should be focusing on allowing taxpayers to keep more of their wages, enabling more consumer choice and reducing inefficiencies in order to save money and improve services, instead of bribing tax payers with their own money in a bid to win votes.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That put the UK 31st out of 35 OECD nations in the period since Theresa May unexpectedly lost the Conservatives’ parliamentary majority.Almost every OECD nation has outperformed the UK on exports and levels of investment, which have slowed markedly as a result of uncertainty surrounding Brexit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Trades Union Congress (TUC), which compiled the figures, said a decade of austerity, Brexit mismanagement and a fragile global economy had caused a slump in business confidence.\u0026nbspFrances\u0026nbspO’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “The UK economy has fallen into the relegation zone – and you have to blame the manager.

The Supreme Court will hear appeals over three days from two separate challenges to the prorogation of Parliament brought in England and Scotland“When Britain needed to invest, they chose corporate tax cuts. And when Britain needed to rebuild, they chose more austerity.”The picture has been particularly bleak for investment, which fell at an annual average rate of -0.2 per cent\u0026nbspbetween the second quarter of 2017 and the same period this year. By contrast, the rest of the OECD nations averaged 3.4 annual growth during that time.Once public and housing investment is stripped out, UK business investment was even weaker over the period, falling at an annual rate of -1.3 per cent.“We need leaders who will take on the UK’s rigged economy,”\u0026nbspMs O’Grady added. “And we need a plan for world-class public services, modern industry and decent jobs.”Workers have paid the price for lacklustre growth, the TUC said. That claim was supported by separate analysis from the Resolution Foundation, published on Thursday. It forecasts\u0026nbspthat British workers will only see average wages surpass their 2007 peak in November or December this year – finally bringing an end to the longest period of stagnant wages in 200 years.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a big living standards milestone and a relief for households after an unprecedented pay downturn.“But politicians tempted to use the return of ‘peak pay’ to claim that Britain ‘has never had it so good’ should remember that pay for millions of workers is still below pre-crisis levels, and that our pay downturn has left average pay £138 a week off track.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In a study last year it found that around 40 per cent of adults in the United States, 36 per cent in Britain and 14 per cent in China did too little exercise to stay healthy.Created with Sketch.

There are fewer buyers and sellers in the first hour, which means it takes longer and is more expensive to match them up and make trades.Compressing the day would therefore be beneficial, traders say, because buyers and sellers would be forced to do business in a smaller window, meaning the same amount of business would be carried out in a smaller amount of time.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The British Chamber of Commerce said it had been calling for such a change for “many years”.The BCC called on ministers to raise their sights even higher to end the UK’s “dismal” rate of investment in long-term infrastructure.Created with Sketch.Top 10 marginal seats to watch at the general election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75Whichever party leads the new government, public investment is set to return to levels not seen since the 1970s, but there are differences in approach between the two.Labour’s plans for £400bn of new infrastructure were labelled “especially ambitious” by the non-partisan Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).That would take the UK from being near the bottom\u0026nbspinternationally\u0026nbspfor government investment, to the top.“The key challenge for a government seeking to deliver investment on this scale – particularly in a short timeframe – will be finding worthwhile and viable projects in which to invest,” said Ben Zaranko, research economist at the IFS.“Shortages in the number of suitably skilled construction workers, a dearth of ‘shovel-ready’ projects, and practical issues relating to delivery will be challenges the next government will need to think carefully about how to overcome.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But this Conservative leadership is also picking the fruit from its branches.“Boris Johnson’s attitude to the public finances is simple: I’m in charge, and if I don’t spend it someone else will.“No 10 wants to make billions of pounds worth of commitments on spending and tax cuts during this campaign.”Free market think tank the Institute for Economic Affairs accused both parties of abandoning fiscal restraint”.It said: “In order to make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead, politicians should be focusing on allowing taxpayers to keep more of their wages, enabling more consumer choice and reducing inefficiencies in order to save money and improve services, instead of bribing tax payers with their own money in a bid to win votes.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises.

Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.

That put the UK 31st out of 35 OECD nations in the period since Theresa May unexpectedly lost the Conservatives’ parliamentary majority.Almost every OECD nation has outperformed the UK on exports and levels of investment, which have slowed markedly as a result of uncertainty surrounding Brexit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Trades Union Congress (TUC), which compiled the figures, said a decade of austerity, Brexit mismanagement and a fragile global economy had caused a slump in business confidence.\u0026nbspFrances\u0026nbspO’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “The UK economy has fallen into the relegation zone – and you have to blame the manager.

The Supreme Court will hear appeals over three days from two separate challenges to the prorogation of Parliament brought in England and Scotland“When Britain needed to invest, they chose corporate tax cuts. And when Britain needed to rebuild, they chose more austerity.”The picture has been particularly bleak for investment, which fell at an annual average rate of -0.2 per cent\u0026nbspbetween the second quarter of 2017 and the same period this year. By contrast, the rest of the OECD nations averaged 3.4 annual growth during that time.Once public and housing investment is stripped out, UK business investment was even weaker over the period, falling at an annual rate of -1.3 per cent.“We need leaders who will take on the UK’s rigged economy,”\u0026nbspMs O’Grady added. “And we need a plan for world-class public services, modern industry and decent jobs.”Workers have paid the price for lacklustre growth, the TUC said. That claim was supported by separate analysis from the Resolution Foundation, published on Thursday. It forecasts\u0026nbspthat British workers will only see average wages surpass their 2007 peak in November or December this year – finally bringing an end to the longest period of stagnant wages in 200 years.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a big living standards milestone and a relief for households after an unprecedented pay downturn.“But politicians tempted to use the return of ‘peak pay’ to claim that Britain ‘has never had it so good’ should remember that pay for millions of workers is still below pre-crisis levels, and that our pay downturn has left average pay £138 a week off track.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In a study last year it found that around 40 per cent of adults in the United States, 36 per cent in Britain and 14 per cent in China did too little exercise to stay healthy.Created with Sketch.

He said Mr Bloomberg had grown uneasy about the trajectory of the Democratic primary.“We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated — but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that,” Mr Wolfson said. “If Mike runs he would offer a new choice to Democrats built on a unique record running America’s biggest city, building a business from scratch and taking on some of America’s toughest challenges as a high-impact philanthropist.”Mr Bloomberg, who served as mayor from 2002 to 2013, has been the focus of speculation about a possible presidential run several times before, most recently in 2016. That year he decided not to enter the race, but to use his money to support candidates he supported, something he repeated during the 2018 midterms, when he re-registered as a Democrat.Reports suggest his appetite to plunge into the race at this late stage was connected to what he perceived as the stumbling performance of former vice president Joe Biden.\u0026nbspMr Biden, 76, who has outlined a series of moderate policy proposals, is seen by many as having the best change of defeating Mr Trump, though his lead in the polls has slipped as the likes of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and – more recently – Pete Buttigieg, have made ground.There have also been questions asked about Mr Biden’s mental and physical acuity after several debate performances in which he appeared to stumble.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Another billionaire, entrepreneur Tom Steyer, effectively bought himself a slot at the last debate by spending around $30m of his own money on advertising in key states to raise name awareness, something that was attacked by other Democrats.Whether the party is in the mood to select a centrist billionaire to take on Mr Trump, is also unclear.Senior Trump administration official to testify over impeachmentDonald Trump lost Kentucky for the RepublicansThe latest polls tell us Democrats have the wrong strategy for 2020Trump trails Democrat rivals in national 2020 election pollMr Bloomberg has made no official comment. But the Associated Press said a spokesman for the Arkansas Democratic Party said a person representing a “mystery candidate” made contact on Thursday afternoon asking about the requirements to join the ballot in the state.\u0026nbspReed Brewer, communications director for the Arkansas Democrats, said he walked the inidual through the process — which simply requires filing documentation with both the state party and secretary of state, as well as paying a $2,500 fee — and was assured that the fee would be “no problem” for the mystery candidate.There is no filing requirement for a candidate to run in the Iowa caucuses, which are a series of Democratic Party meetings, not state-run elections. It means a candidate can enter the race for the February 3 leadoff contest at any time.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

yearIran‘s resuming of uranium enrichment will be followed by similar steps every two months unless European states do more to save the country’s nuclear deal with international powers, one of the Tehran’s senior diplomats has declared.Hamid Baeidinejad,\u0026nbspthe ambassador to the UK, also warned that influential figures in Iran are advocating leaving the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in response to perceived failure by European signatories to fulfil\u0026nbspobligations under the treaty and crippling sanctions imposed by the Trump administration.The ambassador spoke amid rising tension with Tehran claiming that an International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) inspector stopped from entering a facility at Natanz was “tested positive for explosive nitrates” and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accusing Iran of positioning itself for a “rapid nuclear breakout.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTehran has accused Britain, France and Germany --\u0026nbspwho have remained in the nuclear deal along with Russia and China after the US pulled out -- of failing to establish an adequate financial structure to enable companies to trade with Iran in face of American sanctions.Iran, said Mr Baeidinejad, has been fulfilling its obligation under Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) since Washington reneged on it and brought in punitive sanctions, and was now taking form steps as a “wake-up call” to the other signatories.The decision to inject uranium gas into centrifuges in the underground Fordaw facility was the fourth move Iran has made as part of this policy.Created with Sketch.The Islamic Republic of Iran 40 years on Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Women praying during Ashura festivities in Yazd in

We have renounced nuclear weapons, but the US is pressuring us and putting impediments on the path of us getting peaceful nuclear technology.\u0026nbsp So they don’t see any positives.”Iran does not see that\u0026nbspanything can be gained by dialogue with the US as long as the Trump administration continues with its current policies, said the ambassador.“There is no interest in talking to the US.

Top Tories last night branded the Lib Dems’ new Remain Alliance “anti-democratic” – as Labour europhiles raged at being targeted by it.Pro-EU parties launched a bid to stitch up  seats across England and Wales to keep Boris Johnson out of No  and overturn Brexit.The Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid Cymru have agreed to stand aside for each other tactically across the country.They will target  seats in Wales and  in England, including those of top Brexiteers including Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and environment minister Zac Goldsmith.Boris Johnson has promised to slash the cost of American whiskey immediately after Brexit following secret talks with US officials.The PM said he would remove the EU’s crippling tarfs slapped on American imports after Donald Trump’s trade war with Brussels.Thatll be sure to make fans of Bourbon raise a rye smile#and a glass.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Just ask anyone old enough to remember British Rail.While dinosaurs Corbyn and McDonnell play fantasy politics, aspirational young working class voters have more realistic priorities. Such as wanting reductions in income tax and stamp duty.There is so much more at stake in this general election than just the threat Labour poses to Brexit.DOES anyone know what Labour’s position on Brexit is Jeremy Corbyn claims to have told his squabbling shadow cabinet to fall in behind him and toe the party line.Whether Corbyn will let the voters know what that agreed position is before the election is another matter.Given Labour fought the last election promising to respect the referendum result and has done everything possible since to thwart it, we doubt it.It is suggested Labour would try to renegotiate with the EU for a closer trading partnership , then hold another referendum.What they would do about the inevitable deadlock is anyone’s guess. Meanwhile, several Labour front-benchers have suggested they would campaign for Remain.One union leader has branded them “ludicrous”. The fudges and fence-sitting may have worked for Corbyn in  but surely it won’t fool voters again.

It really wasn’t anything but that.”But at the time of the ban, Cleveland Rape Crisis Center president and CEO Sondra Miller said: “It really pushed the line of consent.The character in the song is saying ‘no’, and they’re saying, ‘Well, does no really mean yes ’. “What we know is consent is ‘yes’ andyou get a ‘no’, it means ‘no’ and you should stop right there.”Let’s hope she’s never listening to the radio when Fire by The Pointer Sisters comes on. “You’re pullin’ me close, I just say no, I say I don’t like it, but you know I’m a liar.”Then, next verse: “You’re takin’ me home, you say you want to stay, I say I want to be alone . . . but you know I’m a liar.”Is she a “liar” who’s simply pretending she doesn’t have the hots for him when secretly she does  Or is she a victim being coerced into thinking that about herself by a controlling lover Discuss. While we still can. Or what about the Rolling Stones classic Under My Thumb, about a girl “who once pushed me around” but now, “It’s a squirmin’ dog who’s just had her day, Under my thumb, A girl who has just changed her ways” Far better, surely, to put it all out there so our kids can learn the vital le skill of rational and informed debate.A rock ’n’ roll twist, perhaps, on the premise of Shakespeare’s The Taming Of The Shrew, in which Petruchio uses a number of tactics to bring his we Katherina to heel — or is that now banned too In today’s “attention economy”, keyboard warriors desperate to be heard appear to be scouring the airwaves for even the merest whf of potential offence and, worse still, some are seeing their confected high dudgeon rewarded with a ban.And it’s not just the music industry having its chain yanked. This week it emerged that several theatres will be dropping the traditional “Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats,” instruction to avoid offending any transgender customers.Sigh. Of all the things in the world to truly feel offended by, is this really a priority  Even Barack Obama, the darling of the liberal classes, feels that the call-out culture sometimes goes too far.“The world is messy. There are ambiguities,” said the former US President during a recent interview about youth activism. This idea of purity and you’re never compromised and you’re always politically ‘woke’ and all that stuff . . . you should get over that quickly.”He went on to address the “cancel culture” on social media where someone who has said or done something to which others object is immediately shut down in a wave of judgmental condemnation.“That’s not activism.

Yet the way Ahmed’s case has been pumped up as a great cause celebre for women is frankly ridiculous.The real scandal is not that a highly paid female BBC presenter has been paid less than a male one. It is that the BBC is lavishing such fat pay on any of them while pleading poverty and ending free TV licences for people over .Ahmed’s case for equal pay is very weak. It is based on the argument that presenting Newswatch — which holds BBC’s news programmes to account — is of equal value to presenting Vine’s old show, Points Of View, which invited comments from the public on a wide iety of BBC programmes.The BBC claims the disparity is down to the fact that Points Of View is classied as entertainment while Newswatch comes under news.  Surely a more direct comparison would be between what Ahmed is paid and what her male predecessor, Raymond Snoddy, was paid.She received the same as he did. How is that gender discrimination   But while the BBC might have a strong defence in Ahmed’s case, it doesn’t endear the corporation to me.Every time the BBC Charter comes up for renewal, it poses as a terribly worthy public ­service broadcaster putting out serious, educational programmes no commercial broadcaster would touch.Unless the Government allows it to jack up the licence fee, it argues, it will mean no more David Attenborough, no more news correspondents in Mogadishu.Then, as soon as the BBC Charter is renewed, it goes back to pumping out the same old entertainment shows, many of them indistinguishable from commercial TV.A genuine public service broadcaster would not pay Gary Lineker £.million a year, Graham Norton £,or Huw Edwards £,.Compared with the fattest of BBC fat cats, Samira Ahmed might well feel undervalued. Yet earning £ for presenting a -minute programme would be a dream for many TV licence-payers, many of whom do not even earn that amount of money in a week.The BBC is merciless in its efforts to collect what is really a tax on TV ownership. Unlike other unpaid utility bills, failing to buy a TV licence is a criminal offence, leading to low-paid people struggling with finances being dragged through the courts.Last year, , people were prosecuted for non-payment. By the way,  per cent of them were women — possibly because they were more likely to be at home during the day when TV licence enforcement officers tend to call. That is the real gender unfairness, not highly paid female BBC presenters receiving less money than male presenters.Ahmed’s case has highlighted the old boys’ world from which the BBC hires its presenters.  Vine, she claims, was “gted” his Radio  show without any proper recruitment process. BBC management then allowed his agent to jack up his salary.The BBC seems to see itself as immune from the pay restraint where in the public sector. When David Cameron became Prime Minister, he said any public body would need an extremely good excuse to pay anyone more than the £, a year he then earned.Yet the BBC’s accounts for   show it paid  “on-air talent” salaries in excess of this figure.  While there have been token reductions for some male ­presenters, such as the now- retired John Humphrys, many have seen salary increases.High pay doesn’t end with the presenters. There were also  BBC managers and executives who were paid more than the PM last year.  If the BBC wants to justy the TV licence, it needs to be cutting excessive pay among its board and ­presenters.If it wants to be a commercial station, on the other hand, it should give up the licence fee and find funding from subscriptions and ­advertising.  Then it wouldn’t be our business how much its executives and presenters were paid because their salaries would come out of the pockets only of people who chose to subscribe to its programmes.This is particularly important now, in the week that both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have vowed to sort out the threat of over-s losing their licence fee exemption.As it becomes an urgent election issue, the worst look for the BBC is to be seen throwing money at presenters rather than the people it needs most — its loyal viewers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It doesn’t just signal an end to austerity but an end to decades in which governments of all parties have spent much less than similar countries on maintaining the fabric of the nation.Under Javid’s plan, this kind of investment by the Government would increase by roughly  per cent — taking us back to levels not seen consistently since the s.He argues that with borrowing costs at their lowest for decades, and the country’s accounts finally repaired after the  crash, there is room for this kind of spending.We are practically at the point, he says, where people are paying Britain for the privilege of lending us money.Soyou can put that cash towards something that gets a decent , you’re quids in.This isn’t, he insists, an indiscriminate splurge. Instead, it is investments that will pay for themselves by making Britain richer in the long run — more schools, faster broadband, better roads and railways.In the international context, this isn’t actually revolutionary.As mentioned above, most other countries our size spend much more than we do on this kind of thing.But it’s very definitely a break with the existing orthodoxy — and with the focus over recent years on getting debt down as soon as possible.For it to have the impact he hopes for, the Chancellor will need to juggle this new spending with keeping firm control over the day-to-day side of the balance sheet.He will also have to make sure that any public spending is accompanied by a matching surge in private investment — not just in new roads, railways and power stations, but businesses and machinery, too.And he will need to maintain a laser-like focus on ensuring we are picking the best projects — and running them properly.Not spending for the sake of it, just because Whitehall has set the investment target at a particular level.No one wants to go back to the Gordon Brown days of forking out billions without much of a care as to whether the benefits outweighed costs.No one, that is, except John McDonnell — only he wants to go way, way further.Because just after Javid sat down in Manchester, his Labour opposite number got to his feet in Liverpool to outline Labour’s own fiscal framework. On the face of it, McDonnell’s language about boosting infrastructure spending sounds pretty similar to Javid’s.Both were talking about investing for the future, about borrowing now to profit later.Both had their parties’ election slogans on the podium in front of them and the wall behind them, and were wearing ties that carefully matched the Tory blue and Labour red of the backdrop.But when you look at the detail, this isn’t a case of Spendin’ Saj vs Lavish Labour. It is more like the dference between being offered a chocolate bar — and stuffing your face with half a dozen Yorkies.The Tories are promising to spend roughly £billion extra on infrastructure over the next five years. But Javid insists that they will turn off the taps the moment the repayment costs get too high.Labour are up to £billion and counting. And that is without adding on the extra upfront borrowing involved in Labour’s renationalisation plans, which our think-tank estimates at £billion at least.Or the tens of billions that will be loaned to homeowners to pay for insulation, or borrowed from the private sector to build new state-owned wind farms.The amounts that Javid and McDonnell are talking about are both huge numbers.But to simply, the dference between them is the dference between spending more money, and spending all the money.And it also sets out the iding line that the Tories will surelyto throughout this campaign.But we want to spend what we can afford.Labour want to spend what we can’t.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

First we had Camilla, who worked in landmine disposal, then it was Dr Alex, the NHS doctor and this year we had “scientist” Yewande. I think what the producer was trying to tell me was that they wanted someone not quite as fit as the rest of them, but a bit smarter. No offence. It was a flattering call, I won’t lie to you ... but one that seemed about as unlikely to me as my being accepted onto the space programme. I am so not Love Island - or the face of the inevitable Missguided deal every female Islander leaves with.Despite being a slim , young, blonde woman, I cannot imagine anywhere I’d feel less at home than in the Love Island villa, where the women wear next to nothing and flaunt theirsurgically enhanced bodies.I rarely wear makeup, live in scruffy clothes and hardly ever brush my hair.The closest I’ve ever got to plastic surgery was with a “lip plumping” lip gloss - andI so much as tried to wear a pair of high heels near the pool I’d inevitably slip and break my neck.EvenI survived that, I don’t know how I’d feel about opening myself up to the show’s . million nightly viewers.The producer told me they look for a bit of something dferent. I’m a lot of something dferent and I don’t think I’d ever be strong enough to deal with the publics critical eye.The reason Love Island is so enjoyable to watch is because the contestants are all SO perfect - it’s like playing The Sims. People troll the contestants on the logic that it’s okay because they are too good looking to care. Its almost like they’re their own caricatures - they’re not real . This year, Harley Brash, , was trending on Twitter, with people mocking her mouth and lips Tragic Love Island star Sophie Gradon called for action to stop trolls who drive people to suicide weeks before she took her own le.Sophie, , told a cyber bullying conference in March she “descended into a dark place” after the ITV show because of vicious online abuse.And Zara Holland admitted she too struggled with her mental health and warned wannabe contestants: “You will be haunted by this for the rest of your le.”Im not perfect - and Id be an easy target with my stomach rolls and heat rash.I think I’d make it all too real. And this is why, I suspect, the show will never change. In order to give it the ersity it so desperately needs there will first to be a woman that doesn’t look as good in a bikini as the others, a man who’s balding, someone in a wheelchair, a person with a scar... And who wants be the first to make that change  At the end of the day, it’s a looks-based show. And I got picked last for sports teams enough times to know the humiliation of not being chosen. That’s not something I want to relive in front of the ruthless British public. And then of course there’s the fact that Love Island changes your le. If they like you, that’s any chance of a normal le out the windowandthey hate you, well, that’s your whole le out the window. The aftercarefor contestants on the show is something that’s been well documented, with both Sophie Gradon and Mike Thalassitis having subsequently taken their own lives.I got the call that so many people want to get - and I had to turn it down.Not just because of my very long term relationship, or because I’m too sensitive to face thejudgement of the nation, or that I’d be the only one to have tummy rolls , or that it would turn my le as I know it on it’s head. I turned it down because I know that all that glitters is most certainly not gold, and no amount of Range Rover Sports would see me sell my soul to this particular devil. That and the fact that I honestly don’t know how I’d be able to not throw someone in the pool for asking: “what’s Brexit   ” as Hayley Hughes famously did in Series . Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The -year-old Londoner is looking to position herself as pro-Corbyn and a voice for minority groups at the top of the party in the upcoming deputy leadership contest.    I think Iaposve got a track record of countering, holding people to account around race, equality and justice, she said.

It came after Chancellor Sajid Javid ripped up Conservative fiscal rules by pledging to invest an extra £billion-a-year in infrastructure and public services that have crumbled under savage Government cuts.Speaking in Manchester, Mr Javid said the move would “allow us to take advantage of the opportunity to invest in our future and our public services but without squandering the hard work of the British people”. But speaking later in Liverpool, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: “What happened down the road in the Chancellor’s speech was a bit of a tragedy. Our scale of investment matches the scale of the emergency we now face – both climate change and social.”   He added: “The Tories are always the same. In the s it was dole queues and sky-high inflation. Now it’s zero hours contracts, Universal Credit and foodbanks. They treat us all with contempt.” The Institute of Fiscal Studies said both parties are proposing substantial spending increases, but Labour plans would take UK government investment from the bottom of the international league table to the top.Ben Zaranko of the IFS said: “Labour’s plans are especially ambitious.” On Thursday Mr McDonnell revealed a £billion five-year fund for housing, care homes, hospitals and schools. That is on top of £billion borrowing already planned over  years – adding up to £billion a year to make the most of low interest rates.   Mr McDonnell said Labour’s plans would not be affected by Brexit , adding: “Whatever deal we seal will enable us to go ahead with our programme, whether it’s a deal or whether it’s Remain.” He said it would not count towards borrowing targets under Labour. Instead infrastructure investment would be kept off the nation’s balance sheet, leaving an estimated £billion a year for day-to-day expenditure in Labour’s manesto.The plans have faced criticism.

Paul Raynard, , “broke down in tears” when he discovered the cluster of  coins dating back to the s in a field near Ballycastle, Northern Ireland. He was with his best friend -year-old Michael Gwynne and had only dug up a horseshoe and a p coin before they found the collection after  minutes. Paul screamed to his pal thereaposs millions - this is the moment we dreamed of!” when he realised the scale of the find. Lighting engineer Paul said experts have told him it could be the biggest haul ever found in Ireland and worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.    Just one of the hoard - an ultra-rare Henry VIII coin - is estimated to be worth £, on its own. Video footage of the moment Paul found the underground treasure shows him pulling out muddy coin after coin from beneath the soil. He beamed at the Michael who is holding a phone struggled to contain his excitement. Dad-of-two Paul, from Keighley, Yorkshire, said: aposaposI jumped up and down and ran down the field in tears to find Michael.   “It’s something I have dreamed of finding since I was a kid. It was an amazing feeling.It’s like checking your lottery numbers and realising you’ve hit the jackpot.“I saw one or two coins at first but had no idea of the size of the hoard to begin with. “I went to fetch Michael who was across the field so we could share the moment together. I was shaking, I still can’t believe it now.”  Paul and Michael were in Northern Ireland for a short holiday when their friend recruited them to help find his missing wedding ring on October . The coins have been sent to Ulster Museum for official identication and valuation by a team of experts. It will take several months for the  coins to be valued in full, but Paul has said other experts have told him the whole hoard could be worth more than £,. The earliest coin in the hoard is dated , was made when Henry VIII was king and could be worth as much as £, on its own, Paul said.  He added other coins - like one dated , when the famed boy king Edward VI reigned - could be worth up to £,. Many of the other  coins could fetch hundreds of pounds a pieceauctioned off. Paul said he and business partner, Michael, usually study old maps looking out for signs of ancient settlements or battlegrounds where hoards may be buried. He said: “We had just come back from a busy business trip to China and Michael said he knew of a nice little place we could go to in Ireland for us to take our detectors.  “But we only went to that field to try to find his mate’s wedding ring. He lost it and reckons it could be in the field somewhere. “We didn’t find the ring and had only been there a couple of hours when we found the coins. “I dug a small hole and there they were. I just could not believe it.”  Lighting engineer Paul has been interested in metal detecting since aged seven when his parents bought him a treasure island book as a present. But he only took his hobby seriously when he turned  and purchased a £ metal detector, capable of picking up gold and silver items buried up to ft below ground.

After ing to the UK, Niall says he went straight to his local hospital to be hydrated via an intravenous drip and given painkillers - it was here that Niall was officially diagnosed with dehydration and food poisoning.Niall says the illness completely ruined his £ all-inclusive holiday with his partner - who does not want to be named - after claiming he was only able to eat yoghurts for four days after falling ill. He has since sought legal advice from travel litigation specialists Hudgell Solicitors. Have you suffered a holiday from hell  Email webnews@mirror    The specialists are acting on behalf of more than a dozen holidaymakers taken ill at the same five-star hotel in Cape Verde say they have ‘serious concerns’ given outbreaks have been reported in each of the last three years. Niall, an operations manager, who is the latest in a number of holidaymakers claiming they’ve taken ill at the hotel, said: “We were really excited for this holiday and had booked into the adult only area of the hotel to ensure we had a relaxing time, as it was our only break of the year. “When we arrived it looked amazing from the outside, just like it does on the brochures and websites, but once we were inside it was very dferent and soon turned into a nightmare. “We never left the hotel as it is really in the middle of nowhere and we ate in the restaurant on site. “On the second night I had a mixed kebab which just didn’t seem right. I wasn’t sure whether it was just because things are cooked dferently abroad, but I had my concerns. “The next day I was in agony with stomach cramps and really suffering with constant diarrhoea which lasted for the remainder of the holiday. It completely ruined our break as I was unable to leave the room. “A couple of days later my partner started suffering from the same illness, and it was clear other people were suffering too, as many people were not eating at all towards the end of the week and were just having water. “The whole place just didn’t feel hygienic.  There were cats roaming around the swimming pool area and they were drinking out of peoples’ glasses that had been left on the floor by their sun loungers when they were swimming. “On one occasion my partner saw dead flies in the banana yogurt. By this stage we were both poorly and desperately seeking natural yogurt, as we had been told it would help, but there was none and we would not have touched any further food after seeing that.” Niall had been due to start a new job on hisfrom holiday but due to his illness had to delay his start by a week, because he was still so ill. His partner also had to miss four days of work after ing home. TripAdvisor reviews allege widespread sickness, poor hygiene people left too ill to fly home.    Recent comments on Trip Advisor have included a number which have referred to widespread sickness of guests. Michelle Nurse, of Hudgell Solicitors, says repeated outbreaks of illnesses affecting a number of guests each year is a clear concern. She is handling cases for damages on behalf of people taken ill having travelled with holiday operator TUI. Michelle added: “Sadly we are being contacted regularly regarding illnesses suffered whilst families are staying at this hotel complex and as a result we have been instructed to represent people in seeking damages in each of the past three years. “We are talking serious illnesses in some cases which have had a long-standing impact on the people we represent. We have one client whose illness remains serious two years after they became ill whilst at the hotel, the causes of which are still being investigated.    “Others have been diagnosed with food poisoning, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia. “Our advice to tourists would certainly be to take extra precautions regarding hygienetravelling to this island. We would advise taking over the counter medication such as Dioralyte and Immodium with them on their travels. In responses to complaints on TripAdvisor, the Hotel Riu Touareg’s Online Reputation Manager has admitted a recent ‘increase in reports of cases of gastric discomfort’. The hotel states: “During the first days of October we perceived an increase in reports of cases of gastric discomfort by some guests, which has now ended. Our specic hygiene protocols were immediately activated.

James OaposDonnell, , always knew he needed to be introduced to the woman who saved his le so he could thank her properly for giving him the opportunity to watch his son Harrison, eight, grow up. And last night he finally had the opportunity to give Leah McDougall a huge hug during an emotional meeting they came face to face for the first time. James, from Manchester, said: I get to know Iaposm going to see my son grow up. I thought at one point I was going to die, especially when I was lying in hospital. Itaposs like meeting a real le superhero. Superheroes save lives and thataposs what youaposve done. Fellow Liverpool FC fan Leah, who lives in Bootle, has a daughter who is the same age as Jamesaposs little boy which made it even more emotional for her.    Hearing he had a little boy and potentially his little boy could grow up without a father, it broke my heart. If my daughter grew up without a mother, you just need your parents. Whether youaposve got children or not everyone deserves a chance to live and Iaposm glad Iaposve been given this opportuity.During a family day out for his th birthday James got the call saying he needed to go for a biopsy after months of feeling unwell. When the results came back as aplastic anemia he was relieved it wasnapost cancer, but the doctor quickly told him it was just as dangerous.    He started treatment shortly afterwards which saw him living in complete isolation in hospital for four weeks, but it didnapost work and his condition actually got worse. He was then told he needed a bone marrow transplant, and thathe didnapost get a match he would die. His siblings all got tested but none of them were a match so he knew he would have to wait for the kindness of a total stranger. Thankfully, a year earlier Leah popped out for a lunch break at work and passed a pop up stall for the DKMS Blood Donor Charity. She signed up, gave a sample and didnapost think any more of it - until she got a call saying she was a match.    James said: It was the biggest relief. I had gone from running four or five times a week to struggling to walk and I was being sick all the time. It was really hard for my family to watch me deteriorate. When the big day came Leah travelled to London with a friend and had the procedure under general anaesthetic. She stayed overnight so doctors could check on her, but she was back home the following day and back to her normal le. She said: When I tell people I have donated bone marrow the first question is oh my God didnapost that hurt  I think for a lot of people itaposs the fear of pain, but I want people to know that the pain is next to nothing. The reward for doing something like this is far greater than what you go through.    The charity are phenomenal, they look after you every step of the way. James had his transplant in March  and was in hospital for seven weeks before he was finally allowed to continue his recovery at home with his family around him. He sent his donor a card six months after the treatment to say thank you but didn’t hear back, so he tried again after the second anniversary and got a reply.They finally met on stage at the DKMS Blood Donor Charityaposs gala dinner and there wasnapost a dry eye in the house.    James said: I just wanted to be able to thank her so much for what sheaposs done. It was very important to me to thank her for saving my le. I wanted her to know how brilliant the thing sheaposs done for me is. The thought of my son not having a dad in his le, and my we not having me by her side for support. What sheaposs done is such an amazing thing.

A judge told -year-old Justin Jackson, from Basildon, that the terrying experience made the officers fear they had been attacked with acid. One officer revealed he remembered fear we could all go up in flames here like Roman candles. Shocking aerial footage shows Jackson running at full pelt from a block of flats and violently chuck petrol on the officers as they detained a man on the ground. Jackson threw petrol in the officersapos faces during a stand-off in Ward Close, Laindon, Basildon, on May , after police had chased a suspect on a stolen motorbike into the close. Joe Bird, prosecuting, told Basildon Crown Court that disorder had broken out after people interfered with attempts to arrest him. A large police presence descended on the close, near to Laindon Park and Laindon Station, at around pm after a huge chase involving the police helicopter between Canvey Island and Basildon.  Jackson admitted at an earlier hearing at to eight counts of administering a noxious substance with intent to cause injury. Judge Samantha Cohen, sentencing him today, found that Jackson did it to prevent them from making arrests. She said: Initially somethought they were splashed with a disfiguring acid or bleach, but when they smelled it was petrol they feared they would be set alight. Judge Cohen praised the officers involved as a credit to their force. The disorder on May  involved a considerable number of members of the public and the police helicopter was on the scene, he said. During this disorder, Jackson armed himself with a watering can full of petrol then brings it to the scene and sprays officers with it, Mr Bird said.    He said the impact on the eight police officers ied, with some feeling stinging on the skin the petrol came into contact with and others getting the fuel in their eyes. One described being unable to see, having his head in his hands on the floor, not knowing what was going to happen to him or how he was going to get out of the situation, said Mr Bird. He said all of the officers described a feeling of fear, adding: They realised it was petrol and they were involved in a very serious incident with a number of members of the public and they thought this could get quite considerably worse. They thought they could be set alight and left with signicantly worse injuries,not killed. Temporary Superintendent Jonathan Baldwin, reading from his victim impact statement in court, said: At the time of the incident while being covered with petrol I remember thinking aposwe could all go up in flames here like Roman candlesapos.  He said he could not seeanyone was smoking in the vicinity, adding: It was one of those days I realised I might not have got home at all. This was in my view a calculated attack carried out without regard for the lives of police officers, their loved ones and others who were nearby at the time. He said that some people came out from their homes carrying kitchen pans full of water and inviting officers to use their sinks and showers to help them. These particular memories have helped me keep a tight grip on the hope that what some people did that day is not representative of the wider community, said Mr Baldwin. Alison Gurden, for Jackson, of Ward Close, Basildon, said that he had written a letter of apology and she read it aloud to the court. In the letter, Jackson said: I was just trying to defuse the situation. He added: Iaposm deeply sorry for what Iaposve done and I can only imagine the fear they felt.  Janine Justin, , of Ward Close, Basildon, was found guilty of possessing an offensive weapon for arming herself with a hammer during the incident. She was sentenced on Thursday to nine months in prison suspended for  months and ordered to complete  hours of unpaid work. Gwawr Thomas, for Justin, said the defendant had no previous convictions and the incident was out of character. It sent shockwaves through our force Chief Constable Ben-JulianHarrington said: “When the news broke that eight Essex Police officers were attacked in such a horrendous way, it sent shockwaves through our force. I felt it just like everybody . The officers were out protecting the public doing their duty. Their response, their restraint and the their bravery was first class. “Officers know that they will have to face danger and confrontation, but this does not mean it is acceptable. I am pleased that the courts today have recognised this by imprisoning Justin Jackson for his crime. It was no surprise that all of the officers carried on their shts that night and ever since, but I know they will still be feeling the emotional effects from that day and we will continue to support them. I want to thank them on behalf of the whole force and the people of Essex for their determination and courage. They are a true testament to the what British policing is all about.

Harry and Meghan stopped by Broom Farm Community Centre to chat with families from the Welsh Guards, Coldstream Guards and Household Cavalry about what army le is really like. The Duchess took the opportunity to share details of Archie’s sleep patterns and teething experience with a few of the mums. Amy Thompson, whose husband Brad is attached to the Welsh Guards, said: “My daughter Aeris is the same age as Archie and we talked about weaning and the children beginning to crawl.is just a normal mum and it was like talking to a friend.”    The majority of the Coldstream Guards are on exercise in Kenya, while a large proportion of the Welsh Guards are coming to the end of a long deployment to The Falklands. The soldiersapos work overseas prompted Prince Harry to admit how in awe he was of the family members at home holding their households together. He said: “It’s unbelievably hard. I have so much respect and admiration for anyone who has to deal with that.”     In the same week that his son Archie turned six months old, family was clearly on the Princeaposs mind. “I can’t imagine what it’s like to miss so much as they change so quickly,” he added. Army spouse Leigh Smith brought along her eight-year-old daughter Molly to meet the Royals.    “Meghan promised not to tell anyone that I was off school,” said Molly. “She asked me who my best friend was.” Molly and her mum have been avid followers of the Duke and Duchess since they held a party to celebrate their wedding on  May last year.     It was an amazing experience for Molly to shake hands with them, Leigh added. It’s really special and a lovely boost for the whole community.” On Thursday morning a video of the Royal couple interacting with young children was posted on their official Instagram page. A caption alongside the video read: Every year during the month of November we pause to remember and honour all those who have served their country here in the UK, across the Commonwealth and around the world.    Their Royal Highnesses also wanted to show support for the families of service personnel who are currently deployed overseas. During the visit yesterday, Their Royal Highnesses met with young families who shared their experiences as parents and as couples who are often apart from their loved ones for months at a time. A reminder that a le of service does not simply describe the person wearing the unorm, but the entire family. Coldstream Guards welfare officer, Capt Colin Lewis, said the visit was a welcome tonic after a tough  months.    “The regiment are really appreciative of the support the families provide by picking up the burden when the service person is away, he explained. It’s great for The Duke and Duchess to take the time to truly understand the challenges they face. They are very down to earth, and they’ve had a snapshot of the entire community here by talking to lots of people from dferent backgrounds.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum blasts tui after finding","story":"NewsMum blasts TUI after finding hotel room damp and mouldy on £k family holidayNicola Nash, from Dundee, was incredibly disappointed with the quality of accommodation that was waiting for her family at the Hotel Globales Bouganvilla in Sa Coma, MajorcaShareCommentsByBethan Sexton:,  NOV NewsNicola Nash was less than impressed with the TUI holiday she went on \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

When she entered the holiday propertyaposs bathroom Nicola Nashaposs was confronted with mould everywhere, filthy grouting, damp walls and a sink which appeared to be propped up with a metal bar. The -year-old, her husband and three kids used towels to mop up surface water, but still managed to slip and bruise themselves. Nicola, from Dundee, paid £, for the all-inclusive package at the Hotel Globales Bouganvilla in Sa Coma, Majorca. The family travelled in September but Nicola has decided to publicly complain now after getting no response from TUI.  She complained: I find it abhorrent that you can continue to ignore customersapos complaints. I will reiterate that the place we were subjected to staying in was a complete shambles, covered in mould due to a boarded-up window, causing injuries also. Photos of the grimy bathroom taken by Nicola show white tiles with dirty grouting, mouldy splatters on part of the shower screen, towels on the floor to dry up water and peeling walls. The underside of the sink appears to be propped up with rusty metal bars glued against the wall. To add to their bathroom woes, the family felt the choice of food was very poor, prompting Nicola to capture a plate with sweetcorn and an unidentied circular object on it.    She said: We had no ventilation and the floors were extremely slippery. We had to put down towels all over the apartment floor, I slipped due to this and fell into the sink. My daughter did the same thing, she injured her foot causing her discomfort for a few days.    She added: We lost the use of our window due to a late addition of outside toilets and the smell that came up the drain into our room was disgusting. Considering we paid over £ the room size for two adults and three children was shocking. It has left me disgusted, heartbroken and stressed.    At odds with Nicolaaposs experience, the Hotel Globales Bouganvilla is rated four stars out of five on Trip Advistor. Happywandererkent praised the hygiene of the hotel, writing: The food was buffet style and there was always a good selection and everything was clean and fresh. Darren Y who also visited in September said the hotel was Out of this world.

She said: I think I’ve been reliant on the food bank every time the holidays have come for as long as I can remember. Without that I don’t know what we’d do. It’s either pay your bills or put food on the table and you really see that in the six weeksapos holidays. Mike added: We don’t have any luxuries or anything like that. We don’t go out, we don’t have holidays, we don’t do anything, there’s no money for it, we are just getting by.    I’m going to work as many hours as I can just to put food on the table, pay the bills, keep the debt collectors out the door, that’s all I’m doing but that in itself is empty. He added: I don’t want to be saying, ‘no, you can’t have that piece of bread because it needs to be for breakfast in the morning’ or whatever it is. The couple admitted that they both felt humiliated to ask for support from the local food bank. Mike said: I don’t like going into the building because I feel embarrassed I suppose.

We wouldn’t be able to provide every meal for our children. Heather said she would like to obtain qualications in journalism, enabling her to gain employment and provide for her family. She added: I don’t want to rely on the food bank. I want to be at a point where I don’t have to rely on the food bank because it makes you feel like a failure, it makes you feel like you aren’t providing for your children, which is a really horrible feeling.

Photos of the stunning four-bedroom Victorian townhouse show an exquisite home filled with period fixtures including a luxury bathroom with standalone tub. Another set of photos shows the change the neighbourhood has undergone in the last four decades, with a grainy snap from the s showing very little in the way of skyscrapers whilst more recent shots from the propertyaposs roof terrace show the distinctive gleaming glass super structures of Canary Wharf. Michael Hart, a builder and plasterer by trade, has lived in the London property since the early s, completely refurbishing the dilapidated property into a family home while holding down a full-time job and raising his two boys.  Itaposs been my leaposs work, a real labour of love, Michael said. When I bought the house I paid £, for it and helped the then-occupant and his we moved to a new property around the corner the house had become too much for them and they were happy as Larry in their new place. I gave them an extra £ to help set them up there too. The first thing I had to do was gut the whole building as it was a bit of a state.    I had a young family and was still learning my own trade so that was the hardest part, just getting it to a position where I could start making the home my own. With all the plastering and shoring up the basement, it was around six years before it was properly habitable. It was a lot of work and a lot of the time I was testing out skills that Iaposd never used before. I just moved in and cracked on. Though, nothing  for it. Every penny I earned went back into the house.  Itaposs all a bit dferent nowadays even though the extension took a lot out of me - and thereaposs a lot of mates who have helped me out over the years by offering up their skills too. But Iaposm proud of the house, itaposs taken me  years but everything is the best it can be and I did so much of it by myself. After living in the property for the vast majority of his adult le, Michael admits it will be a wrench to leave the home he spent decades labouring over, but he now has dferent priorities.  When I first bought the house, there was nothing around here, just a bus to and from the docks every now and again, he recalled. Bit of a ghost town really. Itaposs funny, now the only way I get to see any sky is by looking directly up! Iaposve spent most of the last  years living in, or surrounded by, building sites. Iaposve got my grandkids to think about now, Iaposve done all I can do here so itaposs time to go get a new place in the country somewhere I can get my hands dirty and the kids can run around. Iaposve got to the time in my le where I want a bit of fresh air and a bit of peace. Youaposre not going to get that here, itaposs a hectic pace of le full of bankers and big city types.

It must be locked in to the shoreline of the Antarctic continent, but close enough to open seawater for the birds to access food for themselves and their young. However, as the climate warms, that sea ice will gradually disappear - robbing the birds of their habitat, food sources and ability to hatch chicks. Lead author Doctor Stephanie Jenouvrier, a seabird ecologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , said: If global climate keeps warming at the current rate, we expect emperor in Antarctica to experience an  per cent decline by the year . At that point, it is very unlikely for them to bounce back.    The scientists conducted the study by combining two existing computer models. The first, a global climate model created by the National Centre for Atmospheric Research , offered projections of where and when sea ice would form under dferent climate scenarios. The other, a model of the penguin population itself, calculated how colonies might react to changes in that ice habitat. Dr Jenouvrier said: Weaposve been developing that penguin model for  years. It can give a very detailed account of how sea ice affects the le cycle of emperor penguins, their reproduction, and their mortality. When we feed the results of the NCAR model into it, we can start to see how dferent global temperature targets may affect the emperor penguin population as a whole.  The researchers ran the model on three dferent scenarios. First, a future where global temperature only increases by . degrees Celsius - the goal set out by the Paris climate accord. Secondly, one where the temperatures increase by two degrees and, finally, one where no action is taken to reduce climate change, causing a temperature increase of five to six degrees. Under the first scenario, the study found that just five per cent of sea ice would be lost by , causing a  per cent drop in the number of penguin colonies.

The mum-of-six, who is an Australian blogger, said sheaposs had to cut a few corners because of her large family. She also saves time on the washing-up by letting her kids feast with the hands.Revealing her short cuts on Mama Mia , she admitted her children donapost wash every day.She said: They don’t have to bath or shower every day.    They can quite often skip that part of the routineit’s getting everyone down. I’m like, “Fine, stinky, go to school and gross everyone out”. I personally can’t be f**ked bathing everyone every night.Justying her decision to let her kids skip a daily wash she claims the American Academy of Dermatology said that youngsters aged between six and  only need to bath once or twice a week unless they are dirty, sweaty or have a skin condition.I know it makes them look more loveable when they are all clean and smell fresh, but really, skipping a night bath or morning shower a couple of times a week won’t kill them,she added.    Talking about meal times at their home, she said: Feast with your hands. Dishes are the worst part of dinner. In other cultures everyone eats with their hands off the same plate. She added: Eating should be one of the pleasurable things you share with your kids, not a blur of angry memories.

You can’t say: ‘Don’t worry about it boys, we can just turn up and we’ll get the right calls this time’.“You need to put your stamp on the match and hurt whoever you are playing. They will be thinking the same. The talk will not be about that game. It will be about this match and what it means to us as a club.”The Dens gaffer is in no doubt his side are a “stronger group” this time around.And he points to the quality that’s been added since in the shape of former West Brom, Norwich and Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans.“I would say we are a stronger group,” James said.“We have added quality to the group. However, United will be stronger, too, because, although they didn’t make wholesale changes, they have been able to work with their players and they have been on a good run.“I think the benefits we have had on the training ground they will have had as well.“They may not have needed as much work but we felt we did need to put in the work on the training field in terms of how we go about things.“I think you can see that and, hopefully, you will see it on Friday night again.”He added: “I still don’t think we are completely there.“I don’t knowI will ever think that. In terms of training and that, then yes.“The international break came at a good time for us because we hadn’t yet had the chance to integrate Graham Dorrans into the squad.“We also had Jamie Ness coming back so it was a really good time to get a week’s training done.“Then we have had the games coming in thick and fast and you can see the benefit of that week.“The boys have been getting to know each other and what’s good and their strengths.“It is tough to just tell them that, you need to work on it day in, day out on the training field. I think even the top teams will tell you that.“Getting a settled squad after the window shut and being able to work with the boys – that has certainly helped us.”Meanwhile, the Dens boss is hopeful left-back Jordan Marshall will be fit to start on Friday after he limped off early in the - win over Morton last week.James said: “He is OK, I think. We left him out of training yesterday but he is gradually getting better. Hopefully, we caught it at the right time.“He did look a bit tired the other night, as did some others. We are asking Jordan and the others to press hard in the game but, hopefully, he will be all right.“The fans have taken to him and I can see why. He is very consistent and has a good end product as well which goes under-rated at times.“We will get him through this week and he will be fine.”"},{"url":"//www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5da6f30ce49858.60239106-472x564.jpg ","title":"dundee derby huge game but dee gaffer mcpake says league doesnt rest on result","story":"Dundee manager James McPake is backing his players to live up to the “great occasion” of Friday’s Dundee derby.However, he has stressed nothing will be decided in terms of how the Championship will finish up at Dens Park this week.The Dark Blues welcome rivals Dundee United to their home turf on Friday aiming to put right the humiliation suffered at Tannadice back in August as they were beaten - .Defeat would see Dundee fall nine points behind United in the race to get out of the Championship.Whichever way Friday goes, however, James says there is a long, long way to go in the league campaign.He said: “The derbies are a great occasion for the city. I have talked about it before, about the atmosphere and how impressive it is.“The fans are great and this week will be the same. It’s under the lights, it’s a Friday night and both teams are in decent runs of form.“It’s an important game, of course it is, because every derby is important, but nothing will be decided on Friday.“Every season someone gets tipped to run away with this league but it doesn’t happen very often. People said it after the game at Tannadice and I can understand why because of the score.“But this is a tough league and it will be nip and tuck all the way through. Nothing in this league will be decided until May.”The Dens gaffer admits that defeat at Tannadice took some time to get over but things have changed for Dundee since.He added: “The - game at Tannadice was my first defeat, so it was a tough one to take.“You have to dig deep into yourself – and you don’t get much sleep. You go over everything, it was a Friday night and that makes it an even longer weekend.“Every bad result you have as a manager hurts you more because there are so many factors to it.“Your biggest rivals got a big result over you but you need to look at yourselves and get it right. I believe we are getting it right.“We have fans and players who have real pride but we also have players who didn’t play in that game so maybe it won’t have a great impact on Friday.”McPake previously

show promotion credentials","story":"Friday night is a golden chance for Dundee United to send a crystal clear signal to the rest of the Championship that they really mean business this season.Backing up a superb victory over chasing Inverness Caley Thistle at the weekend by getting a win over their local rivals on their own patch will leave the rest of the ision in no doubt about who is the strongest side around.There have been questions raised in recent weeks over the Tangerines’ ability to go to tough venues and get the wins they’ll need to top the second tier come May.Sitting watching them at a wet and windy Caledonian Stadium on Saturday, I was left in no doubt they had answered those questions emphatically .They showed a bit of everything – the obvious talent up front in Lawrence Shankland, though he didn’t have his best game, backed up by the guile of Nicky Clark, the strength in the middle of the park through Calum Butcher and a really solid backline.The scoreline didn’t tell the whole story.Though it ended up a comfortable - win after goals from Clark and Shankland in the closing stages, Robbie Neilson’s men had to show a bit of dig, particularly in the second half when Caley Thistle upped the pressure.They created few chances, though, and that’s down to the really solid defending throughout from the backline of Mark Reynolds, Paul Watson, Jamie Robson and Liam Smith.Keep that up and Dundee, though they have been building up a head of steam themselves and have plenty quality about them, will find it dficult to find a route to goal.For me, that’s United’s most important part of their team on Friday night – centre-back.With Mark Connolly ing after a couple of months out, there’s a decision for Robbie to make – throw him back in or stick with Watson to partner Reynolds.If it was me, I’d stick with Watson after a really good display in the Highlands, with Connolly unlikely to be properly up to speed just yet.The Dark Blues have begun to show some teeth in attack in recent weeks with Kane Hemmings on the goal trail along with Declan McDaid and Paul McGowan in the last few games.Graham Dorrans is a serious danger, too.United know they have firepower up top – keep it tight at the back and they could be celebrating a major victory in their promotion

united supporters called arabs","story":"It is a question that is almost always answered incorrectly–why are Dundee United supporters called “Arabs” No-one argues that United supporters get that name, indeed Arabs are proud to be known as Arabs. Countless tangerine Keffiyehshave been donned by United supporters off to cup finals and many a t-shirt or badge announces the wearer is: “proud to be an Arab”.I produced a book earlier this year, Arabs Away, and since then have been asked several times, “So why are Dundee United supporters called Arabs ” Embarrassingly, I didn’t know for sure.The usual answer is that in the bitter winter of -, long before undersoil heating came to Tannadice, United went several weeks without a home game. Things were getting desperate, fixtures were piling up and, more importantly, the coffers were running low.So Jerry Kerr and the board moved heaven, earth, and several fierce-looking pieces of machinery, to thaw out the pitch to try to get the Scottish Cup tie against Albion Rovers, scheduled for January , , declared “on”. vw, px\"  William Briggs  Sons, roadmakers at the Camperdown Refinery down at Dundee docks, brought in a tar-burner to melt the Tannadice tundra. It worked. Or, at least, it sort of worked. The ice sheet melted away like a DFC defence at the feet of Luggy and Ralphie, but all the grass was burned off too!However, several lorryloads of sand was spread over the pitch and Glasgow referee Donald Weir was inveigled to declare “game on”.United performed well that day – Doug Smith, Dennis Gillespie, Wattie Carlyle  Co rattled in three for no reply. This led some newspapers to declare the lads in whitehad taken to the sand “like Arabs”. And the name stuck. And that’s why the supporters are called Arabs.It’s a great story, but isn’t remotely true.United did melt the ice to get that game on but I’ve searched newspaper databases, microfiche pages, several dusty archives, and spoken to people who were in the newspaper business at the time and there is no mention of United being called “Arabs” in any newspaper that year, or for several years afterwards. And anyway, it is the fans who are known as Arabs, not the team.More investigation was required. My quest led me to Graham McLaren, owner of specialist sports retailers Clubsport in Dundee. He’s a United supporter of long standing and known to most as “Spider”. vw, px\"  But before we get to Spider’s story, a short history lesson:Gamal Abdel Nasser was the de facto leader of the Arab world, from his election as president of Egypt in  and throughout the s. He was a giant of Middle Eastern politics. He defied the West during the Suez Crisis and became the figurehead of pan-Arabism, the push to unite all Arab nations. He inspired devotion from his followers and fear in European capitals in equal measure.An inspirational speechmaker, to this day he is regarded, by some, as an icon, a strong man who brought decisive leadership to a troubled region.We shall let Spider take up the story of the sequence of events that led his name to affect the city of Dundee.Spider told me: “My first season as a United supporter was  , our second season ‘up’.“My first game was v Partick Thistle at Tannadice. We won -. It was January , , and I’d not long turned . I’d gone along on my own and stood on the north terracing. Two days later, after school, I walked down to David Low sports shop in Reform Street and purchased a rattle and a black and white scarf.“I still have the rattle, I painted it black and white. It cost  , .p in today’s money.“On the Monday I’d recalled Saturday’s experience to school chums in my own year and a year or two above. I learned that some of them were in the habit of assembling for home games behind the goal at the Amalfi End, the East or Eddie Thompson Stand at today’s Tannadice.“That was it. I was to join them there at every home game for the rest of the season and way beyond.“We’d go in early, half an hour before kick-off. There was a cheerleader in our midst, a thinnish, middle-aged man wearing a long overcoat and a bunnet. Nothing unusual in that, half the men in the crowd were similarly attired. We’d shout our hearts out, our leader urging us through the repertoire. This was how it was at Tannadice at every home game.“He was always there. I can see him yet, stood in the middle of a couple of hundred choirboys he’d conduct us. ‘HELLO!’ he’d yell repeatedly, to which we would simply echo, ‘HELLO!’ That would be the warm up to get our vocal chords going.“Then, stepping up a gear, a rhyme, ‘T-E-R-R-O-R-S, are we the Terrors  ‘YES, YES, YES’, we echoed. There was plenty of singing too. ‘There’s not a team like the Dundee United’ and ‘Hail, hail, United’s here’ were two stock songs. vw, px\"  “At one particular game our cheerleader was full of it. I’ll never remember what game it was but he had a new line, a new cheer. He was on to something. After the warm-up he was heard to bellow – ‘I AM NASSER AND YOU ARE MY ARABS!’“The Amalfi End cheerleader bore a striking resemblance to President Nasser. The same dark, receding hair line and, crucially, the pencil moustache and dusky complexion.“So Nasser he became. I’d love to know what his real name was.“United supporters have been Arabs ever since.”So there it is. The name stuck. That’s why United supporters are Arabs.Unless, of course, you know dferent "},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre. A striking and beautul spot.#In the modern era, many thousands of tourists visit Tarbert each year.

Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Finally we were given Poulenc#s last Sonata. In this, and many of his works, he was rebelling against the Impressionist style and was particularly reflected in the outer fast movements with often angular and zany writing.The second half of the programme started with the Saints-Saens#s Sonata # also his last work. Unlike Poulenc, here he was harping back to the th century#s more classical style style of composition.Their official programme ended with a highly-virtuosic rendition of Chausson#s Andante and Allegro, but we were also given a short and charming encore # one of Gerald Finzi#s three pieces for clarinet and piano.This was all chamber music of the highest quality Maximiliano#s musicality, technique, emotional expression and tonal range were exemplary as indeed were those of his accompanist, Scott. It was patently obvious from their opening bars that they had played many times together with the rapport between them a delight to witness.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"cairndows getting connected by community effort","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe end is almost in sight for a path connecting Cairndow around the head of Loch Fyne.Phase one of the path project # between the Tree Shop at Clachan and Achadunan # is already complete, but the much longer stretch between Achadunan and Cairndow village is currently being built, high above the A trunk road.Contractors have been employed to do the bulk of the work, thanks to grant funding, but  volunteers have been involved in what has become a real community effort.When complete, the five foot wide path, with a firm surface suitable for walking or cycling, will feature  bridges crossing burns and will have a specially designed crossing at the A above Cairndow village.The project, part of the Cairndow Action Plan, is on track for completion by the end of the year."},{"url":null,"title":"mod success stories from across argyll","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEight-year-old Emma Litster from Lochgilphead competed in the Highland dancing competition on Thursday October , held at the at the Gaelic College.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

The River Esk snakes around the edge of the course.Prof Crofts expressed concern that dogs could easily swallow them, resulting in ldquolarge vet bills for owners.After ing the balls to the club, he has issued a call for the flood protection scheme, currently being drawn up for Musselburgh, to include measures to slow down water coming off the Pentland and Moorfoot Hills where the North and South Esk rise.Prof Crofts, of Musselburghrsquos Eskside West, a geography expert who has worked as a research scientist in Scotland, said: ldquoAlong the golf course there are very soft banks and you can see where they have been cut back, and probably there was some rough at the end of the fairway where lots of people have lost balls.ldquoWe cannot stop leaves and tree trunks being brought down the river but the speed of rise of the water level and its velocity shows that any flood prevention scheme for Musselburgh needs to look hard at measures to slow down water coming off the hills and into the river. Without this, the erection of walls being proposed in Musselburgh will not be public money well spent.ldquoMany of us feel the importance of the amenity of this stretch of the river ndash it is very fine.He said a tree planting scheme using native species should be discussed with landowners in the headwaters of the Esk catchment area, as government grants were available for such work.He said: ldquoI am talking about hundreds of thousands of trees maybe. Careful hand planting of trees is best rather than using tractors to dig ditches to prepare the land for planting as this would aggravate the problem by increasing the rate of water running off the hills. The trees would take up water from the soil.ldquoThe use of the reservoirs on the North and South Esk and the temporary flooding of the flat land along the river should be seriously investigated to store water during heavy rainfall and therefore slow the release of water into the river.ldquoIf you look at the flood issue, itrsquos caused by the river rising very fast but itrsquos made worsethere are high spring tides and a storm surge in the North Sea, and also a northerly wind across the estuary which piles the water up high and stops the river water escaping for a couple of hours either side of high tide.Professor Crofts has raised his concerns with consultants who are drawing up the Musselburgh Flood Protection Scheme and he has also made local councillors aware of his views.As for the coast, he highlighted small sand dunes which formed a natural barrier with grasses, which, below the ground level, had yards of roots acting as a natural catcher of the sand.Jackie Lambert, captain of Musselburgh Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was unaware of the issue regarding golf balls being found on the beach near the mouth of the River Esk.ldquoWhilst, the figure of  golf balls is signicant, it is unknown over what timescale these balls have accumulated andthey are all, indeed, from the course.ldquoNotwithstanding this, the golf club will happily participate in any working group looking at the wider issues of flood protection and the environment in and around Musselburgh.

I have edited it for publication here, but I have attempted to keep the story as close to the original as possible, and the story itself is completely the idea of the children.IN PRESTONPANS, there lived two nine-year-old children called Max and Lily.One day, they went on a bike ride to Preston Tower for a picnic. When they got there they laid a chequered blanket down on the grass, opened their basket and began to eat.They were about to leave after eating their food when they saw a robin perched on a nearby branch. It seemed friendly and the children fed the wee bird some of their leftovers.The robin then flew to a nearby abandoned cottage. The children were intrigued and followed the robin to investigate the cottage.They couldnrsquot remember noticing it before and they were wandering around it peering inside through small a gap in the wall. They couldnrsquot see where the robin had gone. They should have just left it but curiosity got the better of them and they searched for a way in. They were anxious to find out what had happened to the robin.But there was no way in, as the entrance and windows were blocked. So they clambered up the cottage wall, the bricks crumbling under their feet.Tired and exhausted, they finally reached where they thought the robin had landed.They found an opening which led to a dark passage. Despite being a bit scared, Max and Lily decided to investigate and walked down the passage. It was dimly lit by small gaps in the wall that let in narrow beams of light. At the end, there was a staircase. They huddled together as they walked.Then all of a sudden, the floorboard behind them collapsed.Now in fear and panic, they dashed up the steps of the dilapidated staircase into the attic.From the corner of the attic, they could just make out a small black figure running towards them.They thought they had seen the robin but it was something much worse. ldquoMouse! screamed Lily. Then they heard a glass shatter ndash smash!They were now terried and they sat in pitch darkness. The only light they had was the light that was seeping through the bricks in the walls.As they sat in fear, they realised they needed to come up with a plan to escape. They searched the cottage for a way out.As Lily investigated around the room, she tripped over a rug that seemed to have something poking upwards. She called out for Max and he came rushing down the stairs.As Max kneeled down to take a closer look, Lily revealed what looked like a trapdoor.Astonished, the children pulled the handle.It led to a tunnel which was flooded with candlelight. Who lit the candles  Max and Lily wonderedwhoever had lit the candles knew they were there.They entered the candlelit tunnel and one step at a time they cautiously moved forward.Then, slam! The trapdoor shut behind them and they jumped in fear. This was all too much for them to handle, they were desperate to get out.Then Max heard a soft but evil whisper: ldquoPlease stay, Irsquom lonely.In terror, he pulled out his phone and pressed  but it instantly shut off. ldquoPlease stay, said the voice, now sounding child-like.ldquoHelp! screamed Max and Lily through the gaps in the wall, but help never came.Then they heard something on the floorboards above.ldquoThere must be something up there, said Lily. ldquoI guess the only way out is to follow the candlelight.So they ventured further down the candlelit passageway.As the pair made their way through the tunnel, they could just make out what looked like a white figure approaching, who had a terrying grin with sharp teeth.Max and Lilyrsquos hearts beat uncontrollably as they sprinted away from this terrying image and as they did so all the candles blew out, throwing the children into complete darkness.Was this thing still there  The friends sat together in the darkness breathing heavily, in shock and terror.Suddenly, in the darkness, icy fingers gripped Lilyrsquos arms.ldquoWas that you rsquorsquo asked Lily. ldquoNo, replied Max.All at once, the candles lit up again. Max and Lily turned round and saw a horrying face: ldquoArghhhhhhh!They woke in the sunlight. ldquoWhat  said Max, confused. ldquoWhat just happened   added Lily.ldquoIt must have been a bad dream, said Max. ldquoBut both of us had the same dream, how is that possible ldquoWe had better go, they said.As they were about to leave, they saw a robin. They turned and looked at each other with a smirk on their faces and a chill in their bones."},{"url":null,"title":"port-seton-library-closing-refurbishment","story":"The library, situated within the Port Seton Community Centre, closes on Monday and will re-open on Monday, December .During this period, customers will not be able to borrow books or other loans however, they canany loans to staff at the community centre and the outstanding loans period will be extended during the refurbishment work.Anyone wishing to use a computer will be able to do so within the community centre.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, council spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: ldquoOur investment in the refurbishment of the library will result in it being repainted and the carpeting being replaced, which means that it has to be completely emptied for the work to be carried out.\"Loans can still be taken out or ed at any of the other branches across East Lothian and we have made sure that two PCs will be available to use within the community centre."},{"url":null,"title":"pumpkin-patch-nursery-boss-admits-defeat-closing-dunbar-nursery","story":"Jonathan Bruneau said the Dunbar branch of his Pumpkin Patch Nurseries would close permanently in two weeks after  years of looking after children in the town.The nursery was criticised in a recent Care Inspectorate report over changing staff and a lack of management.However, Mr Bruneau, who also has Pumpkin Patch nurseries in North Berwick and Haddington, said the problems had been created by Scottish Government demands.He said: ldquoUnfortunately we have had to admit defeat related to our ability to staff and manage our Dunbar setting.ldquoRecruiting management and senior staff has been impossible over recent years due to Scottish Government policies which have driven the average age and experience of nursery practitioners down to levels which are simply not appropriate to run a nursery.ldquoNursery staff work long hours for salaries which are not commensurate with the level of education and expertise they are expected to achieve.ldquoThis, plus the rolling out of , hours per year of free nursery care , has created a staffing crisis most noticeably felt in rural areas where staff cannot afford to travel from Edinburgh or beyond.ldquoThe final straw came when we lost our most recent manager after three months when she was poached by a nursery closer to home. This was inevitable as she had been travelling one hour each way to get to Dunbar and, even though subsidised by us to make the journey, a two-hour commute is simply not sustainable.Mr Bruneau warned of the impact of demands on private nurseries in April this year when his nursery in Haddington saw its grades fall in an inspection. He said: ldquoThis is a systematic problem which is causing a death spiral in the quality of nursery provision throughout the industry.The inspection report on Dunbarrsquos Pumpkin Patch rated its quality of care and support, staffing and management and leadership at twowith the environment rated a three .The report said that parents had contacted the inspectorate following its unannounced visit in August to discuss concerns.A high turnover in staff was raised by a number of parents, with one telling inspectors: ldquoOften when I drop my child off I have to introduce myself and my child to the agency staff.The report said: ldquoParents told us that they often did not know the staff when they dropped off their children in the morning, often resulting in their children being reluctant to attend.Mr Bruneau said that the introduction of mandatory SSSCregistration was creating recruitment problems throughout the industry.He said: ldquoBefore the advent of SSSC registration, our group of nurseries never used any agency staff as recruitment was simple. It included people of ying ages, experience and circumstance.ldquoIt was a healthy labour market now new staff are iniably under , inexperienced in le, work and certainly the care of children.ldquoNursery closures are inevitable as sites struggle to find staff, maintain standards and satisfy increased demand.He said his company had decided to rationalise itsservices, placing more experience in fewer sites, and called on the Scottish Government to reverse policies he said ruled out more mature staff from working in nurseries.He added that all five members of staff at Dunbar had been offered places at his other nurseries.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council, which used the Dunbar nursery as a partner provider, said: ldquoWe have worked with Pumpkin Patch as one of our partner providers, offering funded early learning and childcare for pre-school children for many years.ldquoOur officers have also provided extensive support to the Dunbar team to help them improve the quality of experiences following recent Care Inspectorate reports. Our assistance has been recognised and appreciated by the owners, who feel that we have done all we can to support them.ldquoWe acknowledge that this will have been a dficult decision for the owners and will have implications for their team at Dunbar. We also acknowledge the upset and disruption that the nursery closure will bring for parents using this service.ldquoOur staff will work with and support parents to find alternative early learning and childcare within the area that meets their needs.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoMore than , children are already benefiting from the expanded entitlement after we increased training opportunities and routes into the early learning and childcare sector, resulting in a record ,-strong workforce.ldquoWe are working alongside local authorities and providers to ensure the necessary workforce is in place ndash including running a national early learning and childcare recruitment campaign, increasing support for training places and modern apprenticeships, and enabling providers to advertise jobs free on the MyJobScotland website."},{"url":null,"title":"pensioner-completes-74-year-quest-discover-father","story":"David Simpson had spent  years looking for his dad after growing up in a Quarriers orphanage to the west of Glasgow before moving across the Atlantic.But his attempts proved fruitless until a visit to long-lost family in Elgin last year.John Hamilton, from Lost Haddington, then became aware of Mr Simpsonrsquos quest.He said: ldquoFrom the information David received from Quarriers, all he knew was that his father was a Jack Cunningham, a plasterer from Goodallrsquos Place in Haddington.ldquoHis niece AnnMarie Whyte did a search for Goodallrsquos Place and the result came back with a find against a Lost Haddington image for the old Goodallrsquos shop on the townrsquos Bridge Street this led to AnnMarie posting a question askingI knew who Jack Cunningham was.ldquoA search of the Lost Haddington collection for Cunningham brought back too many matches, so the search was honed to lsquoplastererrsquo and the results produced the equivalent of a Holy Grail image ndash a George Angus scan of a lsquoJohnrsquo Cunninghamrsquos security application to RAF East Fortune.As well as correcting the name, the image confirmed his occupation and address, as well as his height, hair and eye colour.A plea was put on social media for further information, which found that Johnrsquos nickname was lsquoGibbyrsquo and that David had a cousin living in Musselburgh called Janette Brotherstone.Mr Hamilton said: ldquoAlso, a further search of Lost Haddington for the word lsquoGibbyrsquo, with it being an unusual name, produced another George Angus image from  showing Davidrsquos father John when he was only five or six years old holding the date plate for his school photo ndash George had annotated the image saying the lsquoboy holding the date slate was Gibby Cunninghamrsquo, so when I sent David this image it was the first time hersquod seen his father.ldquoThe feedback from the Lost Haddington followers also indicated that John died in  when he lived at No  St Annrsquos Place.ldquoThrough the invaluable feedback which named Janette as his first cousin, David was put in touch with her and shersquos since sent him some old family photos showing his father throughout his le.ldquoThe photos came from Davidrsquos fatherrsquos home, where he died, as it was Janette who dealt with the death notices for both Davidrsquos father and Johnrsquos we Jessie Cagder.ldquoDavid visited Scotland in autumn  so I offered to bring him to Haddington, which he accepted.From there, David, who now lives in Rochester, New York, was able to see the home where his dad was born on Haddingtonrsquos St Martinrsquos Gate, as well as his homes on Goodallrsquos Place and St Annrsquos Place.It is thought Davidrsquos dad was lodged with a landlady while working in Elgin in .According to Mr Hamilton: ldquoThe landladyrsquos husband was away from home for two years as a soldier in World War Two and itrsquos during this period that John and the landlady must have had a moment of indiscretion together, which produced David!ldquoWhen the landladyrsquos husband ed home from the war due to injury and found his we holding baby David ndash that couldnrsquot have been his ndash he gave his we the ultimatum: lsquoTake him to the orphanage or itrsquos a orce.rsquoldquoAt the age of around one month old, David was taken to the Quarriers orphanage which is near the Bridge of Weir to the west of Glasgow.David left Quarriers at the age of  and eventually moved to Winnipeg in Canada in  before eventually settling in New York.More than  years ago, he began his bid to track down his family.

Originally coined some years ago by older campaigners wishing for a more sustainable, secure and resilient system of food production and distribution, the -year-old Scot is taking up the baton ndash albeit it on a tiny Perthshire footprint.Four years ago, at the age of , the Dunkeld-born student became the youngest-ever finalist in the long-running reality baking show The Great British Bake-Off [GBBO]. Watched by  million viewers worldwide, she was the runner-up in the  finale and instantly became a media darling. Evidently thrilled and reassured in equal measure to have such a young woman embrace ndash in her reassuring mid-Scots accent ndash the ancient culinary art of baking using centuries-old techniques, print and broadcast commissioning editors flocked to her oven door. Her first cookbook was published, and her online presence rose faster than the lightest souffle. Here was a new domestic goddess in whose delicate hands baking was safe. The world, it seemed, was her ice-cream oyster.Then she turned the tables. Eschewing the bright lights, she has settled instead for her own tiny craft bakery in a th century village in rural Perthshire where she quietly and happily puts in a -hour day. Itrsquos from this modest ndashinfinitely pretty ndash base that she hopes to influence our relationship with food for the better.Not that shersquos about to disappear completely: with its white-painted -year-old stone walls, original black range, front door draped with garlands of dried flowers, the setting for her glass-fronted display of fresh craft bakery items, Aran, is the last word in Instagrammability. Named after the Gaelic for bread, it is also the title of her second cookbook.ldquoYeah, it was a bit of a ballsy move, she agrees of her snap decision to buy the bakery in . ldquoItrsquos been wonderful. I call it my flour oasis. Wersquore perched on little white-painted stepping stools in a corner of the busy shop floor, trying not to get in the way of the constant stream of customers ndash a combination of locals and tourists ndash looking for her trademark homemade croissants, cakes, pastries and sourdough breads which have sustainability hard-baked into every bite.Shedden put her studies on hold ndash she was doing a history of art degree at St Andrews ndash to set up Aran with her friend Angus and her boyfriend of just five months at the time, James Irvine, who now manages the Birnam Arts Centre. The pair live together in the flat above the shop. A crowdfunding campaign raised pound, for refurbishment and grants from the SSE windfarm community fund, combined with a bank loan and proceeds from her first book Gatherings, made her long-held dream possible.ldquoIrsquod immediately become jealous when Angus told me he had a lsquobread shedrsquo, a place where he would create loaves upon loaves post-work and early in the morning, she says. ldquoHis magic little set-up was exactly what I had been looking for. It took a year for the trio and other family and friends to get the bakery open.I remark on how busy Aran is, and am informed it does some  transactions a day . The elongated Scottish tourist season means they are busy all year round rather than the traditional Easter to September.ldquoPeople have no idea how much work goes into this and how much we bake every single day, she says. A production kitchen on a small industrial park up the road in Birnam has helped alleviate the flow.So far, so impressive.But Irsquom intrigued.Alongside gorgeous recipes on how to make the goodies in the bakery ndash think Whisky Eccles cakes, pistachio and lime loaf, or butternut squash and Birnam honey loafndash her new book features little drop-in biogs of her regular customers and staff, many of them men, and also of her father. So the female vibe of her previous book, in which she praised the influence of women on home cooking, seems to have morphed into something more collegiate and collaborative ndash as well as less sugary-sweet. Aran follows a day in the le of the bakery, hour by hour and ritual by ritual, and there are recipes for sandwiches, salads, savoury tarts and sandwiches ndash and a heavy emphasis on sourdough breads, brioches and croissants.So, does running a bakery span the genders  ldquoYeah, it used to be all women but the balance is more even now. In fact, I call my team lsquoThe Boysrsquo, she says. ldquoGatherings was more focused on home and family whereas this is much bigger and wider in scope and people. What wersquore doing here is definitely more collaborative. People of both genders bring in ideas and suggestions, either orally or from memory, and we try them out. Wersquore doing continual RD and things are developing organically. And in the village, the wider community spirit is strong.She makes a point of sourcing ingredients, including the all-important flour, from the community and from Scotland as much as possible. Salmon is from the Dunkeld Smoke House, honey from master beekeeper John Taylor, and fresh produce is from the organic Dunkeld and Birnam Community Growing, known as The Field, and from Blackhall Farm. Butter is from Grahamrsquos Dairies, although her Lescure patisserie butter ndash good for croissants and pastries due to its high fat content ndash is from France. With Brexit in mind, she is looking for alternative local sources to provide her with the  kilos she goes through every week.ldquoThe really important thing for us is to be sustainable, she says.Her message about eating sensibly is also strong, and she cites the Rome-based food writer Rachel Roddy and the Irish writer Diana Henry as her food heroes for their ldquosensible approach to healthy eating.In Aran, she writes: ldquoSugar gets a bad rep, as does gluten, sadly. But my principles remain the same throughout this bizarre time. Use proper and honest ingredients and think of food as a source of fuel and satisfaction, not as something to fear or discuss negatively.Kale, which she says, ldquogets all the attention by the clean-eaters, and I worry it will put people off it, features strongly in her salad section alongside squash, carrot tops, heirloom tomatoes and asparagus. Therersquos a foraged nettle and pea quiche in a nod to Scottish culinary history and nettle pudding, ldquothe oldest recorded pudding in the book, but unlikely to make a reappearance.Her misgivings echo those expressed in the  Gatherings, in which she lamented the number of people of her age-group that she knew to have eating disorders or troubled relationships with food, and how ldquoearth-shattering that could be.The equal balance between sweet and savoury in Aran is notable, and again echoes the authorrsquos desire to change perceptions that baking is all about sweetness and stodge.Does she think her peer-group ndash at almost  she is somewhere between a Millennial and the younger so-called Generation Z ndash are confused about food and diet  ldquoYes, she replies, without hesitation. ldquoI am from the generation with arguably the most delusional approach to food. Therersquos so much noise surrounding it on social media. The influencer set are hugely to blame when it comes to diet issues. People arenrsquot sure about where they stand as they receive mixed messages almost every day.With veganism gaining in popularity among Gen Zedders, does she offer vegan options  ldquoA couple, but thatrsquos not something we do massively, she replies, with an almost imperceptible sigh. ldquoApart from the fact that itrsquos very hard to cater for every possible dietary requirement, our ethos here is hugely based on local, as opposed to dietary.ldquoTherersquos quite a contentious discourse about veganism. I think itrsquos doing more damage to the planet than eating dairy from the farm  miles down the road.\"As well as her concerns about food miles, she also has health worries. ldquoI think itrsquos crazy to eliminate so many food groups at once, as veganism advocates. Itrsquos about cutting out a huge amount of the foods wersquove been eating for thousands of years. Problems seem to have occurred with the processed foods wersquove had available for the last  years. Tradition has never done us any harm. Now everyonersquos terried about their health.Sipping milky tea and casting an eye over the ever-forming queue at the counter, she continues: ldquoIt makes me laugh when people come in to our bakery looking for gluten-free. But you can eat our sourdough bread because itrsquos slow-fermented for  hours, which reduces the gluten content dramatically, is more easily digested and therefore better for your gut. I spend a lot of time trying to tell people to try sourdough because itrsquos the best thing you can possibly eat.ldquoI tell them thatthey buy a supermarket loaf they should toast it before eating it to finish off the baking. Itrsquos over-processed and over-yeasted to bake in minutes rather than days and contains  ingredients instead of just three or four. When you eat it itrsquos going to keep cooking in your stomach and make you feel heavy and bloated. Bread should never feel heavy.ldquoEverything processed is why wersquove lost touch with fresh food. E-numbers, additives, colourants, preservatives and so on are all man-made and, of course, theyrsquore going to cause damage and health problems. Naturally occurring ingredients are hardly to blame.Traditional Scottish iced gingerbread, almond and pistachio croissants and chocolate brownies are her biggest sellers. ldquoItrsquos OK to have sugar in moderation. Little and often, she says, smiling. Her own favourites are the sourdough sandwiches made fresh every day and filled with locally sourced greenery. ldquoWe donrsquot do them to order, otherwise wersquod be making cheese and ham every day, she says, grinning.She already has her eyes on the future, and hopes to open a village greengrocers soon. ldquoWe want to stay in Dunkeld and open a village store where things will be properly sourced and we can support the local area, she says. ldquoAt the moment we can only buy plastic-wrapped apples from Spain at the local Co-op. Wersquod like to further help the local growers and producers, while completing the circular system in terms of sustainability, cutting food waste and increasing food security.She concedes that shersquos in the privileged position of being in the main street of a historic village which is popular with tourists with no large supermarkets or fast-food chains to dilute her influence. The local independent butcher, smokehouse, deli and whisky shop are hardly going to do that. In fact, she believes she is part of wider grassroots movement in Scotland that is being fed ndash and in turn consumed ndash by social media.The downside of being part of the Gen Z zeitgeist is she has in the past fallen foul of social mediarsquos more unpleasant side. A self-taught cook who grew up in Dunkeld, Shedden suffered a Twitter backlash when, as a contestant on GBBO, she said shersquod forgotten to switch on the electric oven because her parents had an Aga at home that she had over  cookbooks, most of them French and that she had picked up a recipe for biscotti while travelling in Italy. Such comments resulted in the Twittersphere posting that she was ldquotoo posh, ldquotoo middle-class and ldquotoo professional ndash comments that were picked up by the tabloids.She says now: ldquoI havenrsquot been on Twitter for months. I love Instagram, itrsquos a great way to communicate and a huge part of our business comes through it. It also helped us market our Crowdfunding campaign. It is about sharing. It is far more my vibe and less threatening than Twitter.ldquoThrough Instagram it never fails to amaze me how many fantastic wee independent food places, producers and initiatives there are right across Scotland now, she adds. ldquoI think people are a lot more aware of what theyrsquore eating and where their food comes from. They are aware of sourcing and what theyrsquore putting in their systems. Theyrsquore more interested in that than in price. I like to think that from our tiny part of the planet wersquore changing things bit by bit.Aran, Recipes and Stories from a Bakery in the Heart of Scotland, by Flora Shedden, is published by Hardie Grant at pound.BUTTERNUT SQUASH AND BIRNAM HONEYWe do our absolute best to source as many local ingredients as possible, and always encourage customers to come through the door with any of their own goods.

Malign forces are gathering in Mordor, in the shape of American pharmaceutical companies, waiting for their Dark Lord Trump to gobble up the NHS and force costly medicines down our throats.The Labour leader then came out with a claim that Brexit would cost the NHS pound million extra per week in higher medicine costs. This was remarkable for being even dafter than the poundm on the side of Boris Johnsonsrsquos Big Red Bus.:If Labour win, itll be less like Venezuela than Britain circa It is based on a remark ndash subsequently retracted by Donald Trump ndash that ldquoeverything would be on the table in trade talks with the UK. The POTUS was talking even more nonsense than usual because there really is no prospect of a public service like the NHS being anywhere near the table in trade talks. And thatrsquos not me talking, but the Nuffield Trust, the leading NHS think tank.Nor is there a serious risk of American pharmaceutical companies forcing up the cost of medicines through open competition, as Mr Corbyn claims. The reason, according to the Nuffield, is because competitive tendering for drug prices has been going on for decades, and the NHS does very well out of it. As the biggest health-care purchaser on the planet, it gets the best prices from Big Pharma.The purpose of all this was to ert attention from Labourrsquos actual policy on Brexit, which is not to have any policy at all. ldquoWe recognise why people voted Leave we recognise why people voted Remain, said Labourrsquos Employment spokeswoman, Laura Pidcock, yesterday. ldquoWe are not the party of either: we are the party of both.Therersquos a philosophical debate to be had on whether it is possible to be both for and against Brexit.

But it would mean restoring free movement, joining the European Economic Area , continuing to pay into the EU budget , accepting EU trade negotiations and remaining under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.But these are things that Labour have repeatedly said they do not want. And after negotiating this spanking new deal Mr Starmer says he would then campaign against it. Those of us with long memories recall Labourrsquos ldquolongest suicide note of . This is the shortest.Labourrsquos confusion over Brexit rather disguises the fact that the Tories are also split. Mr Johnson surprised MPs by delivering a new Brexit deal, with the Irish backstop moved to the Irish Sea. But the UK would still remain under Brussels rule during the transition period and could still find itself beholden the ECJ in the subsequent trade deal.He has gone the long way round Brexit and found himself back where he started. Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party are not going to let him forget that  per cent of the new Brexit deal is actually the old Theresa May Brexit Deal.Tory hard-liners agree, but they are keeping quiet because they realise that,they donrsquot back Mr Johnsonrsquos Brexit, they probably wonrsquot get any Brexit at all. Their hopes are pinned now on forcing a World Trade Organisation trade deal after the transition period and delivering hard Brexit by stealth.As for the voters, I suspect many of them just want to see the whole Brexit madness stopped. Which to be fair is what the Liberal Democrats are proposing: to revoke Article . But there is one slight problem with this: the UK voted to leave the EU.It might very well do so again in a repeat referendum. But the Liberal Democrat ldquoPM-in-waiting, Jo Swinson, says shersquod just ignore that. Itrsquos like the head girl telling everyone that they canrsquot have fizzy drinks. She knows whatrsquos good for us.As for the SNP, well it wants a referendum on Brexit too, though itrsquos not entirely clear whether it would consider the result binding. After all, it is calling for a new referendum on Scottish independence to keep us in the EU.But has the SNP thought this through  By agreeing a confirmatory vote on the new Brexit deal, does that not also mean agreeing, in principle, to a confirmatory vote on any deal after indyref Nicola Sturgeon insists that the two are ldquoof course completely dferent. But unless she wants to crash out of the UK, therersquoll have to be a deal with London. No one can know the nature of that deal ndash on currency, debt, borders, customs and regulatory alignment ndash until after it has been negotiated.So, the SNP position begins to looklike not one, but three referendums.

At the time of its discovery during the  season it was found to contain a human jawbone and two neonatal lambs.ldquoThe vessel had been placed just outside the broch wall, very close to the entrance, when the broch was put out of use around the mid-Second Century AD. As well as the whalebone vessel and jawbone, two red deer antlers had been propped against the vessel and a very large saddle quern, a grinding stone, had been positioned against the vessel to pin it firmly in place against the broch wall. All this treatment appears to have been part of the measures employed to perform an act of closure of the broch.There are several more fin whale items from the site so it should be possible to identy relationships between animals and also match bones across the area to the same animal.Beyond the vessel, there is also a particular concentration of bone in the broch and scientists say it will be interesting to see what this research can reveal about the use of whalebone in this monumental Iron Age structure.Fin whales are also among the fastest whales in the sea, capable of bursts of km h when hunting, or threatened, and they can e fast and very deeply.Indeed, in the modern era, the fin whale was only really hunted in large numbers once the explosive harpoon was invented and so it is unlikely to have been pursued in the Iron Age.That does not mean other types of whale were not hunted, and the question of whether some whales were pro-actively sourced during the Iron Age remains unanswered. In time, further study of patterns of whalebone and species recognition from sites like The Cairns may shed light on this."},{"url":null,"title":"world-first-electric-gritter-set-forth-crossings","story":"But now anelectric gritting vehicle, which is thought to be the first of its kind in the world, will help with efforts to keep Scotlandrsquos roads clear of snow while dramatically reducing carbon emissions.Transport Scotland bosses announced the state-of-the-art  per cent electric spreading vehicle will be trialled over the coming months.The Electra vehicle, which is part of a fleet of  gritters based at more than depots across the country, will undertake patrols on the Queensferry Crossing and the Forth Road Bridge, which is still used by buses.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the move is part of efforts to make the fleet of winter response vehicles ldquomore environmentally friendly.New weather stations and sensors on the M ndash the main road linking Edinburgh and Glasgow ndash are also to be trialled, as is a new form of road treatment using reduced amounts of salt, which will be initially used on the A.Meanwhile, transport chiefs said they would continue to lease specialist vehicles to deal with the most extreme winter conditions.After heavy snowfall in previous years resulted in major disruption to traffic, new route-specic snow plans have been drawn up for key roads across the country including the M, M, Mand M.Transport chiefs have almost , tonnes of salt in storage, more than was used in the whole of last winter.Mr Matheson said: ldquoOur teams have worked hard throughout the year to ensure we are ready when dficult winter conditions set in.

In fact, with the SNP in power since , it could be argued that supporting independence is the status quo position. If some polls are accurate support for independence now stands at  per cent. Opposing independence could soon be the minority view.Yet as support for independence grows ndash as it becomes the mainstream, and the sense of historic inevitability increases ndash therersquos also a feeling that the concept of Scottish independence is stagnating, that it needs reimagined.This election focuses that tension: as support for independence appears to near critical mass, the concept begins to look very tired. The debate about independence in this election will be relatively meaningless.:New poll published on Scottish independenceWe already know what will happen. Labour, Tories and the LibDems will say itrsquos bad, the SNP and the Greens will say itrsquos good. Therersquoll be no nuance. Therersquoll be no substantive debate. Therersquoll be no new thoughts about independence, about its shape and form, about what happens after a vote supporting independence. Itrsquoll be a constitutional pantomime.Independence will even overshadow Brexit. As an issue, Brexit still retains some nuance, making debate worthwhile. The same canrsquot be said of independence. Voters may be tired but they will listen to what the parties say about Europe because there may still be something to learn, something new to inform our thinking.But with independence, our minds are made up, and so are the politiciansrsquo minds. We know the story. Itrsquos a redundant debate. Yet, ironically independence is the debate which will dominate. The real issues which matter ndash jobs, climate, housing, health, policing, taxes, schools ndash theyrsquoll all get an airing, but we know theyrsquoll come second. This is an election which politicians, especially the SNP, know rests on the constitution.Herersquos the crucial problem for the independence debate: the only vision we have of independence is a nationalist one. Independence is seen by nearly all voters as an SNP issue ndash you donrsquot like the SNP, you donrsquot like independence. Of course, the Greens support independence, but despite an environmental message of hope, they find it almost impossible to breakthrough and get their voices heard.:Scottish Politician of the Year : Nominations revealed for national award ceremonyAfter the  referendum, voters split along constitutional lines. Most newly forged Yes voters left their old political homes, like Labour and the LibDems, for the SNP. No voters primarily kept to their traditional parties and dug in to repel the nationalists.This meant independence became the sole territory of the SNP. By the time the referendum was over,  per cent of the people supported independence - yet it was the domain of one party. Thatrsquos a democratic mess, and itrsquos led to intellectual stagnation and political entropy.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Nicola Sturgeon: Send a message to Westminster about Scottish independence\",\"description\": \"Nicola Sturgeon: Send a message to Westminster about Scottish independence\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media szeKVABJ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests szeKVABJ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Independence is too big an issue for the SNP alone. I speak as a Yes voter. The party hierarchy project a vision of independence which is cautious, managerial, and, frankly, uninspiring. The vision of independence projected by the SNPrsquos base is one wrapped in a saltire it feels blinkered, insular and smacks of old-style nationalism.The bottom line is that in Scotland a nationalist ideology thoroughly dominates the concept of independence. But as the  referendum showed, support for independence grew not among people who identied as nationalist, but among people who identied as progressive and internationalist, who wanted an outward-looking Scotland rather than a regressive Westminster.:Alister Jack: evenSNP wins most Scottish seats in election Nicola Sturgeon wont have mandate for indyrefThere are plenty of people who support independence but hate nationalism ndash Irsquom one. I know a lot of No voters ndash Labour, LibDem, and even Tory ndash who say now that they see independence as a viable choice. They no longer view it as something hostile. However, theyrsquoll never vote for it because of their deep antipathy towards the SNP.What would change the entire dynamic of the debate is this:the traditional unionist parties dropped their outright opposition to independence, took a neutral position, and allowed their members to think and vote freely on the issue. That way wersquod get some robust and imaginative thinking.Of course, I accept itrsquos probably a pipe-dream, but I also said this country needs to use its imagination to make politics better. Wersquore a brainy nation, not scared of big ideas ndash so dare to imagine.Imaginewe were given a socialist vision of independence by unshackled Labour politicians. That would certainly appeal to centre-left folk like me. Imagine how fascinating it would be to hear a radical Tory voice envision a capitalist form of independence. This type of change to the tempo of discussion would also allow the Green message ndash an environmental vision of independence ndash to break through, when itrsquos most needed. Most importantly, such an approach would detoxy debate, erode isions, and sow the seeds of unity.All this would pose a serious threat to the SNPrsquos stranglehold on power. Voters who arenrsquot drawn to the SNP, but do support independence, would find dferent candidates to back who they agree with on both the constitution and bread and butter issues.In the current Brexit mess, itrsquos hard for an independence supporter, whorsquos uncomfortable with the SNP, to find alternative candidates to vote for, especiallythey feel a Green vote is wasted. This isnrsquot healthy for democracy. Nor is it healthy for the SNP. The party is sluggish and complacent ndash it needs some fire at its heels.Itrsquos bewildering why all of the other parties fail to see any benefit in taking a neutral position on independence. Labour must realise the days of Gordon Brown are over. The party has taken such slippery positions on Brexit that it can surely find a slippery way to become neutral over independence.The LibDems defy the notion of liberal democracy in their dictatorial refusal to countenance a second indyref.And the Tories  Well, it seems crazy to think of the Tories being neutral on independence, but not so long ago the party was the bulwark of the union hellip until it threw Ulster unionism under the bus over Brexit. After all, the Conservatives would sell their granny for anything which gave them a soupccedilon more power.The simple fact is that a country on the cusp of great change ndash of possibly soon going it alone in the world as a new nation ndash needs vision for the future, and right now thatrsquos in pretty short supply.

This is a day in which trans people, who are killed and murdered at a disproportionately high rate globally, are remembered and their lives celebrated,\" the statement says.The speakers Dr Heather Brunskell-Evans and Dr Sheila Jeffreys have \"regressive\" views, LGBT+ Labour Scotland said, claiming Dr Brunskell Evans coauthored a book which \"seeks to fear-monger about the transgender ideology\", while Dr Jeffreys is accused of describing transgenderism as a \"masochistic sexual obsession\".The group is calling for the meeting to be cancelled, and for Marra and McAlpline to apologise for the \"incredible hurt\"it claims they have caused.\"The narrative which the organisers of this event are trying to draw, namely that there is a conflict between trans rights and womenrsquos rights, is totally ,\" the statement states, adding: \"It is always particularly disappointing when figures in your own party, who many look up to, choose to drive prejudice against minorities, but Scottish Labour has always been a driving force for equality ... We stand in solidarity with trans people everywhere.\"The SNP has already seen splits over the issue with Ms McAlpine and other colleagues including Joanna Cherry MP insisting that unrestricted access to womens spaces for transwomen - whose birth sex was male - does in fact conflict at times with the needs of women, while others, such as MP Mhairi Black condemn such comments as transphobic.Debate over the issue has become particularly heated online. There was consternation last night after one prominent Edinburgh based trans activist appeared to threaten Marra and McAlpine online.Cathy Brennan Tweeted: \"The reason why Joan McAlpine and Jenny Marra can host ontransphobe on trans day of remembrance is because transphobes know there will be no real repercussions.They have no fear. That needs to be fixed\".Asked to clary, they went further saying: \"Im saying that you should face repercussions for your bigotry andthat isnt possible through official channels then we should take it into their own hands\".Joan McAlpine said it was perfectly reasonable for women to discuss their rights. \"We just cant say that women are the only people in the world who donrsquot have the right to define themselves and discuss their position, given the levels of violence, discrimination and pverty weom are subjected to because of their sex,\" she said.She said it was clear that a \"large and growing\" number of women are concerned about the implications of redefining women as a sex. \"People who identy as trans have rights in law for their protection and we absolutely support that,\" she said. \"But women also have rights in law and when we are in a process of consultation round these matters parliament is abolutely an appropriate place to discuss them.\"Ms McAlpine said there was nothing deliberate about the timing of the meeting, which had been dictated by the availability of speakers.

The BBC has not been able to explain why other presenters, such as [Radio rsquos The Media Show host] Amol Rajan, who presents a non-live show of less than  minutes, is in Band F.ldquoThe BBC has been unable to explain why Kirsty Young was not selected for the Jimmy Young show, yet Jeremy Vine ndash then a relatively unknown news presenter ndash was.ldquoThe BBC has not recognised that it has an equal pay problem, despite all of the evidence to the contrary. The BBC has instead promoted the mantra of lsquofair payrsquo, even though this is a legal nonsense.The tribunal was told there was no evidence that Vinersquos ldquoglint in theeye or ldquocheeky demeanour was taken into account when awarding his pay.Ms Darwin said: ldquoIt seems that here the BBC is attempting to rely on undefinable factors, such as a lsquoglint in Jeremy Vinersquos eyersquo, his lsquocheekyrsquo look, or the extent to which his personality was injected into the programme. However, there is no evidence that any of this was taken into account.ldquoFurther, such matters are highly subjective, and cannot possibly explain the dference between the two. Further, there is no evidence that there are no other people with similarlsquonaughty glintsrsquo available to work on PoV, or that a presenter without a lsquonaughty glintrsquo could not have made the programme their own.She added: ldquoFurther, evenJeremy was an entertainment presenter, it is not accepted that entertainment and news presenters operate in dferent markets, or have dferent market rates.ldquoIf the BBC wanted to rely on this argument, then they should have disclosed the data.ldquoThey have not, and cannot therefore rely on this argument now. Further, the BBCrsquos witnesses have exaggerated the extent to which lsquoEntertainmentrsquo talent is paid more than lsquoNewsrsquo talent, and the extent that this factor played a role in Jeremy Vinersquos fees for pound, for PoV.She said: ldquoThe BBC also suggested for the first time in closing submissions that standing in the footsteps or Terry Wogan, given programme history and reputation to that date, imposed additional responsibility on post holder.ldquoIn any event, the additional responsibility on Jeremy Vine could only be the case for the first year, first season of PoV presented by him.ldquoFurther there has been no evidence from any of the witnesses that PoV is an iconic brand, merely assertion by their legal team.ldquoIndeed this is a programme with ailing viewing figures that the BBC was actively considering scrapping or putting online, and which had to be filmed in the corridors of the BBC rather than in a studio.ldquoWe know that audience figures for PoV were down to . million in  and down much further by  - minute by minute figures on the whole below ,.Yesterday the barrister claimed ldquolots of women concerned about the gender pay gap row were being refused access to male counterpartsrsquo pay by the BBC.She challenged HR boss Lisa Tsalavosrsquos claims that less than three percent of pay queries the BBC received from staff were equal pay issues - rather than fair pay issues - which resulted in a change in pay.She said: ldquoWhat you have is  women who were on air having their queries resolved with a pay adjustment which results with them getting a pay increase but they donrsquot get back pay or interest do they ldquoBy categorising them as fair pay cases rather than equal pay the BBC is saving itself a lot of money isnrsquot it because itrsquos avoiding a lot of back pay and interest.Today she said: ldquoThe claimant relies on the BBCrsquos failure to provide information requested as part of the collective grievance, and in particular its failure to provide any comparator information.ldquoIf the employer fails to answer the questions within eight weeks or answers in an evasive or equivocal way, an Employment Tribunal can draw an inference, including an inference that the employer is in breach of the equal pay provisions.On market pressures, she said: ldquoThe claimant submits that this is a factor that places women at a disadvantage. Professor Rubery in her evidence to the Select Commission noted that lsquomen are more likely to threaten to quote for higher pay where unless they receive a bonus or a promotionrsquo. This must surely apply to the renegotiation of long term contracts also.The tribunal continues."},{"url":null,"title":"question-time-glasgow-review","story":"DAYS after the official declaration of a GeneralElectionand BBCrsquos Question Time rolls around, this time inGlasgow.

But now native oyster beds andother shellfish habitats are being revived and are at the highest levels in nearly years.Five years ago live oysters were discovered in the Firth of Forth, more than  years after they were declared extinct in the area.At its peak, the Firth of Forth oyster fishery produced more than  million oysters a year and even Charles Darwin went out with the boats from Newhaven while studying in Edinburgh.Over-harvesting caused the fishery to collapse by , and surveys of the Firth of Forth in  reported that oysters were biologically extinct.Now it is hoped that even with the huge rise in demand for naturaloysters, the wild populations willremain undisturbed from fishing boats and thrive.It comes as the countryrsquos seafood sales hit record levels after huge growth in the shellfish farming industry.The Scottish shellfish farming industry is now estimated to be worth approximately pound.m and employs around  people.Hamish Torrie, director of corporate social responsibility for The Glenmorangie Company added: ldquoWe are very pleased that this report by Hazel Allen, supported by Crew, has shone a spotlight on the opportunity to collaborate alongside ourselves and our Deep partners, Heriot-Watt and The Marine Conservation Society, on a lsquoBlue Economyrsquo opportunity based on environmental enhancement through native oyster reef restoration."},{"url":null,"title":"have your say on accessibility at insch station","story":"Rail users and local residents are being invited to take part in an online survey as part of the Accessibility at Insch Station Study that is currently being progressed.Accessibility issues at the station have been a longstanding concern amongst local residents and the wider community.

Indeed, given the age of the vessels operating these services, operating costs have gone up as reliability has gone down. The need to replace them with vessels that are fit for purpose is growing more urgent by the day.“Sadly, we still have no timetable for when this will happen. During the passage of the Islands Act last year, Ministers promised that these issues would be addressed in the National Islands Plan. Yet the plan published last month contained nothing new and was dismissed by Orkney Islands Council as ‘very disappointing’ and ‘without any real substance’. This at the same time as Ministers were also backsliding on promises to ‘fair funding’ of the internal ferry service.“The communities who rely on these leline services demand better, as do the crews asked to operate this ageing fleet. Given that it will take time to design, procure and deliver any new vessels, Ministers must now come forward with a timetable for bringing Orkney’s internal ferry fleet into the modern age.#The debate on Scotland’s ferry services was brought forward by the Scottish Conservatives following issues across Scotland, with the Conservative MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston highlighting services to and within Orkney and Shetland.Mr Halcro Johnston attacked the SNP’s record on ferries in the Northern Isles, and called for a long-term strategy for ferry services, as well as the SNP Government to meet its promises around fair funding of inter-island ferries.Mr Johnston said: “The SNP has always been long on promises but short on delivery when it comes to our ferry services.“From the fiasco over delivering reduced fares on the Northlink boats, to the refusal to properly fund internal ferries after pledging to do so as far back as , it’s clear the SNP simply will not deliver for the islands.“Our ferries are leline services that make living on our islands sustainable in the st century. Yet time and again, the current Scottish Government fails to treat them with the seriousness they deserve.“When a new National Islands Plan was unveiled, it was said it would reset relations between central government and island communities. But it didn’t contain a single pledge to provide Orkney and Shetland islands councils with the fair funding promised to deliver inter-island services.“Islanders won’t be fooled by an SNP government that doesn’t show any sign of taking local concerns seriously or on even meeting its own promises.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It will take around  months to create a new street level cafe-bar which would be open throughout the day, develop a new events and hospitality space, install lts and refurbish backstage areas at the Kingrsquos, which currently attracts more than , people through its doors every year.The Kings, which hosts Edinburghrsquos biggest Christmas pantomime, would also boast a new learning and education studio, as well as refurbished dressing rooms and wardrobe facilities.The venue, where Maria Callas, Ian McKellen, Maggie Smith, Margot Fontaine and Juliette Binoche have all performed previously, is a key venue for theatre productions touring the UK, but misses out on some productions because its facilities are not up to scratch.A flattened stage is proposed for the new-look Kings to allow it to host world-class dance and opera shows in future.Ms Gibson will take over from Duncan Hendry, the current chief executive of Capital Theatres, the trust which runs the Kingrsquos and Festival Theatre on behalf of the city council. Born in Glasgow, Ms Gibson worked for global consultancy giant Accenture for more than  years before being appointed business director of the Octagon Theatre in Bolton in January , where she was part of the team leading an £. million redevelopment.Ms Gibson, who was previously a regional ambassador for Prince Charles in the north-west of England, was appointed interim chief executive of the two Liverpool theatres just over a year ago.The forthcoming revamp for the Kings is expected to double the number of hours it is open to public and attract an extra , visitors per year.She said: ldquoThe Kingrsquos and Festival theatres are iconic cultural institutions for Edinburgh and Scotland, both nationally and internationally.

If you look at Level  theres a higher proportion of young people leaving school with a Level  qualication... when you look at Highers, the same picture emerges. A higher proportion of young people leaving with those qualications. Thats the outcomes of our education system.\"Scottish Tory interim leader Jackson Carlaw replied: \"I should have known that denial would be the mantra of the First Minister.\"In May she was told this was a real issue as specied there [in the civil service report] and in June she told us it wasnt. Why did you and your education secretary mislead the Parliament \"Ms Sturgeon hit back: \"Jackson Carlaw should know thats not the case, theres a wider choice available to young people today and its borne out by the statistics. A higher percentage of young people are leaving school with qualications - the percentage has increased for people leaving with two qualications right through to seven. That simply doesnt chime with the picture Jackson Carlaw wants to paint of our education system.\"Referring to a report by the Sutton Trust on subject choice in English schools, she said Mr Carlaws accusations were \"more on the money\" in terms of what was happening in England than Scotland.However, a report published yesterday by Professor Jim Scott of Dundee University claimed thatthe full extent of CfE was known in , it would have been delayed or even cancelled.Using national, local authority and inidual school data, his report found attainment in Scottish national qualication Levels  to  in fourth year pupils has dropped by at least . per cent for each level since CfE was introduced in . The number of Higher passes in S had also dropped by  per cent in the past four years - a reduction, the report claims, \"Scotland cannot afford\".Mr Carlaw said this and the civil servants report made a a mockery of the First Ministers claim that education was her top priority.He added: \"She says it doesnt matter how many subjects a child studies, her claim is how many qualications are achieved. Unfortunately for her, her civil servants looked at that too. They found that while pupils could previously leave school with  qualications at Level , they were now, on average, departing with eight, so even on her own measures she is failing.\"He added: “The truth is that both Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney have claimed subject choice is not declining, despite being told dferently by their own experts.They both now need to explain why they misled parliament.\"Education was to be her number one priority. When she made that claim she had both the goodwill and the support of this parliament to grasp the issue. But now, in the face of damning evidence, she has retreated to her comfort zone of spin and denial.“There’s a choice to make in Scotland – we can be honest about the challenges facing education and redouble our efforts to restore our schools to their rightful reputation for a broad education. Or we can allow Nicola Sturgeon to host marches and shout into megaphones in the hope that will magic the problems away.”Ms Sturgeon replied: \"He wants to talk about the period since I became First Minister so lets do that. Lets look at Higher passes - in ,  per cent of young people left with one or more Higher pass, today thats more than  per cent . per cent left with two passes now its . per cent.

To take your comment a little further, I would say that the Arts are capable of contributing much more to human le and activity than has ever been so in the past.We are rapidly becoming slaves to science as well as being beneficiaries of its wonderful contributions to le in its widest sense.The attempts that we see to put one on a higher plane than the other are futile.Every facet of human endeavour should be in the mix with the aim of formingrounded rather than fragmented people.Very well put Haydn! The Arts also let people see their inidual and collective issues, wants and needs from dferent perspectives, so also assist democracy.Expressing our creativity is also a FUNdamental part of being human, and happily there are good dancers, singers and storytellers everywhere.If humanity is to survive and prosper an understanding of the Sciences and of the STEM subjects, is vital. Sadly our political classes are mostly in ignorance of the sciences, at every level. Their bizarre and idiotic decisions display that so well. A simple example, Shetland Island Council promotes and acquires battery-powered cars to reduce CO emissions. It only has, at this time, fossil fuel-generated power to charge them with, the result.an increase in CO footprint. How scientically mindless and stupid.Oh and don#t get me started on electric cars. I#ve driven a so called gas guzzler for years. I#ve not seen any so called climate change myself, yet still I drive. It still snows in winter does it not, yet the #green# lobby would have us believe that it will be raining frogs by we don#t change our ways. What utter tosh.Actually Jerry, the winters in Shetland are exceptionally mild these days. You can, literally, count on your hands the number of days it snows. Whether this is due to human activity and this of global warming is maybe questionable, BUT the evidence would suggest it probably is the case human activity being the major cause Is there a connection, overall,between global warming and much milder winters  I sincerely hope global warming is not a situation where, like most progression, some massive disaster has to take place before we do something about Maybe there’s a touch of the prophet in his own country not being recognised.Do I detect a wee bit of sarcasm there, Haydn  lolCan the SIC backing transition to battery powered cars reasonably be described as #bizarre and idiotic# Maybe Ian Tinkler hasn#t fully thought this through.The council#s decision to buy some electric cars helps to extend the necessary infrastructure across the isles, meaning Shetland becomes more ready to welcome visitors with electric cars.The incentives to change over will probably improve and more people will want to swap over.They will need the infrastructure which the SIC#s decision to acquire a greener fleet supports. Shetland#s own generated electricity can and will become cleaner overtime, so it seems a little hard to justy Ian#s claim that the council#s decision was #scientically mindless and stupid#.Its still not entirely clear what self-proclaimed scientic expert Ian#s beliefs and motives are, but climate change deniers might well describe preparing for the future as #bizarre and idiotic#. If Ian can#t come up with a dferent tune, perhaps he can change the record.Perhaps it may just be an intelligent option to wait until Shetland has a clean, non-diesel, power generating capacity be for investing tens and tens of thousands of pounds in an electric car fleet! Especially when tunning these cars vans produce a greater carbon footprint than diesel engine cars would in any case.. A bit too deep for you Peter  Visiting Shetland with electric cars has nothing to do with whatever transport fleet the SIC operate. After all, we have a good towage fleet, when batteries run flat.I agree with Ian. Does this mean he has changed his mind on the Viking wind farm then I see Shetland council have taken delivery of  electric cars. No cars were tunned . They were new.Buying new diesel cars would not have a lower carbon footprint versus buying new electric cars. The embodied energy to produce and ship both is similar. Yes,the electricity is produced through burning fossil fuels it means they are not zero emissions once delivered. But they soon will be as long as Ian doesn#t get his way with Viking. Of course, Ian will not be around to see the worst effects of climate change so can afford to worry about his views. Far more important than the future of humanity, when you balance it up## self-proclaimed scientic expert!!#, your word Peter, just graduate knowledge.

He added SSE had raised energy prices three times in one year, and stressed the issue should be picked up in the council.A former councillor, Iris Hawkins, wondered how well the candidates would adjust to #le in the goldfish bowl.#Mr Wenger said many people knew him already as a postman and as a tourist guide. He said he was a member of Transition Shetland.As a German, he said people had noticed his lack of Shetland dialect, although he admitted having problems with English accents, too.#The most problems I have with the English isI look down to the #sooth-moothers# at  Downing Street#.Ms Valente said being a councillor meant #you can#t win#, because pleasing one person would mean upsetting another.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep at night with a clean conscience.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep well at night with a clean conscience# FRANCIS VALENTEMr Robinson has #been there before#. He said the hardest thing was the impact being a councillor can have on elected members# families.#You do have to really know what you#re in for.#Mr Flaws said he had read the hardest part was putting yourself forward in the first place.#To actually make the decision and say #this is the time. It suits me now#. Once that#s done you just have to get on with it.#As for Ms Henderson, she stressed she would be #very happy# to be accountable from the start.#There will be no curtains in my goldfish bowl,# she said.The site of a new Gilbert Bain Hospital was then brought up by chairman Jim Anderson, with Mr Robinson – who chairs NHS Shetland – left feeling distinctly on the spot.#I think wherever the site is it needs to be somewhere that is close to,not within, Lerwick. That#s going to be one of the real challenges.#Mr Wenger had his eye across the Bressay Sound.#Build the fixed link to Bressay, and build the Gilbert Bain Hospital on Bressay,# he told Mr Anderson.Mr Flaws admitted there were few options on where the hospital could be built.#You have to be looking on the outskirts of Lerwick – the south road or the north road.#Ms Valente said there was no easy solution.#I suspect any decision to build the hospital is going to be  years down the road.#Ms Henderson said any consideration needed to be #future-proofed#. But she said she was prepared to look outside of the town for the solution.#If you#ve got really good shuttle links that would ease some of the congestion. If you have it nearer Tingwall it#s more central for the rest of the islands.#If you have it nearer Tingwall it#s more central for the rest of the islands# CAROLINE HENDERSONGreen issues were raised by Debra Nicolson, who said the SIC#s economic strategy was supportive of Sullom Voe and the gas plant until at least . Where did the candidates stand on this in light of the climate emergency Mr Flaws said he believed that was why the council had not yet declared a climate emergency.#The council is going to have to update its carbon management plan and see how it is going to bring this forward.#The council needs to be more transparent on what their long-term thinking is.#Part of the discussion focused on the Viking Energy windfarm.Ms Henderson said it was dficult to address Sullom Voe #until they#ve said what they want to do#.She added she was #not a fan# of the inter-connector, and the Viking windfarm was #not a green scheme – it#s only green in the context of money#.Meanwhile, Mr Robinson said the council should declare a climate emergency #and not worry about the oil companies#.He said BP had a #huge solar arm# in its organisation, while Total also promoted its environmental credentials and the Danish Dong Energy had gone completely out of the oil and gas sector.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything– GARY ROBINSONMr Wenger said Sullom Voe helped provide the UK with oil and gas.But he said attitudes were changing, particularly with a growth in electric car usage.#Electricity you can produce without burning fossil fuels is the best.#Ms Valente said it was impossible to get rid of fossil fuels #over night#, but stressed thinking had to start now.#Maybe Shetland can do without Sullom Voe but the economy of Britain still depends on that. We need to bring it down and work on other solutions.#But I think the council does need to declare a climate emergency.#Questions were also raised on ferry links to the mainland, with concerns voiced about the number of cabins and the freight constraints.Ms Valente said the boats were #not fit for purpose,# and added capacity for freight was #dreadful#.Mr Robinson said Shetland should be able to design a ferry to suit its own needs. He said the real problems with NorthLink vessels lay at constraints at Aberdeen Harbour, as well as regulations which limited where on a vessel cabins could be placed.#To my mind we really should have the power locally to resolve our own ferry service, so we can design something that works for us.#Mr Flaws said the ferries were commissioned roughly  years ago. He said it was dficult for his family of five to get away on the ferry.#They#re just not fit for purpose. We need to say what we need rather than be told what we should be using.#Discussion also focused on the bus service, with support for cheaper – or even,possible, free – buses being offered.Mr Flaws said it would be good to see more people using buses.#If it was cheaper or free then maybe more folk would be using it. If that was an incentive to get more folk on it, then that should be looked at,# although he acknowledged some bus times did not suit everybody.Ms Valente cited an occasion when she lived in Sandveien when the bus could get her to work just before am.#They they changed the service, so that actually you either had to get to work by half eight or half nine. It#s just ridiculous. I do not know how that happened.#Mr Wenger said e-buses – smaller units which can be called upon using an app – should be adopted. He added he had enjoyed a positive experience with an electric bike.Mr Robinson – a convert to the bike himself – said there was no easy answer on buses.#The last thing you want to do is run a bus with three folk on it when in actual fact that#s causing a bigger carbon footprint than a car with three folk in it.#He berated the absence of any buses in Shetland that ran on anything other than diesel. He cited Dundee, which had a number of electric taxis.Questions were raised about how a councillor might get things discussed with other members.Mr Robinson said climate change was something he would consider attempting to raise a notice of motion over – a measure which would ensure the topic is debated in the chamber.#That is one thing the council has failed to move on so far. I suspectyou were to canvas the councillors and ask them to sign it, you#d probably get half the councillors for a start. I fail to understand why they#ve not moved on it. It#s ridiculous.#Mr Flaws said an issue that kept coming back was that people had no idea what the council#s strategy was with sustainable energy.#It#s Viking Energy, or it#s nothing,# he said.Ms Valente said she wanted to ensure everyone#s house was insulated.#There are people living in houses that are cold. There are people who can not afford to do it and are choosing between putting the heating on and having something to eat.#Mr Wenger said council office buildings should be insulated, but Ms Henderson said it was important to deal with the issues constituents bring forward. raquoInteresting, with fuel poverty so high on the agenda Gary Robinson wants to declare a #climate emergency# causing the SIC to spend scarce money on #tackling climate change#. However, the UK government has already set its #net zero # target into law, as recommended in the IPCC#s  Special Report. The Scottish government has gone even further with #net zero #. This will cost UK energy consumers over £ trillion# enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years! # causing fuel poverty to continue to soar.SIC will be allocated compulsory government targets, to achieve the above aims. Any SIC action beyond that would be superfluous and not scientically justied i.e. motivatedby virtue-signalling. SIC should spend any spare resources on alleviating fuel poverty, already % of Shetland homes, and set to expand dramatically with the above targets.I#m surprised Mr Robinson, chairman of NHS Shetland, shows such cavalier disregard for those infuel poverty when over , people died of coldin the much milder climate of England and Wales, in  .The fuel poverty buck stops there, people die unnecessarily.The #excess winter deaths I referred to are shocking and were due to people#s inability to heat their homes adequately. These are people infuel poverty.Were , people to die during a summer heat wave, the #climate emergency# fraternity would become apoplectic and there would be a frenzy of closing down every means of using fossil fuel. But winter deaths are nothing new and these people are poor, so perhaps, they don#t count .As explained above, #climate emergency# does not come from the IPCC. It is a fad of the well-off, the bourgeoisie, who care nought for the fate of the poor but wish solely to use it as a ruse to win middle class votes using alarmist rhetoric.The Shetland Partnership has a specic objective of reducing fuel poverty by a third, by  # how is that progressing And a further aim of halving it by   Aye!The SIC and NHS Shetland are key members of the Shetland Partnership and councillors need to focus on fuel poverty as, not only will this aim not be achieved, the situation will become much worse, as a result of current government climate policy..."},{"url":null,"title":"rack ruin celebrate 25 years on the music scene ","story":"Yell #party band# Rack # Ruin will celebrate their th birthday this weekend with a sold-out concert at the Tingwall Hall.Originally formed by four school friends in  Rack # Ruin has grown in size and reputation over the past quarter of a century to become one of the isles best-loved live bands.Founding members Barry Nisbet, David Spence, Kevin Tulloch and Martin Henderson have since been joined by Michael Nisbet, Brian Spence, Leslie Tulloch and Jack Jamieson.Much of the group#s early material was traditional and prominently featured the ‘Cullivoe’ style of fiddle playing, which a distinctive tuning of the fiddle and a lively bowing technique.All four original members had started out playing the fiddle at school, but the band soon ersied and expanded.

Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune. As with all adaptations,there are issues concerning the episodic aspect of narrative fiction and how thisworks on stage, in real-time. In ‘The Stornoway Way’ scene transitions areheralded by brief drum patterns that wouldn’t sound out of place in an Americansitcom. But that is to cavil. MacNeil’s play is at least as good as his novel, and the novel was very good indeed."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/KIDNEY-D-JEAN-MACINTOSH-5.jpg","title":"competition underway to create a flag for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoinen.This weeksees the launch of a competition to design a flag, which will be recognised by the Court of Lord Lyon — the body responsible for recording and protecting all heraldry, flags and national symbols in Scotland — and will be flown and displayed as an emblem of the island at home and abroad., Highland Council ward members and tourism body SkyeConnect petitioned the court with the idea for a flag following the example of several other island areas and regions which have, in recent years, adopted a flag.Philip Tibbetts, honorary vexillologist with the Court of the Lord Lyon, is to visit schools on the island next week to deliver a series of workshops and presentations detailing his interest in flags, and discussing the themes which could potentially inspire a flag for Skye.It is hoped youngsters and adults will be keen to have a go at designing the flag, and enter the competition which will run from st November until st December, after which a  — made up of representatives from throughout the community — will compile a short list of final entries which will then become subject of a public vote in February of next year.or by post to Skye Flag Competition, c o West Highland Free Press, Unit B, Pairc nan Craobh, Broadford, Isle of Skye IV AP, the potential for both the design and subsequent usage of a flag for the island is incredible.”In addition to the information provided on this page, these links will be helpful:"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LOVAT-STUART-MACDONALD-2-adj.jpg","title":"shinty hurling to take centre stage as scotland visit face ireland this","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTwo Kinlochshiel players, Finlay MacRae and Donald Nixon, are in the Scotland squad for the senior shinty-hurling match.At under- level Alan MacRae has named a -man squad seeking to seal a second win in succession against the Irish.Skye#s William MacKinnon is in line for his debut, while there is also a place in the squad for Johnnie MacAskill, the ex-Kinlochshiel player, now playing for Glasgow Mid Argyll.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,. The whole community and local business were fully behind us and couldn’t have done it without them. The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions.The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.My goal in le is to keep Ruby’s memory alive and by holding her parties its raising money in Ruby’s name for the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice.We will be forever indebted to the Hospice for all the support they gave us during Ruby’s le with respite, end of le care and all the memories we created in Horizon House. I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free. There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, little gladiators, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes,as well as Victoria Sponges with filled do-nuts.Raffle tickets cost pound a strip and can be purchased before the partythey can’t attend by contacting Lisa via Instagram: @chasingladybirds or Facebook: Lisa Powell.The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

Our smallest hawk the merlin is dexterous enough to catch skylarks on the wing. Dúlra’s walked so much of our landscape that he must have encountered it somewhere, but probably dismissed it as just another thrush – which is exactly what it wants its prey to think as well. Conor goes to the coast at Dundalk where this bird of prey often spends the winter months. But the amazing thing is that rather than a story with a happy, Hollywood ending with the merlin making a star appearance, he actually fails to spot one. As he points out, wildle documentaries take years to make with untold misses – and it’s the journey into the Irish countryside with all its hidden layers that is the payoff.Conor’s hit-list of birds isn’t an end in themselves – they’re just one part of our country’s rich tapestry. One thing he has always loved about being Irish is that there is history everywhere you go, hanging in the air around you. Birds weave their way through this rich history, which Conor does his best to unravel.And he points out that the calls of birds that used to be much more common provide an aural window into a time now gone.He goes searching for a red grouse in the Wicklow Mountains. He takes one of Ireland’s most scenic routes, the Military Road, which was cut through the mountains to disrupt rebels after the rising of . Ireland’s only remaining species of grouse love these vast spaces, where they blend into the heather – occasionally as Dúlra used to walk on Black Mountain, one would burst into the air in front of him. This is a distinct Irish sub-species, but they live in such remove and separate mountain enclaves that the red grouse have become genetic islands, cut adrt from outsiders. The lack of genetic iety leaves them vulnerable.The grey partridge which Conor finds in the flat, productive fields of County Offaly is a fascinating, incredible bird. He calls them the rabbits of the bird world, scuttling about the grass in family groups. Flight, that ancestral safety mechanism, is only used as a last resort.Living in open spaces makes them exposed from air and ground, so to compensate the partridge lays more eggs than any other Irish bird –  is the record.The destruction of Ireland’s vast forests was a boon for the partridge, and the gentle rhythms of the farm synchronised with the bird’s lestyle, giving it ample time to rear its chicks before the crops were gathered. But from the s onwards, its prospects darkened dramatically as mechanisation destroyed nests.In healthy fields where the partridge should be found, they are now missing. A stable of Irish rural le was obliterated.By , there were only  left in the whole country. At Lough Boora in County Offaly, efforts were finally made to save it, with a nursery being set up and now there are a few hundred pairs breeding there.As Conor notes, the reintroduction of eagles and kites hog the headlines, but the humble partridge is no less noble a cause. In Offaly, they decided to save the habitat rather than one species. And the partridge is one of many winners.Conor goes to Tory Island to find the corncrake – as Dúlra has done ­– and to Conamara to find the cuckoo. But the most encouraging are the goosander ducks, síolta mhór in Irish. He finds them in the beautul Glendalough in County Wicklow. This is a large, colourful duck of wild, secluded lakes, but rather than nest at the water’s edge, it needs a tree hole – the most prized nesting real estate the forest has to offer, Conor writes.It’s almost impossible to find the right one at the water’s edge, but in Glendalough they made articial nests for the goosander which the birds have readily taken to. Thirty years ago breeding pairs were unheard of in Ireland – today it’s made a stronghold in County Wicklow, and there’s confidence that with public help, there’s no reason it won’t colonise the whole country.Ireland Through Bird has been shortlisted for Best Irish Published Book  – it certainly gets Dúlra’s vote."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"a worthy tribute to kate","story":"SET against the backdrop of Robert Emmet’s  Irish Rebellion, Betrothed –written by the late theatre pioneer Kate Muldoon – will make its debut on the Grand Opera House stage in November.Chronicling the story of one of the most remarkable love triangles in Irish history, Kate’s work was completed shortly after the North Belfast woman passed away during Christmas .Starring as Emmet’s love Sarah Curran, Katie Tumelty described Kate’s writing as conveying a “powerful love story, a beautul piece of writing that really captures an era in time”.Directed by A Night In November’s Matthew McElhinney, Katie said she knew from the off “that I was going to do the piece”.“Matthew and I have a really good shorthand and work really well together,” she said. “We worked together recently on Archie In Manhattan and this is the first time he’s directed me. I really trust him and the cast can see how his mind works as a director.”Known for her comedic roles, Katie spoke of how it was great to sink her teeth into a dramatic role. “This is a real love story of a middle class Protestant who falls in love with an Irish rebel – and we’ll leave it there,” she laughed.“I don’t want to give too much away.

I probably got under her feet a lot but she was always so kind and caring and would sneak me treats.

Speaking ahead of the November  ballot closure, Unison’s RVH Joint Branch Secretary, Conor McCarthy, said workers were “sick, sore and tired of being treated as second class workers”.“TheTrusts are finding it very dficult to recruit and retain staff across all disciplines because every single health worker here is going to work every morning with lower pay than their counterparts across the rest of the UK,” he said.“Workers feel very undervalued. “They feel that the Trust, at executive level, aren’t speaking up for them.“The Permanent Secretary of the Department of Health, Richard Pengelly, nor any of the other executives across the region, has yet to come out and say that health workers deserve pay parity.”Mr McCarthy insisted that money for a “pay parity” increase had been allocated through the Westminster Barnett Formula, and called into question what it “being used for”.He also insisted that pay parity would have overarching “positive implications” for local NHS staffing levels and waiting lists.“This is not just about pay,” he said.“Pay is the foundation of this dispute, but pay parity would lead to positive implications on waiting lists.“If people are paid properly and paid equally it will help with the recruitment and retention of staff. Therefore, more staff will be employed and there will be more staff available to bring down waiting lists.”Mr McCarthy said that, in the event of a yes vote, Unison members would be asked to take part in “sustained” industrial action including the withdrawal of labour, overtime bans, work to rule measures, and bank sht bans. However, the union hopes to receive a pay offer before then.“I have yet to see anything from the Trust or the Department expressing any anxiety over it,” he added.“The ballot is not finished yet, but it would be welcomedepartment and the Trust were to give out a statement to say that they support health workers in their stance over pay parity.”With the Unison ballot closing on Monday, Mr McCarthy has warned local political parties that industrial action could coincide with the December  Westminster election, and has urged candidates to support the workers in their calls for pay parity. “We have only had one email from a local MLAin regards to discussing the issue,” he said.“We want to give a strong message to the candidates who are running for the December election, which coincides with the time we would be on strike every single MP has pay parity. “Every single MP is paid the same, but their constituents aren’t. Emma Pengelly in South Belfast is paid the same as an MP in Manchester, but her health worker constituents aren’t. “Our MPs need to support the health workers in their stance on pay parity.”A spokesperson for the Department of Health said: “The decision to adopt localised NI pay rates for health staff was taken under devolution and it is not for civil servants to overturn previous Ministerial decisions.“The claims about the Barnett Formula providing money specically for pay increases are based on a misunderstanding – this is not how public funding or the Barnett Formula work.“To be very clear there is no separate or untapped source of funding for pay.

A gun battle was raging between the military and paramilitary. He was an unwilling, innocent spectator. This personal experience, in Belfast’s Ballymurphy, was a snapshot of a society bereft of civil rights and constantly consumed with relentless violence. His interview with former Deputy First Minister, the SDLP’s Seamus Mallon, perfectly encapsulates both the tragedies of ‘The Troubles’ and the hopes for a better future. In ‘Born to Lead’ Seamus narrates a comprehensive overview of the historical triumphs of two ‘half parish’ GAA clubs – Slaughtneil, one of the greatest all-round clubs the Association has ever seen and the mighty men of Mullinalaghta, the outstanding  Leinster Senior football club champions. googletag.cmd.push This book is essentially a cameo of seventy years of Irish social, political and cultural le. It ranges from the showband era of the ’s to the splendid contribution of two present day Country music stars. Their current status emphasises the inherent value of “singing the songs of the people for the people”. Likewise, the y careers of two recently retired GAA players illustrate the importance of total dedication towards achieving personal goals. The author examines the mind set of some of his fellow alumni of St. Patrick’s College, Armagh. Insightful profiles of the legendary scoring exploits of Hogan Cup winner, Iggy Jones, and the versatility of Horslips’ Barry Devlin, are a microcosm of twelve, other gted SPCA luminaries who are also featured. All of them help immensely to make this superb book a wonderful and enjoyable read. Seamus will be launching Born to Lead in Slaughtneil Hall on Saturday, November ,  at .pm. The event is open to all and everyone is welcome.

Peerless in her own time, Oprah Winfrey, who described Angelou as a mentor said of her “Maya Angelou is not what she has done or written or spoken, it’s how she did it all. She moved through the world with unshakeable calm, confidence, and a fiery, fierce grace and abounding love.” When Dungiven woman Mary Cooke celebrated her th birthday last weekend, strangers who would have seen her in a restaurant with her family would never have guessed the depth of knowledge and character that belies the quiet exterior. googletag.cmd.push She too has moved through this world with ‘unshakeable calm, confidence and a fiery, fierce grace and abounding love’. A mother figure to all, and known widely as ‘Ma Cooke’, or now ‘Nana Cooke’ to a new generation, Mary has been caring for, and mentoring young people in her community for many years. Perhaps best known for her unstinting service to Ladies Gaelic Football in Derry and Ulster, Mary has helped progress and oversee the development of girl’s sport in her community for decades. Mary’s love of Gaelic games runs through her core like lettering in a stick of rock. A stalwart of the local Ladies Football Club, St Canice’s, her house is full of newspapers, not to be thrown out until they’ve been double checked for photos of grandchildren playing Gaelic football, soccer, hurling or camogie.  In the early years of St Canice’s Mary’s role was to wash the jerseys, a role she still retains. Indeed, The Irish News ran a competition a few years ago and Mary’s award winning photo of the club jerseys blowing in the wind at the top of Benbradagh won her a superb prize, which is was very proud of. Mary has held roles as club secretary and registrar for years, and only stepped down from her role as Child Protection Officer in the Derry Ladies County Board a couple of years ago. However, she continues to represent her club at County Board meetings, and remains the ‘go-to’ woman for help with appeals and grant application forms across the county. The Children’s Heartbeat Trust holds a special place for Mary, because of all the support given to her grandson Ryan who was born with congenital heart disease, and who went on to have a heart transplant. If you look closely at the club jersey, you will see the ‘opt for le’ logo in support of organ donation. Mary is the driving force behind the organisation of the club’s annual trip to Croke Park for All-Ireland Ladies Finals day every September, providing local children with the opportunity to experience this wonderful day out, and always hoping that the children will be inspired by their experience to go on and play for their club and county and represent their parish at the highest level one day. In Mary’s th year,  was the most memorable year for the club as St Canice’s Ladies qualied for their first ever All-Ireland Feacuteile. Mary took on the arduous role of Feacuteile officer, liaising with the club’s wonderful hosts at St Dominic’s, Roscommon, to ensure all the girls and coaches were sorted for the weekend away. ********** The daughter of Bobby and Eileen O’Neill, Mary grew up in Claudy. She was one of the last ever boarders at Thornhill, and among her many childhood friends included the mischievous Agnes McGonigleand Paula Tracey . In the late s Mary was a young civil servant, living the high le in London, but she came home to get married and have a family. Four children were born in quick succession, Donna, Tara, Tricia and Robin, all grown up now, with families of their own, and all heavily involved in local sport themselves. Civil Rights and social justice have always been key to Mary. As a young pregnant woman during the turbulent days of the early ’s Mary was stopped from going to a Civil Rights march in Derry along with her sister in law, Goretti, who was also pregnant. Her brothers hid their shoes to prevent them going! In the early s with no playschool provision for local youngsters, Mary and other like-minded Dungiven mums set up their own. She has long supported the call for local Irish Medium education provision, and has been embedded behind the scenes in the establishment of Gloacuter Dun Geimhin, enjoying the privilege of attending Irish Language lessons in the local GAA club. Sport is never far from Mary’s mind, an avid supporter of handball, camogie, hurling, soccer and football she just loves to see her community doing well. Always the first woman to design a fancy-dress costume for the parochial sports day, or hop onto the float for the parade, she always would encourage her children to take part – Mary was the driving force in her children’s, and subsequently grand-children’s love of sport. Along with her great friend Pat Farrenthey toured every county in Ireland following the Derry footballers and hurlers. Mary was often to be found sewing flags or bunting, or making hats or hair bands, flask filled, sandwiches made, and off would set Mary and Pat to support the All-Ireland winning team of  across Ireland, and beyond. Distance was no barrier for Mary’s dedication to the Oakleaf cause, she once packed the kids onto a supporters’ bus on a bitter cold January day in  and off they set for Glasgow to watch her beloved Derry boys play against Donegal at the opening of Pearse Park. A bit of bad weather or a rough sea was no deterrent for Mary Cooke and clan. Mary just loves le. She loves company, and she loves spending time with people of all ages. She possesses that ability to relate to people from all walks of le with a natural ease, that makes her the anchor to which many people tie their ship. Her calendar may have seen  summers but Mary continues to inspire and motivate those around her. Quite possibly Christy Moore’s single biggest fan in Ireland, Mary has enjoyed many live performances around the world watching the Kildare man. Famously Christy once performed in Derry’s Millennium Forum over two nights, and on the first night commented on social media how the venue organisers needed to look at the air conditioning setting as he was freezing on stage. Mary’s humour kicked in immediately, and before taking her seat in the auditorium the next night, she sweetly left a Kevin Lynch Hurling Club beanie hat with a note for Moore backstage. To everyone’s delight Christy Moore arrived onstage on the Saturday night wearing the very beanie hat given to him by Mary. Ten years ago for her th birthday the family took her to a raucous performance in the Barrowland Ballroom in Glasgow, and just last year during his performance in the famous Dublin venue, Vicar Street, the Kildare singer arrived onstage and welcomed warmly the three generations of Dungiven women to the show, as Mary sat proudly with her daughter and grand-daughter in the audience. St Canice’s Ladies GFC is blessed to have such a stalwart working on its behalf, but Mary has no intention of slowing down, far from it. Her next project is securing playing facilities for ladies’ teams in her community and knowing Mary’s track record – she will achieve it with some extra left over. I have no doubt thatMaya Angelou and Mary Cooke had ever bumped into each other at a game or a Christy Moore concert, mountains would have been moved and worlds would have been fixed.

Peerless in her own time, Oprah Winfrey, who described Angelou as a mentor said of her “Maya Angelou is not what she has done or written or spoken, it’s how she did it all. She moved through the world with unshakeable calm, confidence, and a fiery, fierce grace and abounding love.” When Dungiven woman Mary Cooke celebrated her th birthday last weekend, strangers who would have seen her in a restaurant with her family would never have guessed the depth of knowledge and character that belies the quiet exterior. googletag.cmd.push She too has moved through this world with ‘unshakeable calm, confidence and a fiery, fierce grace and abounding love’. A mother figure to all, and known widely as ‘Ma Cooke’, or now ‘Nana Cooke’ to a new generation, Mary has been caring for, and mentoring young people in her community for many years. Perhaps best known for her unstinting service to Ladies Gaelic Football in Derry and Ulster, Mary has helped progress and oversee the development of girl’s sport in her community for decades. Mary’s love of Gaelic games runs through her core like lettering in a stick of rock. A stalwart of the local Ladies Football Club, St Canice’s, her house is full of newspapers, not to be thrown out until they’ve been double checked for photos of grandchildren playing Gaelic football, soccer, hurling or camogie.  In the early years of St Canice’s Mary’s role was to wash the jerseys, a role she still retains. Indeed, The Irish News ran a competition a few years ago and Mary’s award winning photo of the club jerseys blowing in the wind at the top of Benbradagh won her a superb prize, which is was very proud of. Mary has held roles as club secretary and registrar for years, and only stepped down from her role as Child Protection Officer in the Derry Ladies County Board a couple of years ago. However, she continues to represent her club at County Board meetings, and remains the ‘go-to’ woman for help with appeals and grant application forms across the county. The Children’s Heartbeat Trust holds a special place for Mary, because of all the support given to her grandson Ryan who was born with congenital heart disease, and who went on to have a heart transplant. If you look closely at the club jersey, you will see the ‘opt for le’ logo in support of organ donation. Mary is the driving force behind the organisation of the club’s annual trip to Croke Park for All-Ireland Ladies Finals day every September, providing local children with the opportunity to experience this wonderful day out, and always hoping that the children will be inspired by their experience to go on and play for their club and county and represent their parish at the highest level one day.

It wasn’t always plain sailing at Emmet Park. Michael McMullan went to meet Graacuteinne Niacute Chathaacutein to delve into the club’s change in fortunes.----The first thing that comes into your eye-line when you enter Slaughtneil’s committee room is a picture of Aoe Niacute Chaiside hoisting the Bill and Agnes Carroll Cup aloft at Croke Park.The club’s first All-Ireland also nestles among the roll of honour emblazoned on a sign at the front of the clubhouse. There for all to see. For the youth to aspire to.It wasn’t always glory days in the shadow of Carntogher. There were lean times.  googletag.cmd.push   While the club camogs go in search of a fourth Ulster title in succession this weekend, it is another step on the journey.From being also rans, their progression transformed them into the undisputed Queens of the All-Ireland Club championship.For Graacuteinne Niacute Chathaacutein, joint captain alongside Siobhan Bradley, their pathway was a gradual one.The cornerstones were belief and work, helped by a blossoming group of players that began to knock louder on the door of destiny.With less than two weeks to another championship showdown with Loughgiel, Niacute Cathaacutein is the essence of calmness.In the adjoining building the underage hurling management teams gather to take stock on the season and plant the seeds for .The camogie story is similar. No secrets, just organised graft.“It was years of hard work,” Niacute Chathaacutein offers, of how Slaughtneil’s camogie has morphed into national dominance.Committed. Dedicated.Two words she uses to describe the girls she has battled with.After living in the shadow of Eoghan Rua and going home empty-handed, it was time to change.“We came together as a group and decided we needed to do something, that we had to put in the extra work we hadn’t been doing,” she recalls of the period ‘in and around’ their first county title in .“We thought something has to change, where we have to step it up a gear, to decide we are either taking it serious or not.”A lack of belief was holding them back. Slowly but surely that changed. Under PJ O’Mullan, the current Loughgiel manager, Damien McEldowney and Dympna Dougan they finally got over the line.“Winning that first Derry title and it still is one of the best titles we have won, personally. It was a great achievement,” the Emmet’s defender adds.After a heavy defeat in Ulster at the hands of Antrim champions Rossa, they relinquished their hold on the Derry championship for the next two seasons.“Getting beat is a learning curve, as much as winning. Every match you have things to learn and improve, to go back to the drawing board after.“After those couple of defeats, we decided we’d rather be winning and we had the calibre of players. The management changed and were happy to put in the effort and that really started the winning .“Damien , Mickey , Woody , Shaunand now Padraig , with Thomasalso being on board….it was a great bunch of management in recent years.”After living on the outskirts of success, looking in, Slaughtneil are now on the other side. They are now the envy and the hunted.“With experience, learning and a bit of confidence in ourselves as a team, I would say that has developed and filtered in through everybody. Once you get that….it’s harder to back down.”The new generation breaking into the team had their share of success at underage level. Graacuteinne Niacute Chathaacutein played on a ‘strong’ side on her way up through the ranks - namechecking Jolene Bradley, Cara Cassidy, Mary Kelly, Siobhan Bradley, Eiliacutes and Aoe Niacute Chaiside among those she hurled with.“We were getting to championship finals. We weren’t always winning but we were fortunate to be one of the strongest teams throughout underage. The younger girlshad been on the winning end of things.”After getting to the pinnacle, the appetite for success is a motivator. With other teams hot on their heels, the Slaughtneil mantra is about continued improvement. Both collectively and on an inidual basis.“Among ourselves, we were more competitive with one another because you know there are only  places and everybody wants to be making that team, which is great.“The underage players that have come through are always stepping up. Every year, there are new players coming on board and they are always willing to put in the work…fighting for their places and that keeps everybody on their toes.”One constant in Slaughtneil’s rise has been Loughgiel, the last team to beat them in the championship – a - to - Ulster Final defeat in .Niacute Cathaacutein terms them as “our old friends,” with both teams knowing each other inside out.“They are a good bunch of girls and like ourselves, are hardworking and are good camogie players. It is a great thing for Ulster camogie with the two teams and you are guaranteed a good match between us.“Loughgiel are a great team and they were the last team to beat us. There is never anything between us. They have lost players this year but so have we. It will be interesting to see how it goes.”The defeat of four years ago is rarely talked about but sits close enough to the surface to always be remembered. Even in the face of all the recent success, that memory is always enough to sharpen the focus.The epic games they have been involved in have helped shape their character. Clawing their way back from the jaws of defeat to force a replay, before Mary Kelly’s winning goal secured a first Ulster.The battle with Thomastown in Inniskeen, the resolve to win the All-Ireland after the final was twice called off due to snow and last year clinching the three-in-a-row.“That mental strength to come back time and time again is good,” offers Niacute Chathaacutein. “It is something we know we are good at. We keep going to the bitter end, no matter how dficult the task is and Loughgiel is another task ahead.”It is not a matter of nerves.“As a team, we are pretty composed and we would always focus on staying in control of our emotions. Getting nervous is always a good thing, it shows that you actually care.”After years of nothing, following by unrivalled success, the battle for supremacy continues.

street.There are real fears that with the Christmas rush just around the corner, more and more pirate traders will be moving into the Downpatrick area in search of rich pickings.Several traders have

shopkeepers.This week Down councillors decided to wage war on the pirates and legal action against one of them is to be brought before Downpatrick court next week.Chief public health officer, Mr Frank Nixon, said several of his staff had visited the area on a number of occasions and warned stallholders about illegal trading, but it still continued over a six-week period.On one occasion, Mr Nixon,

In addition, he wants the education body to restore crumbling farm buildings which it owns at the country park.His call for action comes as work continues to overhaul and extend the Education Authorityrsquos base at Delamont which is used to deliver a iety of outdoor purists courses.Several years ago, the building was earmarked for closure as part of a rationalisation of outdoor youth provision, but it secured a reprieve as a result of pressure from local politicians.Cllr Burgess believes there are opportunities for the local council and the Education Authority to work in partnership in key areas to help transform Delamont.ldquoThere is so much that could be done and, like many others, I am looking forward to seeing the detail of the development blueprint when it is published, he continued.ldquoThere is a small harbour area located at the Island Road adjacent to the county park which the council is responsible for. Upgrading this facility would further enhance what Delamont has to offer.Cllr Burgess said while the -acre country park already attracts tens of thousands of visitors every year, it had the capacity to do much more.The park already boasts a hugely popular miniature railway, cafe and stunning walks but the Rowallane politician said it should be offering so much more.ldquoI am aware of ious ideas which have been suggested which include a pitch and putt course, bowling green, water sports facility, dedicated camping site and disc golf and a venue for outdoor concerts.ldquoWhile the ious ideas have merit, it is important that nothing is done which would have a negative impact on the aesthetics of the country park.Cllr Burgess said it was clear from his discussions with council officials that they were committed to enhancing what Delamont has to offer to help attract even more visitors to what he described as a ldquostunning facility which is already used to host a number of international events, including the annual Skfies Festival.He added: ldquoDelamont is a jewel in our tourism crown.

The party enjoyed a major increase in its local council election vote earlier this year with party officials hoping that that success will be repeated next month. In , Alliance candidate Andrew McMurray polled , votes.Mr Hazzard says the election is an opportunity to reject the ldquoreckless Tory DUP Brexit and drive forward momentum for Irish unity.ldquoSinn Feacutein is ready for the election and to seize the opportunity to unseat Brexiteer DUP MPs across the north, he declared.ldquoIn the last Westminster election, the nationalist people sent a powerful message by turning its back on Westminster and ing seven Sinn Feacutein MPs, including an historic victory in South Down.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoGiven the catastrophe that Westminster is attempting to force upon our island it is vital that people here in South Down continue to show Dublin, Europe and the world that we still reject Brexit, borders and the DUP.Describing the Westminster poll as a ldquodefining election, Mr Savage said that local people deserved more than an empty seat in parliament.He declared: ldquoBrexit is a national emergency. It threatens people, jobs and businesses across this island and at a time of immense crisis, itrsquos just not good enough that our current MP has decided to abstain on this islandrsquos future.ldquoBoris Johnson, the DUP and others are delighted that itrsquos one less vote against their plans to privatise our health service and sell large chunks off to American profiteers.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things.

However, party sources have said that will not happen. The DUP is attempting to use the election as a springboard for the restoration of Stormont andMrs Foster was to get elected to Westminster she would have to quit Stormont, a move which would suggest she did not think devolution was ing.The front-runner is believed to be local MLA Carla Lockhart.Ms Lockhart topped the poll when she was first elected as an MLA in  and then increased her vote to again top the poll in , despite that being a disastrous election campaign for the DUP in which it lost  MLAs after the RHI scandal.Fellow MLA Jonny Buckley, who was first elected to the Assembly in , is also believed to be in the frame. Mr Buckley is highly regarded within the party and was just  when elected as an MLA. However, in the absence of any ing Assembly he has yet to even speak in the chamber.The other candidate rumoured to be interested is MEP Diane Dodds. She lives in Banbridge in the constituency and will be losing her MEP role in JanuaryBrexit happens then.One factor in favour of Mrs Lockhart and Mrs Dodds is that the DUP’s sole female MP, Emma Little-Pengelly, is likely to lose her seat in South Belfast and it may not want an all-male group of MPs ed to Westminster.Mrs Dodds and her husband are two of the DUP party officers. When askedthey would play any part in the selection process, a DUP spokesman would only say: “The party has a process in place for the selection of a candidate to fight the election in Upper Bann.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But our role as judges in this case is limited.\"The wider issues raised by the claimants, about whether these choices were right or wrong or good or bad, are not for us they are for members of the public and their elected representatives.\"There was no direct discrimination on grounds of sex, because this legislation does not treat women less favourably than men in law.\"Rather, it equalises a historic asymmetry between men and women and thereby corrects historic direct discrimination against men.\"In a statement after the ruling, Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: \"This is a terrible blow for the millions of women who will have been hoping for a very dferent outcome today.\"The decision to hike the state pension age with next to no notice didnt just throw their retirement plans up in the air, it also left many women on lower incomes really struggling to make ends meet.\"Campaigners have now called on the UK Parliament to intervene on their behalf.A DWP spokesman welcomed the judgment, adding: \"It has always been our view that the changes we made to womens state pension age were entirely lawful and did not discriminate on any grounds.\"The court decided that arguments the claimants were not given adequate notice of changes to the state pension age could not be upheld.\"This follows the extensive communications that DWP made to publicise these changes over many years.\"He added that raising the state pension age in line with changes to le expectancy had been the policy of successive governments over many years. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents.

I agree we need change, but going by the small number of people who actually wanted this it strikes me as something pushed through.ldquoFrom my perspective - and that of other residents here - the council could have been far more open and communicative during the process.Mike Clogg, Vale council operational manager for neighbourhood services and transport, said: ldquoThe council consulted widely on these proposals from May  to July  last year, a process that allowed residents to have their say by responding to the online survey, writing to the council or attending one of two drop-in sessions held at Belle Vue Pavilion.ldquoFour potential routes were proposed before this one was selected, a decision that was reached after  per cent of survey respondents identied this as their first or second choice.ldquoThe views of other interested parties were also considered, while there was also signicant media coverage on the matter.ldquoIt is dficult to please everyone when it comes to highway improvement schemes, but this project should be of major benefit to Penarth, improving traffic flow and reducing congestion.ldquoIt is part of a wider scheme of work involving building a new skate park at Penarth Leisure Centre and improvements to The Dingle Park.ldquoIt is hoped the scheme will encourage more people to walk to these locations and provide children with a safer route to the leisure centre and local schools.ldquoImprovements to the junction will also create a more attractive entrance to Penarth, while new plants, railings and public art will improve the appearance of The Dingle Park. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, we got Frank Collict, a local artist in to do another card - this time a painting of Penarth Pier in the snow.All the profits from the cards go to the Tabernacle Church foodbank. After last years run was paid for out of pocket by Mr Hole, he sought a sponsor, and found one in the form of Welsh energy supplier Our Footprints, who have covered the costs of printing and advertising in full.\"Theyve been fantastic - thanks to them,  per cent of the profits are going to the food bank,\" said Mr Hole.\"I moved back to Penarth three years ago after suffering a breakdown in Brighton. The foodbank there was essential in getting me back on my feet.\"Every Thursday they do drop ins for people to pick up parcels, and do social breakfast mornings. Its a brilliant place run by volunteers and Im just happy to do something to give back to them.\"Theres also a memorial on the back to a friend of mine who passed away this year, as a mark of respect to him and his husband.\"Cards can be brought from Snells, Four Ways Newsagents and Gts and Number Nine from the beginning of November for pound.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

OlympicsThe  year old Lurgan girls are still on a high after their success in Dublin at the weekend.The pair were part of the team which beat Canada and thrust the team to the Olympics in Tokyo next year.Both girls, daughters of Dr Dickie and Janice Barr, have been steeped in hockey most of their le and were part of the Lurgan College All Ireland winning team.Indeed, while both have just finished university, they did their degrees in the USA with hockey scholarships.Later Beth just completed Masters jointly at Dublin’s UCD and Trinity in International Development while Serena completed Masters in Dietetics in Leeds Bradford.Both girls, who play for Harlequins, only made their Ireland debut this year and were crucial to winning the qualying game against Canada.Beth spoke of how their love of hockey was inspired by a teacher at Waringstown Primary School, Audrey McCollum.“She got us started and we have been playing hockey ever since,” said Bethany. “It has brought us a lot of joy over the years.”She said they are just delighted at the win last weekend and are looking forward to going to Tokyo.Bethany revealed that they will be spending the next few months training with their local club and then in January training for Tokyo will begin, including warm weather training.Bethany is now working for Latin Link, a Belfast-based mission charity which does a lot of work in Latin America.She reveals that she is lucky to be able to work part time at the charity and also work part time with hockey.“Only for the sponsors, we wouldn’t be able to do it. We are only part time but other big teams like GB and Holland are on full time programmes,” she said.She said she was overwhelmed by the great support, particularly last weekend in Donnybrook, Dublin at the final.And she was full of praise for her parents Dr Dickie and Janice Barr. “Dad rarely misses a game.

They are also forbidden to wear any colours associated with a political party, such as blue, red, or yellow, and cannot discuss politics with the public, in case it influences their vote.RunnersRunners take the filled ballot boxes from polling stations and deliver them to the location where they will be counted - often a large sports hall.Their job begins once the polls have closed at pm, and after the last person at each polling station has voted.Counting AssistantsCounting assistants are needed from around midnight until the early hours of the morning, and are responsible for collecting the boxes of ballots from the runners and counting them.On rare occasions, they may also be required to recount the ballots in cases where the result is too close to call.How much can I earn There is no set amount that councils pay for election roles, but many offer more than £ to prospective polling clerks and presiding officers.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
