The economy has got a long uphill struggle.\u0027 The Mail revealed earlier this week how the Prime Minister is \u0027extremely concerned\u0027 about the possibility a second spike of infections could start in the next two weeks. His remarks in recent days come in stark contrast to his message a fortnight ago when he expressed hope that all social distancing restrictions may be ditched in time for Christmas.Yesterday, Mr Johnson insisted Britain has had \u0027massive success\u0027 in bringing down mortality rates but warned: \u0027I have to tell you we\u0027re looking at a resurgence of the virus in some other European countries, you can see what\u0027s been happening in the United States.\u0027So it is absolutely vital as a country we continue to keep our focus and discipline, and that we don\u0027t delude ourselves that somehow we\u0027re out of the woods or that this is all over, because it isn\u0027t all over.\u0027Despite the rise in the level of infections, the numbers are still way below the peak on May 1 when 6,201 cases were confirmed in just one day.Mr Smith, whose Crawley constituency includes Gatwick Airport, last night said: \u0027Testing should play a much larger role in giving people confidence to travel.\u0027Do I have to cancel my wedding? Can I still celebrate Eid? Your questions answered as 4.5million people in Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Yorkshire are hit by new lockdownWhat has the Government announced?Health Secretary Matt Hancock last night that people from different households in Greater Manchester, parts of east Lancashire and West Yorkshire will be banned from meeting each other in their homes and in their gardens from midnight.Which areas are affected?The new restrictions apply to the whole of Greater Manchester, parts of east Lancashire including Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle and Rossendale as well as Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees in West Yorkshire.The same restrictions will also apply to Leicester, which saw the first so-called \u0027local lockdown\u0027 imposed on June 29.What does this mean for the people living there?The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that the new measures will mean people in these areas will not be permitted to mix with other households outside those in their support bubbles in private homes or gardens.Households will be able to go to bars, pubs and other hospitality venues but two households should not go together, the department added.The DHSC said that restrictions currently in place in Blackburn which saw indoor swimming pools, indoor fitness and dance studios, indoor gyms and sports facilities remaining closed will continue.Why is this being done?In a series of tweets Mr Hancock said that there had been an increasing rate of transmission in parts of Northern England.He said that this was due to \u0027households gathering and not abiding by the social distancing rules\u0027 and the new rules were being put in place in order to \u0027keep the country safe\u0027.How will the restrictions be enforced?The Government said it will sign new regulations to make the changes \u0027legally enforceable\u0027 and will give local authorities and police forces the powers to enforce these restrictions.How fast is the virus spreading?According to the most recent figures from Public Health England (PHE) the rate of infection is increasing across 13 of the 19 local authorities in the areas where the new measures are being imposed.In Blackburn with Darwen, the rate has risen from 83.3 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to July 20 to 89.3 in the seven days to July 27. A total of 133 new cases have been recorded.Leicester has the second highest seven-day rate despite it falling from 67.8 per 100,000 people to 60.2 over the same period, with 214 new cases.Over the same period the rate has also increased in Manchester, Burnley, Pendle, Bradford, Calderdale, Oldham, Bury, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan, but fell in Hyndburn, Rossendale, Kirklees, Bolton and Rochdale.Rochdale, Oldham, Blackburn and Pendle have been on a PHE watchlist as an \u0027area of concern\u0027 after elevated rates of infection.What is happening in Leicester?The DHSC said that from Monday restaurants, cafes, bars and hairdressers in Leicester can open again in line with the easing of restrictions across the rest of the country on July 4.Leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed but cinemas and museums will open and religious ceremonies will be able to take place, it added.The department said that all local restrictions currently in place in the neighbouring borough of Oadby and Wigston will end.But Mr Hancock said that the restrictions on social gatherings imposed on Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and West Yorkshire would also apply to the city of Leicester.Does my household include close family members?Your household – as defined in law – is only the people you live with. If you have formed a support bubble (which must include a single adult household i.e. people who live alone or single parents with dependent children aged under 18) these can be treated as if they are members of your household.What will be illegal?It will be illegal for people who do not live together to meet in a private home or garden, except for limited exceptions to be set out in law. You should not host or visit people you do not live with, unless they are in your support bubble. If you live in the affected areas, you should not visit someone\u0027s home or garden regardless of whether this is in or outside of the restricted area.Can I still meet indoors with people in my support bubble?Yes. Where people from single adult households (people who live alone or single parents with dependent children aged under 18) have formed a support bubble with another household, they can continue to visit each other, stay overnight, and visit other public places as if they were one household.Can I still meet people outdoors?In line with the national guidance, you can continue to meet in public outdoor spaces in groups of no more than six people, unless the group includes only people from two households. You cannot meet people you do not live within a private garden.At all times, you should socially distance from people you do not live with – unless they are in your support bubble.I live in this area. Can I still meet with my family and friends to celebrate Eid?Due to higher rates of infection, if you live in this area you should not host or visit friends and family in each other\u0027s homes or gardens. It will shortly be illegal to do so, unless specific exemptions apply. You also should not meet friends and family in other venues – including restaurants or cafes.Up to two households, or six people from any number of households may meet outdoors (excluding people\u0027s gardens) where there is a lower risk of infection. If you do so, you should still socially distance from those you do not live with, and avoid physical contact.You may attend a mosque or other place or worship, where Covid-19 Secure guidance applies, but you must socially distance from people outside of your household. This means maintaining a distance of 2 metres, or 1 metre with mitigations (such as wearing face coverings). We recommend at this time that, if possible, prayerreligious services take place outdoors.Can I still go to work in this area?Yes. People living inside and outside of this area can continue to travel in and out for work. Workplaces must implement Covid-19 Secure guidance.I live in this area. Can I still go to cafes, restaurants, the gym and other public places?Yes. But you should only go with members of your own household – even if you are going outside of the restricted area.I live in the area. Can people from outside of the lockdown area visit me at my house?No. This will be illegal.Do I still have to shield if I live in this area?Clinically extremely vulnerable people will no longer have to follow the shielding guidance from the 1 August, unless they live in Blackburn with Darwen in the North West and other local affected areas across England where shielding continues.Can I visit a care home?You should not visit friends or family in care homes, other than in exceptional circumstances. Care homes should restrict visits to these circumstances.Can I still have my wedding if it\u0027s in the lockdown area?Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies in these areas can still go ahead. No more than 30 people should attend a marriage or civil partnership, where this can be safely accommodated with social distancing in a COVID-19 secure venue. Further guidance can be found here.Large wedding receptions or parties should not currently be taking place and any celebration after the ceremony should follow the broader social distancing guidance of involving no more than two households in any location or, if outdoors, up to six people from different households.Can I travel outside of the lockdown area to attend a wedding ceremony?Yes.Can I travel into the lockdown area to attend a wedding ceremony?Yes. Weddings should be limited to no more than 30 people and subject to COVID-19 Secure guidelines.People living outside the lockdown areas may travel into the areas to attend a wedding, but should not go into a private home or garden.Can I still visit a place of worship in the lockdown area?Yes, but you must socially distance from people outside of your household. This means maintaining a distance of 2 metres, or 1 metre with mitigations (e.g. face coverings). We recommend at this time that if possible prayerreligious services take place outdoors.Can funerals still take place in the lockdown areas?Yes. Funerals should be limited to no more than 30 people and subject to COVID-19 Secure guidelines.People living outside the lockdown areas may travel into the areas to attend a funeral.Can I holiday in the lockdown area, or visit shops, leisure facilities, or cafes in it?Yes. However, you must avoid socialising with people indoors when doing so.Can I travel in a car with someone I do not live with?You should try not to share a vehicle with those outside your household or social bubble.

Experts have warned that the widespread confusion and mixed messages could contribute to a second wave of the virus.They suggested that Downing Street\u0027s decision to end the daily press briefings at the end of June means people are less informed and more confused. Lead author Dr Daisy Fancourt, from University College London, said: \u0027This could possibly reflect difficulties in applying the rules to more complex life scenarios amongst younger adults, or may be reflective of the different amounts of time spent following the news on Covid-19 amongst different age groups.\u0027The general drop-off in understanding could be due to unclear messaging from the Government, or a reduction in interest and engagement from people, especially with the cessation of the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing in late June.\u0027And on Wednesday the head of the British Medical Association, Chaand Nagpaul, told MPs: \u0027If I look at something as simple as our messages on social distancing, we\u0027re told that social distancing is still two metres, or one metre plus. \u0027Do you think any member of the public understands what one metre plus means?

I have left room to imply that there are more names to come.On a number of levels, I was very keen to support Patrick Vernon’s fund. From a personal perspective, as a family we have a huge debt of gratitude to the NHS. The Homerton ICU in London saved my daughter’s life. Before Christmas, we spent five weeks in intensive care with my daughter, who was on a ventilator with pneumonia. The ICU staff at the Homerton became like family to us, and when Covid-19 hit we felt intensely worried and upset for them, especially knowing how many fantastic BAME members of staff there were and how much more they were at risk.I have been appalled by the government’s handling of the crisis and the unnecessary deaths caused by lack of PPE, planning and the late lockdown and, ultimately, the systemic racism that has caused so many unnecessary deaths.

Rita was 17 when the photojournalist Lizzie Sadin photographed her. A year before, she was living with her family near the foothills of the Himalayas. A friend told her of a life of opportunity lying in wait in India, just a few hundred miles away. After crossing the border from Nepal, Rita was captured, imprisoned and forced into a life of sex work for visiting tourists. Rita’s eyes blaze into the airy calm of Porquerolles island.In 2017, Sadin, a former social worker in Paris’s périphérique, was the Carmignac photojournalism awards’ eighth winning laureate. On the basis of a two-page pitch, she received a €50,000 (£45,000) grant. She used the money to embed herself, with her camera hidden beneath her coat, in the shady dance bars of the Nepalese borderlands, capturing stories of modern-day slavery.Sadin is one of 10 photojournalists to receive such backing over the course of the last decade. To mark this milestone, Fondation Carmignac is exhibiting each laureate’s work in a retrospective titled 10 Years of Reportage, on show until 1 November 2020.With Rita’s eyes at its centre, the show is curated to urgently explore some of the biggest existential questions we face – the hidden truths of modern slavery, the cost of endless conflict, the consequences of habitat loss and the quest of freedom for those living under authoritarianism.“I came to Libya to document the humanitarian crisis of migrants trying to reach Europe through Libyan territory,” says Narciso Contreras. “But, actually, what I found is a market.”From February to June 2016, the Mexican photographer travelled through Libya after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi.He captured how Libya has become a human marketplace in which destitute migrants are bought and sold as they attempt to make their way to Europe.Contreras uses the exhibition to show the first images – taken on his iPhone – of a transaction taking place between traffickers, which helped NGO groups affiliated with Carmignac prove modern slavery was taking place in Libya.Contreras concluded that, far from trying to resolve the situation, “Libyan authorities were running, and profiting from”, the trafficking of people.Arctic: New Frontier – Yuri Kozyrev and Kadir van Lohuizen, 2018If you’re planning to visit the north pole, it might be a good idea to get a move on. On the basis of all authoritative forecasts, the ice of the Arctic will be gone by 2030, to be replaced by a water world created by anthropogenic global warming.Never before have two photojournalists simultaneously covered the irreversible changes that are taking place in the Arctic. That is until Yuri Kozyrev and Kadir van Lohuizen, working in coordination, created Arctic: New Frontier in 2018.Kozyrev followed the routes of the Russian Arctic ports, from the city of Murmansk to the Taymyr peninsula and the islands of the Russian Arctic. Van Lohuizen, meanwhile, started in the Svalbard Archipelago and followed the northern Arctic route through Greenland, Canada and the northern tip of Alaska. Each captured the expansion of the region’s ports, industrial forces and military sites – “a process that will change the map of the world forever”, Kozyrev says.The New Zealand-born photographer Robin Hammond calls Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe “a garden of Eden that became a hell to many of its inhabitants”. In the processing of taking portraits of Zimbabwe’s pro-democracy activists, Hammond was imprisoned twice. “They wanted to show me the terrible living conditions they have to endure,” he says. “But some were afraid for me, and warned me of the danger.”His portraits include the face of the activist Masvingo, staring out from a pool of darkness. Hammond hides his body, severely burnt after soldiers threw a can of lit petrol into a campaign office for Zimbabwe’s Movement for Democratic Change.Iran: Blank Pages of an Iranian Photo Album – Newsha Tavakolian, 2014In 2015, Tavakolian became the first female photographer from the Middle East to join Magnum, the photography collective. The year before, she was the Carmignac laureate for a body of work that explored, via moving and still image, the personal stories of her own generation – the Iranian millennials who have grown up in Tehran after the 1979 revolution and the country’s bloody war with Iraq.As a self-taught photographer, and when still a teenager, she took to the streets to photograph the 1999 student uprising in Iran, “spending a week scaling trees with a zoom lens” while militia marched through the streets.Her series here captures nine men and women, shot in and around Tehran, as they communicate the tension of “being marginalised by those speaking in their name”, Tavakolian says. In Iran, “they try to fit into a landscape they regard as not being their own. They, like many of the others they represent, adapt.”Seen together, the Carmignac Foundation’s retrospective is a stark reminder, in the midst of the bucolic beauty of the French Riviera, of the first world’s increasing responsibility to the poverty, oppression and vulnerability that is the daily reality for most people in this world.Carmignac Photojournalism Award: 10 Years of Reportage is on show until 1 November 2020 at Villa Carmignac, Porquerolles"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94a609aea440a248512a7b5309886c72674b2a1e/2_0_5902_3543/master/5902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a128a16e4689d3ad7d51e7b7723f4041","title":"being inbetween girls of our time in pictures","story":"A series documenting and exploring the lives of girls aged between 10 and 12 a time of transition between girlhood and young adulthood.

The group made a €1.1bn profit in the first half of last year.Willie Walsh, IAG’s chief executive, expects it to take until at least 2023 for passenger demand to reach the pre-coronavirus levels of 2019.“All IAG airlines made substantial losses,” Walsh said. “Each airline has taken actions to adjust their business and reduce their cost base to reflect forecast demand in their markets.”The half-year operating loss included €2.2bn of exceptional costs relating to the early retirement of British Airways’ Boeing 747s and Iberia’s Airbus A340s, as well as costs relating to its fuel-hedging programme.“We are nowhere close to where we had hoped to be as a result of the continuing restrictions that government has introduced,” said Walsh, speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.Walsh said he expected an increase in these numbers when restrictions were lifted.“Domestic markets recover much more quickly than international markets,” he said. “When restrictions are removed there is very clear evidence of pent-up demand and passengers do start flying again.”He added that the quarantine restrictions introduced for travellers flying to Spain had not discouraged customers flying to other parts of Europe.The group has so far refunded more than £1bn to customers but Walsh admitted it could have moved more quickly. A Civil Aviation Authority review of airlines’ performance on refunds released on Thursday said that test calls to British Airways terminated after a recorded message had played out.Walsh said: “It is important for us to acknowledge that we have disappointed people and not been able to refund people as quickly as we would like.“The scale of this challenge goes beyond anything we have seen before and we just weren’t prepared for it. We are significantly improving the time we refund customers. We are aiming to get back to seven days. We are currently running at an average of 14 days.” He added that much of the refund process still has to be done manually.British Airways employs about 45,000 staff and has more than half of these on furlough.

It may be easier to just buy a supermarketSupermarkets have been waiting several years for Amazon to make its next move in the UK’s near-£200bn food retail market and it came this week when the American company revealed plans to expand its online grocery service Amazon Fresh.Amazon has already won over millions of Britons with the rapid-fire delivery of books, toys and household essentials to their front door, and coronavirus lockdowns have made it a lifeline for some households.Fresh has operated with little fanfare in London and the home counties for several years but the online retailer has promised wider availability by the end of 2020, including in major cities such as Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh.To win over shoppers, Amazon is offering the service as a new perk to the estimated 15 million Britons that are paid up members of its Prime membership scheme, which offers extras such as faster delivery and streaming services for a £79 annual fee.“Grocery delivery is one of the fastest-growing businesses at Amazon,” said Russell Jones, country manager, Amazon Fresh UK. “We will keep improving the grocery shopping experience so by the end of the year, millions of Prime members across the UK will have access to fast, free delivery of groceries.”The move is timed to capitalise on new shopping habits forged during the pandemic when many households opted to buy their groceries online for the first time. Ocado recently revealed it had a waiting list of 1 million customers after its automated warehouses struggled to cope with the huge surge in demand.Amazon brought the Fresh service over from the US in 2016 and the following year caused a storm when it spent more than £10bn on organic food chain Whole Foods Market. But instead of going it alone here Amazon has put together its food range through partnerships with homegrown chains including Morrisons and upmarket regional chain Booths.Relationships with the manufacturers of major grocery brands such as Pepsi, Cadbury and Heinz means the Fresh service carries “tens of thousands of products” – a selection comprehensive enough for a weekly shop.“Amazon is going to have to work incredibly hard to dislodge people’s loyalty to their existing supermarket,” says Bryan Roberts, an independent retail analyst. “Depending where you live people are either Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda or Morrisons shoppers and when they go online are more likely to buy from those retailers because they’re familiar with the range and the pricing and the private label.”He adds: “One of the big things everyone is ignoring is that grocery home delivery is brilliant at the moment but that’s because everyone is at home. Fast forward 12 to-18 months, that isn’t always going to be the case.”Amazon has 14 depots capable of handling groceries around the country and says it has expanded its fulfilment network in key locations to handle the expected customer demand. But analysts think it does not have adequate infrastructure to offer a competitive grocery delivery service nationwide. Yet.Last year, the proposed merger of Sainsbury’s and Asda was blocked by the competition watchdog, which argued that the proposed £7bn deal threatened to push up prices and reduce the choice and quality of products on sale in stores. There has been no deal action since then. Analysts think if Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, wants to make waves here it will have to buy an incumbent, with Walmart-owned Asda or Morrisons the most likely targets.“Amazon is probably going to be the next key player in any consolidation in the industry, particularly if, as it as it decided in the USA, that the only real way to move to the right in groceries is to buy a store estate,” says Clive Black, an analyst at stockbroker Shore Capital.“Asda is for sale and the big American private equity firms are looking at it, so we can’t rule that out even though Walmart and Amazon are going head to head in the states at the moment. They also have a formal relationship with Morrisons.”Ocado ZoomOnly available to a limited number of postcodes from a small site in west London (second planned for north London).

Households are upgrading as more companies either continue to delay sending staff back to the office or make remote working a permanent fixture.“It is part of that general trend of connectivity being seen as absolutely crucial, even more crucial than it was before because there are more people at home, kids studying online, gaming, work and all that.”Boris Johnson has pledged to have next-generation broadband made available to every home by 2025, as the UK plays catch up rolling out the technology compared with most developed markets around the world. BT is spending £12bn rolling out full-fibre broadband to 20m homes by the late 2020s.On Friday, BT revealed a near-£400m decline in revenue in the three months to the end of June.

From their report:The talks began in recent months after Nvidia approached SoftBank, which has been pursuing a series of other asset sales, about a potential acquisition. There is no guarantee that the discussions will result in a sale, the people cautioned, adding there were a number of issues pertaining to a deal that would need to be resolved.Buying Arm would further consolidate Nvidia’s position at the centre of the semiconductor industry, at just the moment when the British chip designer’s technology is finding broader applications beyond mobile devices, in data centres and personal computers including Apple’s Macs.

JJAnother big loss for an oil supermajor, ExxonMobil, if not quite on the scale of Shell’s $18bn stonker from yesterday.Exxon on Friday said it had lost $1.1bn (£840m) in the second quarter, compared to $3.1bn in 2019.It cut $2bn of previously planned spending as it adjusted to lower oil prices and slumping demand as economies around the world locked down.However, the headlien Exxon figures were helped by a non-cash gain from inventory valuation adjustment, due to rising commodity prices over the quarter, of $1.9bn.Jaguar Land Rover, Britain’s largest carmaker by volume, lost £413m between April and June as the pandemic caused a slump in sales and cost it £1.1bn in plant shutdowns.JLR, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, will also accelerate a cost-cutting programme, seeking another £1bn in savings by March 2021. It will aim for total cost savings of £2.5bn over the year, or £6bn in all since the cost-cutting was first started in 2018.The carmaker has been cutting back spending - including ending the contracts of 1,000 agency workers - as it ploughs money into new cars such as the Land Rover Defender as well as battery electric technology.Ralf Speth, Jaguar Land Rover’s chief executive, who will move to a non-executive vice chairman role in September, said:Jaguar Land Rover has reacted with resilience and agility to the extraordinary challenges faced in the first three months of the new fiscal year, adapting rapidly to thewidespread macro-economic disruption and uncertainty facing our industry.As the lockdowns ease, we will emerge from the pandemic with our most advanced product line-up yet, and with the financial and operating measures in place to return to long-term sustainable profit.Boris Johnson has announced that the UK will slow down its efforts to reopen the economy, saying we should squeeze the brake pedal.That could have an impact on hopes for a “V-shaped “ economic recovery for the UK.He has postponed the reopening of some higher-risk settings, including some types of beauty treatment.Face coverings will become mandatory in more settings, including museums, cinemas, galleries and places of worship.For the UK, one of the big news stories of the past 24 hours is last night’s reimposition of some lockdown measures on parts of northern England, including Manchester.Boris Johnson is due to make new lockdown announcements. You can follow here:An interesting bit of news from the UK’s banking conduct regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, which has said that banks might have to offer “sustainable forebearance” for customers struggling because of the pandemic.Forebearance means customers being allowed longer to pay off their loans without interest charges mounting up.Regulators stepped in to make sure banks gave customers leeway at the start of the crisis, but it appears to be looking at longer-term options. That could eventually affect banks’ profits if they are unable to charge things like overdraft fees.On Friday the FCA asked banks about their possible new approach,Britain’s banks may need to consider introducing “sustainable forbearance” for customers who continue to face difficulties with loan repayments after Covid-19 relief measures end in the autumn, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Friday.The watchdog launched a “call for input” to determine what further measures may be needed when repayment holidays introduced after the pandemic lockdown for home loans and credit cards come to an end on Oct. 31.Banks have provided more than 1.8 million mortgage payment deferrals and in excess of 1.6 million personal loan and credit card payment holidays, the FCA said.Though the FCA expects most borrowers to be able to resume payments, it said that a significant minority will need further support after many also borrowed from family and friends to keep up payments on other loans.“We consider that the appropriate time for firms to move beyond blanket deferrals is at the end of the customer’s second deferral,” the FCA said.The government’s official statistics body has acknowledged that the UK’s train system has effectively been nationalised after the emergency bailouts at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.The Office for National Statistics on Friday said that the train operating companies no longer qualified as private-sector entities for the purposes of international statistics guidelines.The emergency deal between the government and the train companies transferred almost all revenue and cost risk from the companies to the government, the ONS said. At the same time, train companies are not allowed to make schedule changes or change staffing numbers without specific government approval. Although it does not have any legal effects, it means the train companies’ borrowing and debts will be counted as public sector borrowing from now until they are given more control again. The companies’ employees will also be added to public sector employment figures. After reviewing their classification against international statistical guidelines, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has concluded that those train operating companies (TOCs) that have entered into emergency measures agreements (EMAs) with the UK and Scottish governments should be classified to the public sector for statistical purposes. The change, which affects statistics going back to 1 April, has been communicated to the Treasury and the Scottish government.Could the eurozone and US data have a bearing on the UK economy? Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee and a senior adviser to Cambridge Econometrics, wonders if the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, may have been too pessimistic in its forecasts. The fall in eurozone GDP is so big that it is difficult to put it into historical context.Bert Colijn, senior economist for the eurozone at ING investment bank, said:Some records are never to be beaten. Think of Alan Shearer’s Premier League goals, Wilt Chamberlain’s 100 point basketball game, Eddy Merckx’s victories in cycling. The second quarter eurozone GDP figure should probably go on that list as well it would be great if it were never to be beaten.Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy, said: There are few silver linings in the data published today, which confirm that euro-zone GDP slumped just as much as feared in the second quarter and that inflation remained well below target. While parts of the economy have sprung back to life over the past couple of months, the damage already done combined with the current and potential future impact of the virus mean that the recovery will be painfully slow. Spain, which has suffered one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks worldwide, also saw the deepest contraction in the second quarter among eurozone nations.The deepest GDP fall since time series started in 1995 coincided with Covid-19-induced lockdowns that began to ease in many eurozone countries only from May.There are some more notes of caution on the house price rise from economists.It is easy to see why some expect prices to drop again, given the unemployment surge expected by many. Here is a measure of house price affordability for UK workers: the drop during the financial crisis is evident, but so far there is little sign of a much deeper recession.The UK housing market is a strange beast, with the added complication of foreign speculative flows - although this crisis might conceivably affect buyers from abroad.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said:Meanwhile, the supply of homes coming on to the market likely will increase in the winter, once mortgage payment holidays of up to six months for struggling households come to an end, pushing some into forced sales.Some striking data on UK house prices this morning: British house prices jumped the highest in 11 years this month, according to Nationwide’s house price index.The end of lockdown appears to have unleashed some pent-up demand, and stamp duty cuts are expected to add further support in the coming months.The bounce back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions. The rebound in activity reflects a number of factors. Pent up demand is coming through, where decisions taken to move before lockdown are progressing. Behavioural shifts may be boosting activity, as people reassess their housing needs and preferences as a result of life in lockdown. Moreover, social distancing does not appear to be having as much of a chilling effect as we might have feared, at least at this stage. These trends look set to continue in the near term, further boosted by the recently announced stamp duty holiday, which will serve to bring some activity forward. But also a warning:However, there is a risk this proves to be something of a false dawn. Most forecasters expect labour market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead as a result of the aftereffects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down. If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead.The FTSE 100 is trundling along, as might be expected in late July (even if we do have a fair few dramatic company results to contend with).Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said:Tobacco, banks and media have been the worst performing FTSE 350 sectors in July.

Someone would post something speculative about when a certain aspect of life would return to normal, say, when the restrictions on the amount of daily outdoor exercise would be lifted. Then someone else would reply to, or share, their post with the caption: “Normal? Oh we ain’t never going back to normal.” I use the word “joke” generously, and when I say popular I mean “a lot of people did it”, rather than “a lot of people liked it”.This type of cocky, unevidenced prophesying has been one of the more annoying responses to coronavirus. None of us really knows what is going on, or how anything will turn out, but the person making this joke intends to present themselves as a kind of world-weary sage. Instead, they demonstrate a strangely naive misunderstanding of how invested in the old normal are the people currently in charge.The Conservatives are so keen to make sure that we definitely are going back to normal that in England, from this Saturday, companies can request that employees come back into the office even if they do not need to be there to work. This includes those deemed to be highly vulnerable to the virus, with the 2.2 million people who have been “shielding” also advised to return, and somehow institute strict social distancing measures for themselves within their workplaces.This initiative has been framed as a push to “get back to work” but, since the people it refers to have mostly been working from home throughout the virus, it would be more accurate to call it “get back to the office”. It is less about improving productivity and more about prodding workers into spending money in the chain restaurants, cafes and pubs that serve offices in city centres, because the furlough scheme will end soon.In this way, the government is trying to force us into a warped version of normal, in which there is no vaccine and workers are exposed to an undiminished coronavirus threat, but are encouraged to revert to buying the same Pret sandwich or meal deal lunch they used to have before any of this started.Many companies have decided they would rather not bring employees back, whatever the government says. This isn’t necessarily a charitable stance. It seems obvious that employers would rather not have lots of people taking time off sick if they can help it. Some firms have also probably started to rethink the value of expensive city centre office space and see this as an opportunity to continue an experiment into how necessary it is.Earlier this week, the Daily Mail ran a piece declaring that Downing Street was being “urged to beef up its ‘back to work’ message”, lamenting that the employees of several large companies will not be returning to offices. “Beef Up and Back to Work” sounds like a predictably coronavirus era version of the motivational second world war slogan “Keep Calm and Carry On” the piece went on to use buccaneering language like “toughen up”, as it condemned a list of “giants who have let fear keep UK plc locked down”. This included companies such as RBS, KPMG and Google, who have all decided not to follow the government’s plans, and keep the majority of employees at home for the meantime.This cheesy, patriotic sloganeering belies the seriousness of the situation we find ourselves in. With almost 50,000 people dead in the UK from Covid-19, and no clear sign of a vaccine, the incentive for people to return to a draining, and now dangerous, routine of commuting and open-plan offices for the sake of “UK plc” is minimal. Just yesterday, the health secretary Matt Hancock admitted he was worried about “a second wave starting to roll across Europe”.Asking workers to return to offices at the precipice of this seems ludicrous. Added to this, the high cost of rent in city centres has already hollowed them out and made them a hub for multiple versions of the same large chain cafes, shops and restaurants. It would not be the worst thing in the world if these spaces reverted to a less corporate version of themselves should working from home continue.There is a strange irony to the idea that the Tories are suggesting that companies should take steps they clearly consider adverse to their interests, since this is really in the name of helping out the state. Their hope may be that, by forcing workers back to city centres their spending will help make up the shortfall in revenue shops face as the government ends its furlough scheme – effectively plugging a gap left by government.This is very much antithetical to the free market ideology the Tories usually champion, where companies act in their self interest, with little regard for how their decisions affect the wider economy. The argument that businesses should be endangering their workforce for the sake of “UK plc” is unconvincing. To put it simply: why would they?• Rachel Connolly writes about technology, cultural trends and politics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc9d3ff06c68325bde5a2adecd44900a8b2a64cd/1302_616_4017_2410/master/4017.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=18eb4b545632023ed05dd5016dec678e","title":"animal stunning slowly being accepted by turkeys halal butchers say activists","story":"As Eid al-Adha begins, a campaign for painless killing is starting to win favour with slaughterhouses and religious leadersAs Turkey gears up for Eid al-Adha, or Qurban Bayram, the Muslim festival of sacrifice, animal rights campaigners are celebrating progress in their efforts to convince religious leaders, butchers and slaughterhouses of the merits of stunning animals before ritual slaughter.Livestock warehouses across the country were busy on Thursday before the festival began at sunset, with families inspecting sheep and cows to slaughter in honour of Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son Ismael.Qurban Bayram is the busiest time of year for Turkish farmers and butchers. While some families in rural areas will still raise livestock on their own land and ritually slaughter the animals themselves, hygiene rules mean that most of the slaughter is now carried out on specific sites by butchers trained by the local municipality.For Asalet Sancakdaroğlu, the Turkish representative of animal welfare organisation Eyes on Animals, the focus is on preventing animal suffering. To be certified as halal, an animal must be alive and healthy, its throat must be cut in one swipe by a Muslim using a sharp knife and blood must be drained from the carcass. Stunning the animal first does not contravene Islamic law – and Sancakdaroğlu is on a mission to educate slaughterhouses, religious leaders and consumers of that fact.“Most of my work is about spreading the word because there are so many misconceptions about halal slaughter. People are afraid that it is somehow not acceptable to God if the animal is unconscious, or that the blood won’t drain properly,” he said.Earlier this month, after Turkey’s coronavirus restrictions were lifted, Sancakdaroğlu visited a slaughterhouse in the north-east of the country, gifting the manager a captive bolt pistol to stun animals before slaughter. The slaughterhouse has agreed to now stun animals who arrive already injured at the plant before they are unloaded, and cattle will be stunned for customers who request it.Sancakdaroğlu has visited 300 of Turkey’s 900 slaughterhouses. So far only three have agreed to switch to stunning from the classical method, but he says this is largely due to poor availability of stunning equipment and the expense of importing it: industrial systems can cost upwards of €10,000 (£9,030). The gunpowder-triggered pistols also often get mired in customs paperwork because they are classified as weapons.“Some companies have told me off the record that they are already stunning animals, just not telling their customers,” Sancakdaroğlu said. “It’s quicker, safer, cleaner and therefore they make more money. It’s just that the public perception is still that it’s not halal.”There is also room for improvement when it comes to transfer and transport of live animals in Turkey, said Lesley Moffat, Eyes on Animals’ director.“Turkey has a long way to go but is not better or worse than other countries when it comes to inhumane treatment of livestock,” she said. “Our work there so far shows that more and more people are becoming interested in animal welfare, and that change is possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/644ab446335071ee9b0d670c76df5828a583c091/1248_1017_2004_1203/master/2004.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f34db966d005389a710c16d0837419d","title":"how to wear a glamisole","story":"A camisole can be a bra-strap minefield. This Michelle Obama-approved alternative has more substanceI don’t really approve of underwear as outerwear. I don’t mean this in a puritanical way. I’m certainly not slut-shaming anyone here. I just have a low opinion of it as a genre, in the same way that I have a low opinion of sleeveless knitwear (comfortable in absolutely no weather situation, so what’s the point?) and of contrast white collars on colourful clothes (unless they detach so that you can wash them separately, these look good for a maximum of three laundry cycles).Clothes should make your day easier and a spaghetti-strap camisole, or one of those flimsy cotton vests, is a bra-strap minefield. Even if by some miracle the front straps behave themselves and sit flush over your underwear, the back view is almost always a spaghetti-junction mess. Half-dressed just isn’t a vibe that works for me – nothing to do with the raunch factor, but because clean lines always look more chic.Enter the glamisole. A camisole, but with a little more substance to it, and enough extra detailing to be clothing rather than lingerie. It’s a very simple formula, really: what you are looking for is a top that is sleeveless, but not spindly-strapped. What Americans call a tank top, rather than a vest. This shape is surprisingly hard to find on the British high street, which has a tendency to favour a level of skimpiness in summer clothing out of all proportion to RealFeel temperatures. Again, not being priggish, I just don’t think goosebumps are chic.Your ideal glamisole goes like this. Straps that are at least an inch wide where they sit at the shoulders, maybe two inches. This width will cover bra straps comfortably and sit between your skin and the strap of your bag, so that you don’t wind up with a nasty welt where you carried the shopping home. Also – this is key – loose, rather than tight. Unless you enjoy feeling sticky, a little natural air conditioning is the way to go. A small amount of breezy volume makes it easier to tuck your top into the waistband of your trousers or skirt just tug it slightly loose, for a relaxed silhouette. The fabric can be silky and lace-edged, as here, or athletic and preppy.Michelle Obama – who always has an unerring eye for showing skin in a way that looks dynamic and healthy and vibrant, rather than naked – gives excellent sleeveless tank top. So if you don’t want to take my word for the glamisole, take Michelle’s instead. Either way, it gets my vote.

While it’s not as varied as red or white wines, however, there are still marked differences in styles, depending on the type of grapes used, the amount of skin contact and the level of sweetness.The most popular style is still the whisper-pink, ultra-dry Provence rosé, which often contains a small amount of white wine (usually vermentino, AKA rolle in Provence). Wines that contain a significant proportion of cinsault have a particularly appealing, crisp, citrussy bite. You generally find darker rosés in Spain and Latin America, and they’re generally riper and fruitier – the kind of rosé to drink with the big flavours of a barbecue, say.If you prefer a slightly sweeter rosé, look out for ones made from pinot noir, of which there are an increasing number, including from the UK. Countries that produce sparkling wine often have some excess pinot to turn into rosé (running off the first pressings, because rosé also helps to concentrate the reds).The other big variable, as you’ll no doubt have noticed, is price. Although there are cheap rosés (I wrote about eight of them a few weeks back), rosé, like champagne, seems significantly less price-sensitive than other categories, which, for a wine that is generally made without oak and doesn’t have to be aged, makes for a good return.• For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Spiegel’s source, Rui Pinto, who is charged with computer hacking in his native Portugal, which he denies, has denied that he obtained the emails by criminal means.City have vehemently denied that the Etihad sponsorship was subsidised by the club’s owner, Sheikh Mansour of the Abu Dhabi ruling family, or any other Abu Dhabi entity, since Spiegel first published the emails, and throughout the subsequent investigation and ultimate guilty finding by Uefa’s Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) adjudicatory chamber (AC). Pearce and senior Etihad executives gave evidence at the Cas hearing, categorically denying the finding, largely based on the published emails, that the airline did not pay the sponsorships in full.The emails considered by the CFCB and Cas included three from City’s then financial officers to Pearce, a City board member and senior adviser on the Executive Affairs Authority (EAA), a strategic Abu Dhabi government authority. The finance officers set out that in 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2015-16 Etihad paid only £8m of sponsorship deals City stated to be £35m, £65m and £67.5m respectively. The rest, they wrote, was being paid by Mansour’s company ownership vehicle, the Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG).City had refused requests from the CFCB for Pearce and other senior people to give evidence, and Cas severely criticised the club and imposed a €10m (£9m) fine for their failure to cooperate and obstruction of the investigation. Pearce did appear before Cas, as did James Hogan, the former Etihad chief executive, and other senior figures, and based largely on their evidence, the Cas panel overturned by a 2-1 majority the CFCB conclusion that Mansour “disguised” his own funding as Etihad sponsorship.Spiegel published the new emails two days after Cas released the full 93-page judgment that detailed its reasons.One of the new emails was sent by Pearce in December 2013, from his Executive Affairs Authority address to Peter Baumgartner, then Etihad’s chief commercial officer, with the subject “payments”. Pearce set out that under its sponsorship agreement Etihad had owed City £31.5m for the 2012-13 season, and £67.5m for the £2013-14 season, a total of £99m.“So we should be receiving a total of £99m – of which you will provide £8m,” he wrote to Baumgartner. ”I therefore should have forwarded £91m and instead have sent you only £88.5m. I effectively owe you £2.5m.”Pearce offered Baumgartner two options to reconcile the missing £2.5m. The first was for Etihad to pay only £65m of the £67.5m sponsorship for 2013-14 and pay the £2.5m the following year. The second option, Pearce wrote, was: “You pay the £65m now and I will forward the £2.5m in a couple of months – at which point you can forward it on.”Pearce apologised to Baumgartner for the missing £2.5m he had not sent, writing: “As I am sure you knew, embarrassingly it would seem that rather than overpaying you I have underpaid you!”The figure of £88.5m Pearce apparently sent to Etihad for forwarding to City tallies with the same figure, £88.5m, set out to Pearce in one of the previously published emails. That was sent five days earlier by Jorge Chumillas, City’s then chief financial officer, who said the breakdown of Etihad’s sponsorship of City was £88.5m from ADUG, while Etihad was paying £8m.Pearce’s evidence to Cas about the City’s finance officers writing in their emails that only £8m was coming from Etihad, was that the arrangements had caused “some confusion among iniduals at the club” and “a misunderstanding that ADUG was making funds available to Etihad”.City declined to provide a response to the contents of the new emails, as they did publicly in 2018, so they did not explain why or in what capacity Pearce was apparently sending £91m to the chief commercial officer of Etihad for its sponsorship of City.The club said in a statement: “The questions and matters raised by Der Spiegel appear to be a cynical attempt to publicly re-litigate and undermine a case that has been fully adjudicated, after detailed proceedings and due process, by the court of arbitration for sport.“Manchester City’s policy remains not to comment on out of context materials purported to have been criminally obtained from City Football Group and Manchester City personnel.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b230465560135235b7af182f7a00a525bd75a916/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=150e829355fb869e908e9bcfa3f4ea4b","title":"fix of the trade how google helped a handyman build his business online","story":"Wielding the right digital tools has enabled Will Lingard to thrive, even during lockdownAs with most self-employed tradespeople, word of mouth plays a significant role in Will Lingard’s job as a handyman in and around Wonersh, a pretty village of red-tile cottages and timber-beamed houses a few miles south of Guildford. Whatever your trade, glowing reviews are good for business.But since setting up Surrey Hills Handyman in 2016, Lingard has sought to gain further advantage, using Google My Business, a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google services. The tool helps him display his five-star ratings and the favourable reviews he has earned on his online profile, which – alongside the use of Google ads to reach new customers – have helped him grow his business exactly how he wants. Like word of mouth, in digital form.Four years on, Lingard can afford to be choosier. He specialises in “all the little jobs” that people often can’t find someone to do or don’t have time for themselves, focusing on quality, not quantity, “like bits of tiling or installing kitchen splashbacks, putting up picture hooks or fitting doorbells”.It’s here that promoting himself through Google tools has really paid off, taking on greater importance in recent months. Lingard had already taken to using Google ads, using keyword research to help find out what prospective clients were searching for online in and around Guildford – for instance, jet-washing a patio during the summer months – and then advertising those specific skills. This ability to be flexible and fleet of foot has had a significant impact on his business – “It’s quick, effective and direct,” he says – but really came into its own following the lockdown, when he was able to swiftly angle his remit as a “contactless service” in order to address customer fears around social distancing.Meanwhile, his Google My Business profile has helped him to keep existing customers updated with his working hours, while the review rating builds his reputation and earns trust with new ones. Lingard says Google also enables him to concentrate on the job at hand rather than tying himself up fielding calls asking what jobs he can do – the photos on Google My Business help showcase this to prospective customers. Even with the unpredictability of the future, given the pandemic, there is significant potential for tradespeople like Lingard to grow their businesses as households contend with the crisis. Homeowners have had more time to contemplate their surroundings, while a growing number of the UK workforce expect a permanent change to their company’s approach to flexible working post-lockdown. It means many homes and gardens will require improvements. Lingard’s Google profile, for example, flags up his skills at assembling flatpack office furniture.At a time when the wider job market looks uncertain, Lingard reveals that he is booked up six weeks in advance. “In a time of social upheaval and economic downturn such as this, demand for my services could have dwindled to nothing, but I’ve even been able to turn work away,” he says. “Google My Business has been central to me weathering the storm and future-proofing myself.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1de80d6c88b6832010edf537da5c49bf9a1ad0f/0_183_5433_3259/master/5433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=677e4bdfb22ec11f5cb79f5c4f0cc39a","title":"couples in england coronavirus are you planning on getting married at the start of august","story":"We would like to hear from those who have to change their plans due to coronavirus guidance from the governmentWith less than 24 hours notice, Boris Johnson has announced that the government is postponing the easing of lockdown measures which, from tomorrow, would have allowed couples getting married to have a reception with up to 30 people.  would like to hear from people getting married this weekend who were planning to have a reception but have now been told they are not allowed to.

At first I was concerned she might interfere with my alternate internet life (mostly MSN Messenger), at the time a precious space where I could practise being my independent self.“These friends you talk to,” Mum would say, “they might go to your school but I don’t know them. I don’t know their families. I don’t trust them and you shouldn’t either.”But it wasn’t long before my fear of Mum online became my fear for her. It began when she joined Facebook, and went on to post one too many earnest-mum comments (“My daughter is so beautiful!” she’d write under every picture). I showed her how to message me directly instead.At that moment I stepped into the role I remain in today: tech support. I am her Sherpa for the digital world. The best bit is showing her ways to make her life more convenient. The worst? Dodgy websites that look like real ones fake news sweetheart scammers targeting older women. That’s when I have to give her “the talk” about unscrupulous people and beg her to be more careful.This week, she reached out again. A stranger had called her on WhatsApp to say they’d found her missing phone. But when the stranger also said that the phone contained several nude photos and she should pay to get it back, Mum knew to hang up and block the number, before filing the details to the police.I cannot stop smiling about this. It’s not just a criminal deciding to choose my mum – who still uses the aubergine emoji to mean aubergine – as a target for sex-blackmail, but something more. Children eventually become the parents, and the only mystery is when. I’m smiling, too, because my mum sorted her own tech problem. She’s flown the nest, and I’m proud."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7e4d064b7007b5437d0a22aea04633125ef9f05/50_120_2558_1535/master/2558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f7d1a5421ad1cc64c957f4e92feaf2b","title":"free tv licences over 75s payment plans","story":"The lowdown on exemptions, payment plans and spotting text and email scamsAbout 5 million people in the UK over the age of 75 are losing their automatic right to a free TV licence and many will have to pay £157.50 a year. But there are some exemptions, a new payment plan for those who find the initial bill too much – and a promise from TV Licensing that you do not have to do anything until it contacts you.The BBC’s plan was for over-75s to pay from the start of June but this was delayed for two months by the coronavirus outbreak. The new payment regime begins on Saturday 1 August.The fee is £157.50 a year, payable as a lump sum annually or in weekly, fortnightly or monthly instalments.There is no extra cost to pay in instalments – you still only pay a total of £157.50 a year. If you choose to pay weekly, the cost is £3.06 for the first payment, then £2.97 a week after that. The fortnightly cost is £5.83 after a higher initial payment and monthly instalments are £13.12 each.TV Licensing says it will write to all over-75 licence holders starting in August. “This letter will let you know what action you’ll need to take for your next licence,” it says, adding: “We’ll give people plenty of time to set up a payment plan or to apply for a free licence if they are eligible.”Some people paying for the first time will be worried about popping into the Post Office to pay during the coronavirus pandemic. But you do not have to leave your home to pay the fee. You can make a payment online with your debit or credit card at tvlicensing or call the 247 payment line on 0300 555 0298 instead.Some over-75 households can still obtain a free TV licence. To qualify they need to be receiving pension credit. Pension credit is a benefit for people who are on a low income and have reached the state retirement age, and is paid on top of the state pension. The “guarantee” element of it can top up a single person’s income to £173.75 a week or a couple’s to £265.20. But lots of people fail to apply – it is estimated that of the 1.5 million over-75s eligible, about a third do not receive it.Pension credit not only entitles you to a free TV licence. Even if you are only receiving a small amount, it may qualify you for help with housing costs and council tax, automatically qualifies you for the cold weather payment and entitles you to claim funeral payments.AgeUK.org.uk has a useful online guide to pension credit, or call the pension credit claim line on 0800 99 1234.If you are 75 or over and live in a residential care home, you may be covered by an accommodation for residential care (ARC) licence. Under the scheme you will be eligible for a free licence without the need to be in receipt of pension credit. Ask the care home if it has a licence that covers the residents too.No. Although the first BBC licences, when they were introduced in 1923, were for radio, listeners have been exempt since 1971.You don’t need a TV licence if you only ever use on-demand services such as Netflix or Amazon Prime. But if you watch or record any programmes as they are being shown on TV – and that includes any channel, such as Sky, or downloading from BBC iPlayer – then you need to be covered by a TV licence.The TV Licensing website has a form you can fill in if you do not need to buy a licence.No. TV Licensing says it won’t ever text a customer to ask them to set up a payment plan or for their bank details, or to say that they are due a refund. These are all texts sent by scammers, so ignore them. If you have already set up a payment plan, it may text you to ask you to make a payment – log in through the website, rather than clicking on a link to be sure.Be careful of emails, too. The official messages will include your name and part of your postcode and come from donotreply@tvlicensing. As with texts, the safest way to respond is by going directly to the website, rather than clicking on any links you are sent.Beware of copycat websites. People have in the past been duped into paying extra for their TV licence from sites that purport to be official. Only go to tvlicensing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abbba2a8dfff35f8cb79568891a05b088e0fe702/0_39_4026_2417/master/4026.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36d8ab8873390df1a73ad692c50caf6e","title":"madonna takes on new role as covid 19 conspiracy theorist","story":"Singer’s claim vaccine is being concealed is latest example of stars spreading falsehoods during pandemicDancer, singer, songwriter, actor, director – Madonna has had quite the career.But the queen of pop’s latest reinvention came this week in the form of a video posted on Instagram that shared a coronavirus conspiracy theory with her 15 million followers.Madonna claimed a vaccine existed but was being concealed. “They would rather let fear control the people and let the rich get richer and the poor get poorer,” she said.Instagram blurred the video, captioned it “false information” and linked users to a page debunking the bogus claim. Later, it deleted the post.So ended another skirmish between celebrity, truth and the pandemic, an ongoing battle that pits fame against science and public health.Days earlier it was the turn of Lewis Hamilton to skid into trouble by sharing an anti-vaxxer post, which suggested Bill Gates was lying about coronavirus vaccine trials.The clip, which the Formula One driver shared with 18.3 million Instagram followers, shows Gates offering reassurance over potential vaccine side-effects and debunking false claims that any vaccine will be used to implant microchips in people. The clip is captioned: “I remember when I told my first lie.”After a backlash, Hamilton deleted the post and issued a statement praising Gates and backing a vaccine but expressing concern about “uncertainty” over side-effects from the potential coronavirus vaccine, which does not yet exist.Some celebrities such as John Cusack, Woody Harrelson and Wiz Khalifa have peddled the myth linking linking 5G technology to coronavirus. Others, such as the actor Evangeline Lilly, question the need for social physical distancing (she later apologised).There is even a conspiracy theory that celebrities are being paid to say they have coronavirus. “Such stupidness,” said Idris Elba, who contracted the disease earlier this year.Some of those challenged over spreading misinformation delete posts and plead misunderstanding. Others refuse to back down. Either way, say public health experts, messaging about Covid-19 becomes muddied.“Celebrities have a platform and when they abuse it it’s incredibly irresponsible,” said Paul Offit, co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “They influence people. Science doesn’t win out, the facts don’t win out. Emotion trumps scientific evidence every time.”Samuel McConkey, an infectious disease expert at RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences in Dublin, said many people turned to prominent names on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and other platforms for information about Covid-19.“Looking to our singers and actors as sources of information about this disease is daft. It’s like I was to do the singing and acting – it wouldn’t be entertaining. We have to work within our own domains and spheres of competence. Anyone who is turning to Madonna for scientific information has muddled thinking. Maybe we need primary school courses in epistemology.”Offit and McConkey credited some celebrities, such as actors Salma Hayek and Amanda Peet and boxer Katie Taylor, with using their platforms to echo established medical advice on vaccinations and other effective public health measures.A study by researchers at the Reuters Institute at Oxford University found most engagement with coronavirus falsehoods came via social media posts by politicians, celebrities and influencers.“Rather than being completely fabricated, much of the misinformation in our sample involves various forms of reconfiguration where existing and often true information is spun, twisted, recontextualised or reworked,” said the report.Baybars Örsek, director of the International Fact-Checking Network, a unit of the Poynter Institute, said celebrities should be mindful of their “amplification capacities” around falsehoods.“Covid-19 has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world and spreading misinformation on cures, vaccination and causes of the disease hurts the public’s trust,” she said.Orsek also urged internet companies to be vigilant. “Millions of users are being exposed to such falsehoods in any given day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b19d8e31d91efcaf484d023e31e8957d9b04947c/0_90_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ab36af472711eba69ff54732c1b498c","title":"how did britain get so overweight podcast","story":"As the government launches a newly interventionist strategy to tackle obesity, the ’s Felicity Lawrence looks at whether it goes far enough to take on the might of the food industryBoris Johnson once scoffed at what he saw as the “nanny state” instincts of politicians who sought to tackle the growing waistlines of the British public.

It has led to an unprecedented number of people relying on food banks and not being able to pay their rent.”The £20-a-week increase in the universal credit standard allowance introduced in April as a temporary boost to help claimants with extra pandemic costs should be made permanent, the report says, while work allowances should be increased to allow claimants to keep more of their award as they move into work.Forsyth is a Tory former government minister, while the committee’s Conservative members include the head of the NHS track-and-trace system, Baroness Harding, and the cross-bencher former Treasury permanent secretary Lord Burns.A decade of social security cuts meant benefits no longer reflected the cost of living, the peers say. The monthly standard allowance for a couple aged over 25 is currently £594.04, on top of which they may receive additional payments for housing and children. For a single person under 25 it is £342.72 a month.The committee is critical of the five-week wait for a first universal credit payment, which it says can push vulnerable claimants into debt, food bank use and rent arrears. Claimants should be given a non-repayable grant to help tide them over this critical waiting period, it recommends.Nearly £6bn of historic tax credit debts currently deducted from claimants’ monthly universal credit payments should be written off, it says. “The government should not jeopardise the financial security of claimants by seeking its recovery.”The wide-ranging report calls for the removal of the “unfair” two-child limit on benefits, and a review of the level of the benefit cap. It says “less emphasis” should be placed on benefit sanctions, saying they can push people into extreme poverty and there is little evidence that they incentivise people to move into work.The report, entitled Universal Credit Isn’t Working, sets out several principles that should guide the “substantial reform” needed to improve it, including dignity and respect for claimants, adequate income levels, security and stability, flexibility and fairness. The minister for welfare delivery, Will Quince, said the effectiveness of universal credit during Covid-19 proved that the case for it had never been stronger. “We welcome the acknowledgement by the committee that universal credit is here to stay and we will consider their recommendations in detail.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d4dec3a4c47efdb111c775ed1f865eaaeb15b31/0_5_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=806eb1a0c3fad9187cea744e5ef8bb13","title":"sports team owners black lives matter gestures","story":"Statements of support and solidarity were a good start, but it’s time for the billionaires in control of sports teams to wield their power to bring about tangible change in their communitiesMalcolm X warned us a long time ago to be leery of settling for symbolic victories rather than justice and actual progress.“The whole world can see it,” he said during a speech in 1963. “All this little tokenism that is dangled in front of the negro and then he’s told: ‘See what we’re doing for you.’”And so, like clockwork, as anti-racism protests swept the country over the last few months, the sports’ gesture machine cranked into gear. The Boston Red Sox unveiled a 250ft Black Lives Matter billboard next to Fenway Park gamers will be greeted with a Black Lives Matter message every time they load NHL 20 the NBA and WNBA unveiled a Black Lives Matter logos on their courts before their season restarts in Florida on MLB’s opening day, players and coaches knelt before the national anthem, and teams played a message of unity and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell admitted the league had been wrong on player protests and encouraged players to use their voices to speak out against racism and police brutality.At first I thought all these gestures were great. Teams, leagues and top-level officials across sports were condemning the killing of George Floyd, and declaring that Black Lives do in fact Matter. They weren’t generic, bland statements either: they went into detail you don’t normally see.For example, the Dallas Mavericks said: “We will NOT stand for injustice, inequity, and disparity. History goes through phases. Phases in Restoring (justice), Rebuilding (communities) and Rebounding (as people).”Meanwhile, the Miami Heat made sure to specifically name victims of police violence. “We deeply mourn the tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and too many others, whom we have lost to acts of extreme and excessive violence against African Americans,” the team said in a release.Every NBA team made a similar statement. And for this I have to give a lot of credit to the league’s commissioner, Adam Silver, for setting an example. Starting from when he took the reins and had to deal with the Donald Sterling situation, he has made it clear that he will speak out for justice and stand against racism.Was this a new beginning, I wondered? How beautiful that the entire sports world had finally reached a universal point of empathy. But then I noticed that police violence appears to have become worse after George Floyd’s murder, while hate crimes against people of color have actually risen during the pandemic.Now I wonder if these admittedly admirable statements are enough. Can these teams and their billionaire CEOs – I don’t use the term “owner” for obvious reasons – use their power and influence to bring about tangible change beyond statements of support and solidarity? Definitely.What if NBA CEOs took proactive roles in their respective cities and pressured police departments to move toward specific reforms and more accountability? It’s not as if men such as Mark Cuban in Dallas or Micky Arison in Miami are lacking in clout in the cities where their teams play. They are billionaires. Not millionaires like the players who have been doing an amazing job protesting, but billionaires (with a B) on whole other level of power and influence.What if they followed the recent example of FedEx, which showed the power of money when it comes to combatting racism.Dan Snyder, the majority owner of Washington’s NFL team, stubbornly refused to change his franchise’s racist nickname for years despite pleas from Native Americans that is was a slur. Then a couple weeks ago, he had a sudden change of heart. Why? Not because he had an Ebenezer Scrooge moment of clarity and wanted to right his wrongs. It was because FedEx, a sponsor who paid $205m for the naming rights to the team’s home stadium stadium, threatened to cut off their funding.Wu-Tang once told us that cash rules everything around me and they were absolutely right.What if the NBA and its teams’ CEOs used their influence to pressure cities to threaten to cut the funding of police departments if they didn’t adopt tangible reform and accountability measures? I bet you would see results as immediate as what you just saw in Washington.This could be done across the sports world, not just the NBA. Teams can take real action, with real results, instead of waiting for the players (who don’t have the same caliber of influence) to “speak” on these issues.Let me be clear: Nobody wants to completely abolish the police, but every organization needs checks and balances. Nobody in society should have carte blanche to do as they please, and unfortunately, that is the incredibly dysfunctional situation we have fallen into with our law enforcement departments.Declarations are great. Having Black Lives Matter painted on courts and fields are bold statements. And I guess playing the Black national anthem before NFL games is … something. But we need to go far beyond that in order to bring about real change.The situation reminds me of a conversation I had with Tiffany Crutcher, whose brother, Terence Crutcher, was killed by a police officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma.“We get moved by the moment … we’re angry, we’re outraged, and then we move on to the next thing,” she told me when I interviewed her for my book, We Matter: Athletes And Activism. “Let’s put some pressure, not just on the local government, but we need to put pressure on Jeff Sessions, on Donald Trump, and let them know that we’re not going to stand for this.”Who better to apply that pressure than billionaire CEOs of professional teams and the sports leagues themselves. They can use their influence beyond powerful proclamations and push for tangible results. Statements are great, but in this day and age, we need much more."},{"url":null,"title":"you cant just accept it the sporty 80 year old who wont take bladder weakness lying down","story":"As a busy magazine editor, remembering to do pelvic floor exercises wasn’t always the first thing on Wendy James’s mind. Now, aged 80, she explains why she’s making time for them, alongside regular tennis and core-strengthening pilatesThe card dropped through the letterbox just as I was leaving for my regular coaching session at the tennis club. “Welcome to your ninth decade,” it said. I’d just turned 80 and was planning to celebrate by doing a tandem skye for a local charity.I wasn’t shocked by the card’s message (no, really). I was prepared by the good-ageing philosophy of a thoughtful man called Cecil Kellehar who was fourscore years when he wrote for Choice, the lifestyle magazine for over-50s that I edited in the 1990s. Take it as it comes. Don’t rail against it. Have someone to love. Have something to do. Have something to look forward to. Keep fit.The last one’s easy: I’ve played tennis since I was 10 and do so three times a week if I can. I’d even been asked to join an over-75s group playing indoors every week. Covid-19 and the lockdown ended that, as well as something else I was really looking forward to: jumping out of a plane. Meanwhile, I’m in a weekly Zoom choir and we happily sing out to our heart’s content.I’ve got a husband and family (at a distance) to love and I’m always writing (journalists are like that), so that is certainly something to do. Emailing my MP about doing more to erase the inequalities revealed by the pandemic keeps me occupied.“Take it as it comes”, was my dad’s philosophy too. But sometimes you just can’t accept what life throws at you. Incontinence, for instance. Reading Miriam Margolyes’ frank account of hanging on to her pee, I related instinctively. We all know if you laugh for too long you can leak!But why on earth should it happen? Why is it so commonplace? At the end of the 1960s, after I’d had my two daughters, the health visitor encouraged me to do pelvic floor exercises daily. But I was a full-time working mother with a mortgage, and life went at such a speed that I never paid enough attention to my own body. When my son arrived in the mid 1970s, living pace was even faster – and tennis was put on hold.By the mid 1980s, I was back on the court, expending energy and eradicating angst built up from working long hours on women’s magazines. Fashion, beauty makeovers and diets, Princess Diana and Fergie, royal gardens and fabulous knitting patterns kept me occupied. It was a strange time. My periods were all over the place, as were my emotions – and I was putting on weight.It’s marvellous that we talk freely about women’s health today and it’s easier to find a sympathetic ear and a wealth of options to deal with oestrogen deficiency and menstrual problems. My heart went out to British tennis player Heather Watson whose performance in an important tournament was affected by the time of the month. Now you can avoid periods entirely if you want, with no ill effects – certainly no red or wet patches on tennis whites.My solution was twice-yearly HRT implants, which kept me stable until the 1990s, when I unexpectedly started leaking urine. My GP said my bladder had prolapsed, dropped down into my vagina, so I began doing pelvic floor exercises with a vengeance. I was inspired by Diana Moran, the Green Goddess, who created a range of keep-fit exercises for Choice. She made it all look so easy!At 60, I retired, just after the second of my older sisters died of ovarian cancer. Fearing this would be my fate, too, I used some pension money to go private to remove my womb and ovaries – and had a bladder “lift”. Fortunately, it didn’t involve the mesh, which has been devastating for many and is now banned. Mine was just a stitch, my surgeon said.For 10 years, every Saturday morning I attended a pilates class – our lovely instructor Lidia helped us focus on strengthening the core: making the abdomen and back muscles stronger helps your pelvic floor muscles to control the bladder. We lay on our backs, breathing deeply in and out as we lowered first one leg then the other to the side, eight to 10 times.I kick myself that I didn’t continue with pilates after we moved to the country. The wee problems recurred and I was back to wearing pads. Things improved a little when my GP suspected vaginal atrophy – caused by lack of oestrogen – and prescribed Vagifem, oestradiol tablets inserted like a pessary.Despite all this, I found I still often make an urgent dash for the loo. As a consumer journalist for more than 45 years, I’m always looking for ways to make things better. Panties with integral pads are useful, as accidents are contained. I bought a Kegel8 Ultra 20 electronic pelvic toner, a device with a spoon-like object that goes into the vagina. It was difficult to lie down for half an hour a day with this in place, and I discovered the prolapse was back. This doesn’t happen to everyone, I hasten to say.Then I read about Finnish Innovotherapy, a non-invasive training method using specially designed shorts and electrodes to generate contractions of the muscles. Five days a week, 30 minutes a day over 12 weeks certainly improved my awareness of my pelvic floor and the leaking lessened. It was a costly remedy: I bought it over six months, interest free. It may not be a realistic option for everyone – and you still have to do exercises.One thing I’ve learned about myself is that I need to be given instructions, and having downloaded MyPFF app onto my iPad I squeeze and breathe to order. And there’s new hope: I came across Alex Miller, a Canadian fitness trainer, who believes she has found why our pelvic floor muscles lose their ability to work properly. As we age, we slump! Do you notice yourself hunching over – when you’re using a laptop, driving, sitting at the table or in an armchair. Instead of being upright, our head and chin go forward, as does the abdomen. Raise your shoulders and chin, bring your head back and your body is properly aligned.Her combination of pilates and yoga exercises have shown me the error of my ways. I sit up straight, hold my tummy muscles in, breathing deeply in and out, and try to remember to use MyPFF app every day. When Covid-19 is gone, I’ll be ready to jump out of the plane – wearing a parachute, and hopefully no pad!As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

But Lisa McGee doesn’t believe in easy options. “My main thing right now is, don’t come expecting it to be funny,” she says with a laugh. “If anybody settles down to watch this expecting it to be like Derry Girls, then they’re going to be really disappointed.”The 39-year-old creator of the hit Channel 4 sitcom has a new series, The Deceived, airing on Channel 5 from Monday to Thursday next week – which McGee co-wrote with her husband, the actor and writer Tobias Beer. Gone are the belly laughs of Derry Girls: instead, this is an atmospheric thriller in the Daphne du Maurier mould. “Basically, me and my husband really like old movies like Dial M for Murder and Rebecca and wanted to create a show that paid homage to that genre and was also just a really good thriller where you can’t wait to find out what happened next.”At its heart is a love triangle between a charismatic university lecturer (Emmett J Scanlan), a student he teaches (Emily Reid) and his glamorous wife (Catherine Walker), who dies in mysterious circumstances while back in the family home in the isolated wilds of Donegal.Adding some extra spice to an already intriguing mix is the presence of the in-demand Paul Mescal (an Emmy nominee, as of this week) in his first post-Normal People role. “It’s hilarious how big he is now because he did this just after Normal People so obviously he didn’t know, and we didn’t know, that he was about to become one of the most famous men on the planet. We were very lucky and pretty thrilled to get him.”Did she feel tempted to give him some advice on what it feels like to become an overnight sensation? McGee laughs. “The last three years have been a bit of a rollercoaster,” she admits. “Up until now, I’ve been working so hard and it’s been so crazy. So I suppose one of the things that the last few months has given me is the chance to think: ‘Wow, did that all really happen?’”The biggest surprise was that this comedy about a gang of daft teenage girls in a small city in Northern Ireland in the mid-90s became a huge hit not only in the UK and Ireland, but around the globe. “We get letters from fans in Mexico and India saying how much they love the show. It’s quite crazy, but I think the thing that really connects is the Irish mum, that notion of matriarchs speaks to everyone, everywhere. It’s been lovely because this is the show that I will be proudest of when I’m really old. Because I wrote it the way I wanted to and I hope it does Derry proud.”The new series will tackle the notion that the fear McGee grew up with – not bombs or paramilitary shootings, but the prospect of peace. “I wasn’t really afraid until the peace process started, because that was when I realised that I had something good that could be taken away,” explains McGee. “It’s really scary, the possibility that this whole thing won’t work, that we’ll screw it up. You’re being given hope, but you’re also terrified that hope will be removed. I wanted to look at how vulnerable that can leave you.”If that sounds more serious than the standard joke-packed episode of Derry Girls, then it is in part because McGee has been worrying a lot of late about Brexit, and the febrile political situation in Northern Ireland, about protests in the streets and the murder in Derry of the young journalist Lyra McKee.“That was just so horrific. There was a lot of anger in Derry because there was this feeling of: ’We’re not in the 80s or early 90s any more,’” she says. “Also McKee had been welcomed into the city, her partner was a Derry woman, so, yes, there was a lot of anger that she’d come to this city to start a new life and then this happened. A lot of the reaction was driven by that notion of: ‘No, we’re not going to go back there, you’re not going to drag us back.’”She pauses. “So, yeah, that’s the politics side,” she says. “But, obviously, this is still Derry Girls, so the focus is still on what it’s like to be a teenager and that feeling that everything can change within 24 hours.” She laughs again. “Plus lots of jokes about nuns … because, let’s be honest, Catholicism is the gift that keeps on giving when you’re a writer and nuns are just pretty funny, full stop.”The Deceived is on Channel 5 at 9pm from 3 to 6 August"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55b3cccc2552044fdb2bbe6993bf4403b2185031/64_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc0d1b48f9099abce0c125bae223d715","title":"living off the land the new sisterhood of black female homesteaders","story":"From the South Side of Chicago to tiny Carolina farms, a growing number of Black women are reclaiming the land – and their wellbeingThe car made its way along a tree-lined gravel road. The sky was clear, and as the car drove by, the trees swayed from side to side, almost like a sign of welcome. The road opened up into a large pasture. In the middle of the pasture was a wooden pergola with grapes growing on it and a circular garden surrounding it. Tiny houses dotted the pasture, as brown children played merrily in the mud. In the center of all of this, planting in the circular garden like she was Mother Earth herself, was a Black woman.For Chantel Johnson, this scene was “heaven”. It was actually Bear Creek, North Carolina, in May 2016, but more importantly, it was Johnson’s first glimpse into homesteading, and she was hooked at first sight.Johnson, an African American woman in her late 20s at the time, made her way up the gravel road that day with her boyfriend, whom she’d met a few months prior on OkCupid. Johnson was attracted to his profile picture: a shot of him standing with goats. She recalls thinking to herself: “Are those goats? I want to meet those goats!”Johnson was grieving and depressed. It had been less than a year since her younger brother, who had been shot and paralyzed on the South Side of Chicago in 2014, succumbed to his injuries and passed away, in August 2015.She carried that grief with her up the gravel road that day to visit her boyfriend’s friends, an interracial couple – Black wife and white husband, with kids – who owned a 30-acre homestead in Bear Creek. When the friends offered Johnson and her beau the opportunity to live with them on the homestead and help out, Johnson jumped at the chance. If this was heaven, then perhaps she could find the antidote for her grief here.One of the first official uses of the term “homesteading” was in 1862, with the passing of the Homestead Act, signed by Abraham Lincoln to encourage western expansion and US agricultural development. But the act of homesteading – a focus on self-sufficiency dependent on the land, with an emphasis on subsistence agriculture – predates the Homestead Act, especially for Black Americans.Homesteading knowledge and skills allowed slaves to create a modicum of a life for themselves by growing their own supplemental food, raising small livestock and making needed tools and home goods. This same knowledge sustained Black families during the Reconstruction era and beyond. While there have been several resurgences of the self-sufficient homesteading mindset in the United States, the face of these movements has been overwhelmingly white.Meanwhile, Black people, and Black women in particular, have become the poster children for the antithesis of the values homesteading espouses. In contrast to self-sufficiency and hard work, Black women are stereotyped as dependent, disproportionately reliant on public assistance, and unwilling to work, perhaps most famously by Ronald Reagan’s racialized “welfare queen” remarks.Black women also bear the brunt of many of our nation’s worst health outcomes, including high rates of obesity, high mortality from heart disease and breast cancer, and some of the worst maternal health outcomes and infant mortality rates. Only recently has the medical field started to acknowledge the role of trauma in facilitating these disparities.Johnson recalls several layers of trauma from her childhood and young adult years. As a young girl growing up on the South-East Side of Chicago, she remembers moments of joy and abundance contrasting starkly with moments of anger and scarcity, which flowed lockstep with the dwindling of the family’s financial resources from the first to the end of the month.Then, as an undergraduate student at a predominantly white university in the midwest, she recalls being shunned by white and more affluent Black classmates alike, because she didn’t speak or behave the way they felt someone in that space should. She quickly learned to code-switch, alternating between ways of speaking and behaving based on her surroundings. It’s a practice that many Black people are all too familiar with, in their efforts to live, work and study in predominantly white environments.She also struggled initially with coursework, attempting to translate her Chicago secondary education, where she graduated as salutatorian, to the rigors of university work. Johnson has conflicting feelings about the costs and benefits of her undergraduate education: “I was so fortunate to be at that school, where an institution had time to nurture me, but at the same time I was being traumatized and I was being changed. And that was a very difficult thing.”Between 2012 and 2014, her middle brother and younger brother were each shot several times, but survived. The ultimate trauma was her younger brother’s untimely death, 15 months after he was shot in 2014.Johnson received her bachelor’s degree, graduating cum laude, later earned a master’s degree and obtained a research job in North Carolina. But the impact of the trauma remained. Taken together, these experiences created a rage against “the system” in Johnson. She was angry about systemic racism and poverty and the laws, policies and institutions that uphold it.“I’ve done everything right – star child, went to college, went to Africa for a few months, did AmeriCorps, I volunteered, I got this job, and I don’t understand why this isn’t enough and my brothers are being shot,” she says.This revelation, four months prior to discovering Bear Creek, marked the beginning of Johnson’s homesteading journey. In her mind, self-sufficiency was the only option, because the system wasn’t going to take care of her. It was rigged.Consequently, by the time she got her first glimpse of heaven, she was already intent on giving up her spacious two-bedroom townhouse in Durham, North Carolina – in exchange for less than 300 sq ft of shared living space, with no electricity or plumbing, and an outside toilet. She was ready to gradually transition from her research job, where she was miserable, in exchange for hard labor cultivating, raising animals and living off the land.The transition came with other challenges as well. Johnson recalls initially being scared of the chickens she was tasked with putting back into their coops every night, having to rely on the assistance of a five-year-old on the homestead for help. Also, after she moved to Bear Creek permanently, two of the first homesteading tasks Johnson learned were chopping wood and lighting the wood-burning stove for cooking and heat. Two months later, Johnson found herself in the dead of winter, cold in the tiny house. Everyone else was away she was alone and crying because she couldn’t light the wood-burning stove.“That’s when I started to regret my decision,” Johnson remembers. But thankfully her cellphone still worked, so she found a YouTube video that walked her through lighting such a stove. Figuring out how to do it convinced her that maybe she could make it in this way of life. That she could bet on herself to succeed in spite of the odds.While Johnson didn’t grow up with examples of homesteading around her as a child, for Aja Yasir growing your own food was always a normal way of life. Her parents were a part of the Second Great Migration: the period from 1940 to 1970 when Black people migrated from the south to northern states en masse. Both of her parents brought the practice of subsistence agriculture with them to Chicago, purchasing a vacant lot next to their home in Englewood, on the South Side, to establish a home garden. They weren’t alone other families in the neighborhood also had home gardens. For Yasir’s parents, the act of growing your own food was bolstered by 1960s and 1970s Black health messaging from the Chicago branches of the Black Panthers, the Nation of Islam, and Chicago-based Black public figures like Dr Alvenia Fulton.By the time Yasir was born, in the mid-1970s, growing food at home had become an established family tradition – a tradition that was almost broken when in her early adult years Yasir decided she wanted nothing to do with agriculture. Instead, she moved as far away from Chicago as she could, to pursue her bachelor’s degree in Atlanta. But a polarizing global figure would entice Yasir back to the land: the Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez.It was late 2005. Yasir had returned to the Chicago area, completed a master’s degree, and was working at a local radio station. A colleague at the station shared an article about Chávez ousting an American missionary group, New Tribes, from Venezuela, accusing them of being imperialists and exploiting indigenous people. Yasir’s interest was piqued. Then, in 2006, she heard Chávez’s United Nations speech, in which he referred to George W Bush as “the devil”, in protest against US global domination. Yasir wanted to investigate the conflicting media images of Chávez – hero of the poor versus villain of democracy. So she left Chicago for Venezuela, with no Spanish and a flimsy local job prospect. She stayed in a town in Barlovento, a region with a large population of Afro-Venezuelans, known for its cocoa production.Yasir still remembers how fresh everything tasted in Barlovento, and the prominence of locally grown and made food: “You cannot escape agriculture in that town because everybody is doing something involved with agriculture, whether it’s raising chickens in their yard, or growing bananas, or harvesting and making chocolate. Agriculture is just connected like that.” Barlovento made her appreciate her Englewood upbringing, rooted in urban agriculture.Her reunion with the land would come to serve her almost a decade later.Yasir considers herself to be someone with a lifetime of traumatic experiences, although she prefers not to retraumatize herself by going into detail about a lot of it. However, she did share about a recent anguish. In January 2016, her three-week-old daughter, Yaminah, unexpectedly died, falling victim to a rare genetic condition. The cumulative effects of years of unresolved trauma, combined with losing a child, resulted in a complex array of mental health challenges.A couple of months after the death of her youngest daughter, Yasir found herself driving around Gary, Indiana, with her husband, trying to decide if they could live there permanently. In 2015, the family had rented an apartment in Gary as a trial, prompted by the lower cost of living than in the Chicago suburb where they’d previously resided. Now they wanted something of their own. But Gary had its challenges – hit hard by deindustrialization, white flight, racism and poverty. The city was blighted and grocery stores were scarce.Yasir and her husband eventually found a house that had been abandoned for two decades in a less depressed part of Gary and decided to purchase it, under the expressed condition by Yasir that the only way she could live there was if she put a garden in. Shortly after purchasing the property, she mulched the entire front lawn with wood chips, a regenerative agricultural practice to enrich the soil, in preparation for her front-yard garden.To her surprise, her desire to do something as basic as grow food turned into a public battle with the city of Gary, which sent citations claiming that the wood chips in Yasir’s front yard were debris that was causing environmental problems in the neighborhood. “I didn’t realize that growing food was so abnormal until moving to Gary,” Yasir recalls. What the city of Gary didn’t know was that Yasir was prepared to fight back.She wasn’t just fighting for her garden she was fighting for her life.“You don’t understand the grief that a mother goes through when she loses a child … I would not be able to manage the grief without the garden, and so that was the fight. We don’t have a connection to Gary, we don’t have any family here, the only connection to Gary we have is this garden and the garden is how I process grief … I’m fighting for my medicine.”In 2019, Yasir sought the support of the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund, signing up with the organization as a homesteader. It sent an attorney from California to represent her case against the city. In October 2019, Yasir won. Also, unrelated to her case, in 2019 Yasir’s home became a certified wildlife habitat site with both the National Wildlife Federation and the Indiana Wildlife Federation. In order to be declared a certified wildlife habitat, a garden or outdoor space must be maintained in a way that provides a sustainable environment for native animals and insects.Typically, Yasir doesn’t get to spend as much time in her garden and homesteading as she would like, finding moments in between homeschooling her daughter and managing her real estate business. And the results of her labor don’t always materialize quickly, which can be challenging. Yasir explains: “The hardest thing about this lifestyle is patience. I’m a regenerative gardener, which means I put a lot of work into soil health and bioersity. Restoring balance to an ecosystem can be tough, especially when your family’s food is dependent on that ecosystem.”Johnson and Yasir’s stories illustrate homesteading lifestyles catalyzed by mental health needs, but for others the health of the physical body is what leads them to homesteading. This was the entry point for Jacqueline Smith (who goes by Jackie), although in a way she’s been preparing to homestead for most of her life.At the age of nine, Smith, also born and raised on the South Side of Chicago, was diagnosed with Type I diabetes. Her pancreas ceased to produce the vital hormone insulin, and Smith’s childhood was marked by strict dietary restrictions, daily insulin shots and frequent visits to the doctor. Having to deal with the illness as a child made Smith bookish, by her own description, and reserved.As a teenager, she attended Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences, not because she was interested in agriculture (in fact, the opposite was true at the time) but because her mother thought that the school would offer her a better education, due to its small student numbers and selective entry process. By the time she finished high school, Smith had developed a true interest in agriculture and was offered a full scholarship at a midwestern university where she pursued a bachelor of science in agricultural economics.While on campus, she was often assumed to be an African American studies major. Her interest in agriculture was frequently questioned by her largely white, male classmates, from America’s breadbasket states, who were perplexed as to why a Black woman wanted to learn about agriculture. She met their curiosity with her own questions: “Well, why not? Why can’t I learn this?” She never received a compelling response.The beginning of her undergraduate studies also marked Smith’s diagnosis with a second chronic illness, gastroparesis. After finishing her degree and while working at a corporate job back in Chicago in 2006, the stress of her illnesses sent her into a three-day coma. When she awoke from the coma in the hospital, she knew she had to make a change, but she wasn’t sure what or how, so she pursued a master’s degree in public service while she figured it out.After earning her master’s degree, she developed an itch to garden. She also started to have recurrent dreams of being pregnant, although she was not. The gardening itch, combined with the increased challenges of managing her health needs while working a structured and stressful 9-to-5, led her to quit her job and become a full-time homesteader. In 2018, she started an agricultural consulting business, GrowAsis, helping clients design, plan and maintain their own garden oases. When she “birthed” her business and new life, she ceased to have the pregnancy dreams.Smith lives in Roseland, on the far South Side of Chicago. A typical day involves waking up early in the morning, slipping on her denim overalls, grabbing the chicken feed from her garage, and heading to her backyard to tend to her chickens. She has a total of 11 hens that she keeps for egg production. She usually gives them a small snack of split peas or flaxseeds to eat while she cleans their coop. Their manure is collected and stored for later use in her garden beds. She then turns her compost bin before checking on the status of her vegetable and herb plants.Homesteading with two chronic illnesses is challenging for Smith. When her illnesses flare up, it can halt her productivity for days at a time. She’s had to learn to rely on fellow farming friends to step in during these times to help her keep her homestead afloat until she recovers. By doing this she’s built a community, a village, that supports her.Chantel Johnson has since moved on from Bear Creek, North Carolina, leaving behind that heaven, in search of one that is her own. The challenge is that Johnson is a landless homesteader, renting land to carry out her homesteading activities. She’s moved a total of four times since Bear Creek due to disadvantageous changes in the rental conditions or increasingly intractable rental relationships with the landowners – when you don’t own the land, you’re at the mercy of those who do. Her relationship with her boyfriend dissolved after move number two.Despite the challenges, with each move Johnson has been able to expand her operations. She and her boyfriend in Bear Creek started off with 25 hens for egg production, and then added a few pigs, chickens for meat and turkeys. When their relationship dissolved, Johnson kept the animals and continued to add to her livestock progressively. She eventually decided to abandon agriculture and focus exclusively on livestock, due to the frequent moves, as it’s hard to transport crops from one place to another.Today, Johnson is no longer fully off-grid, residing on a farm in Chatham county, North Carolina, with a little more living space and a few more creature comforts. She has come a long way from the newly minted homesteader of Bear Creek. She currently has 500 chickens she raises for meat, a significant increase over last year’s stock, due to the high demand for chicken during the coronavirus pandemic.

Johnson characterizes the first part of her homesteading journey as being about survival – proving that she could survive in this lifestyle. Now, she is determined to make the second half of her journey about thriving. It’s a sentiment shared by Yasir and Smith as well – the intention not just to survive, but thrive.Beyond this shared intention, these women’s stories are connected in their origins – experiences with trauma as Black women in the US and a decision to return to the land for healing: sisters of the soil, victors of their destiny.This story originally appeared on the digital storytelling platform Narratively.

There was also an increase in the number of patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19, and the figures for those requiring intensive care went up by one – the first time the figure has increased in 16 weeks.As France prepared for a heatwave, people were being urged to keep their face coverings on despite the soaring temperatures, expected to reach 41C (106F) in some areas.The number of new cases in the previous 24 hours was 1,377, only slightly fewer than the previous day, which was a record since May, and the number of clusters under investigation rose by 10 to 151. There were 16 deaths in hospital in the previous 24 hours, taking the total number of deaths in France attributed to coronavirus to 30,254.“In week 30 the increase in new positive cases is much higher than the increase in the number of tests carried out,” it declared.The R-number – the number of people one person with the virus will infect on average – rose from 1.35 to 1.42.The increase in number of clusters was said to be a result of large family gatherings as well as public and private events.Santé Publique France said the rise was also due to the “drop in the systematic adoption of prevention measures (keeping a minimum 1-metre distance, not shaking hands and stopping embraces)”.Meanwhile, thousands of demonstrators were expected to gather in Berlin at the weekend to protest against restrictions introduced to dampen the spread of coronavirus.Under the umbrella title “End of the pandemic – the Day of Freedom”, erse groups from the extreme left and right, including anti-vaxxers, Holocaust deniers, and conspiracy theorists who believe the virus has been imposed by an elite in order to gain power, are due to hold dozens of inidual protests across the German capital.Police and lawmakers have urged participants to observe physical distancing rules and to wear face coverings, amid evidence that the frequency of the virus is increasing once again.One group of demonstrators has suggested “storming the Reichstag”, the German parliament building. Others have rejected the idea, arguing it could bring the protest into disrepute. More than 1,500 police are expected to be on duty, with about 22,000 protesters due to take part from across Germany, according to Berlin’s interior ministry.The main gathering is expected to take place at the Brandenburg Gate in the centre of Berlin, before participants march down the wide 17. Juni boulevard to the Victory column. Other protests are planned for elsewhere in the city.The anti-coronavirus restriction demonstrators had been thought to be in decline since Germany began to gradually relaxed its lockdown rules after reducing the number of active infections.The demonstrators draw from a range of interest groups, including followers of the US group QAnon – an online conspiracy theory cult focused on the idea of a “deep state” dominance, one of whose heroes is the US president, Donald Trump, and the Querdenken (“lateral thinking”) alliance, whose followers wear tin-foil pendants and are against a coronavirus vaccine, and have gained more traction the longer the pandemic has continued.Its sympathisers have used social media to gain support. This weekend’s events are supposed to mark the first time the various groups will actively, rather than accidentally, come together.One of its figureheads, a celebrity vegan cook called Attila Hildmann, has been banned from speaking at the rally due to the defamatory, far-right rhetoric he has used at previous protests.Nikolai Nerling, a prominent Holocaust denier who broadcasts his views on YouTube, is expected to be present. The far-right NPD has also announced it will participate.One of the protesters’ broad demands is for the German parliament to call fresh elections in September, a year ahead of schedule, so that voters have the opportunity to bring down what is referred to as the “corona emergency government” of the chancellor, Angela Merkel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c61538eaf345c2efcaad60fc686a2dd5ce31c6fb/149_0_2512_1508/master/2512.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e5b7343a10e09effc1854c10ca6c0eb4","title":"fewer people or less consumption the population debate","story":"As a mission sets off to hunt for life on Mars, the Upside considers what to do about the teeming abundance of life on EarthIt’s one of the great ironies of 2020 that in a year spent trying to save so many people, we’ve come to the conclusion we have too many on the planet.That was the gist of a large number of emails (our inbox was certainly overpopulated) that Upside readers sent in on the subject of global population. It’s a controversial subject but that didn’t stop scores of you weighing in, suggesting everything from fiscal tweaks and the repudiation of growth to an outright no-child policy.A random selection appears below, but before we get to them, a quick roundup of the week in Upside news.• The return of the great European sleeper train. Three-minute journey• The angel of Togo. Two-minute read• Fusion – the big energy breakthrough? 90-second reaction• Summer in the city: more trees, less asphalt. One-minute read• The startling collapse of plastic bag usage. One-minute read writers have latched on to the population issue (Sian Cain on the child-free debate is particularly good). But Upside readers have been more prolific still. Here’s a flavour of what you said when asked about the impact of a levelling off of global population.Sju Thorup in Gentofte, Denmark, wants to be far from the madding crowdNobody benefits from a world of 8 billion or 11 billion people, except for large capital interests that need cheap labour and mindless consumers. Children in smaller families receive more of their parents’ time, efforts, money, living space. Parents in smaller families enjoy more time to themselves and better opportunities for each child.No inidual person enjoys being surrounded by other people at all times, competing for space and resources. Personally, I think that ideally the Earth could carry about 1 billion people who could all enjoy sufficient space, sufficient contact with nature, sufficient work and sufficient leisure, sufficient food and clean water. Such number of humans would enable us to leave enough room for ecosystems to recover and to remain fertile and robust, and to provide “ecosystem services” for a content humanity. But I know I am dreaming, for now. Such a scenario would require our decision-makers to think long-term and holistically, to decide restrictions on our activities, and enforce those restrictions all around. Too few people in power feel this need yet.Stella Dixon in Chester, England, says the debate should be about consumption, not absolute numbers of peopleI don’t understand what is so terrifying about the population reaching 11 billion people. There is nothing inherently threatening about more people existing, it is the conditions of their existence that count. I think it is more useful to focus on preventing the terror of human suffering, not caused by population but other factors. The world’s population is immense and almost impossible to change, while these other factors are much more actionable without signalling to eugenics.If the concern is overconsumption causing climate change, then people with the means to do so can make a difference by reducing the impact of their consumption – buying less, buying locally, and buying items sustainable both in environmental and human rights terms.Duncan Orr in Edinburgh worries about what population decline would mean for 200 years of steadily growing prosperityThe problems of a decreasing population are much more extreme than most people realise. While everyone talks about the cost of caring for an ageing population, the economic effects go far beyond that… growth becomes not simply more difficult but impossible at the global level. For years the environmental movement has talked about the need for a zero-growth world and logically they are right: infinite growth is not possible on a finite planet. But all of the economics and ideologies of the last two centuries… have been built on the idea that economic growth is what leads to the prosperity and wellbeing of a country.Policymakers around the globe are going to have to come to terms with the fact that a zero-growth world is being thrust upon them, and a whole new way of operating is going to have to be devised if we are to maintain living standards into the next century.Clint Koble in the US said fiscal policy should encourage people to have fewer childrenFewer people on the planet would put less stress on wildlife and the environment. It would stop the growth of large urban areas and hopefully, stop the burning of the Amazon forest. Fewer people would ensure that in the future, people would have a job. We wouldn’t have to fear automization, robotics etc.Instead of offering tax deductions for additional family members, we should penalize additional family members above 2 children as a possible way to control the population. The biggest step would be to make birth control available to every woman in the world.Robert Negut in Bucharest advocates even more drastic measuresA drastic population reduction is the main necessary condition to even have a chance to solve the world’s major environmental and social problems. So it’d be great if it would fall, but what this estimate presents would be far too little, far too late. The only way to offer everyone a decent standard of living and a large amount of freedom in all other aspects of life, … and also, eventually, have a healthy ecosystem, is to not only fully embrace and encourage far fewer births but, considering how bad things are, even find ways to completely stop births for a time.Nils Wetterlind sent a postcard from the future – a rapidly depopulating province in JapanThe sober view of all this is of course that Japan’s population more than doubled in the last 100 years, so it shouldn’t be a disaster if it shrank back to 50-60 million living souls. That is still a huge amount of people compared to my own homeland, Sweden, which is more or less exactly the same size as Japan, and of a very similar shape, but only has 10 million inhabitants.And of course it would have a gigantic positive impact on the planet if these islands had half, or a quarter, of the people they have today.There are only benefits to having a smaller, more technologically reliant society. Apart from the fact that it is soul-crushing to live in a dying nation.Andrew Somogyi says we need a change in human natureIF people continue to be SO self-absorbed as to CONSUME as currently, no matter if there’s a population reduction, the perceived needs still rise per capitaSo, we gonna need artificial reduction in human DESIRE ...

Infamously, this includes Gucci’s blackface jumper, Prada’s golliwog trinket and Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana’s pizza advert. And yet there is a reluctance to discuss the underlying issues openly.Speaking to the  in June, Buchanan said there was “extreme fatigue” around the admission of racism in the country. “But that doesn’t justify the constant denial,” he said.The incidents continue to occur. Earlier this week, label Marni was criticised online for the demeaning and colonialistic imagery used for their springsummer 2020 collection. Diet Prada, an Instagram account that acts as a self-appointed industry watchdog, reported that the images featured a black model with chains lying suggestively close to his feet, and another which featured the phrase “jungle mood” juxtaposed next to a black model. The visual allusions had some commenting: “This is the worst example presenting black bodies through the white gaze.” Marni later deleted the images and apologised saying: “As we endeavor to create a more equitable world … we sincerely regret that our efforts cause further pain.”The letter from Jean and Buchanan suggests there would be less moments of gross cultural insensitivity if there were black people in senior decision-making roles. “Many of the mishaps and racially insensitive conversations that have happened in Italy are clearly due to companies not including black people internally from entry-level to executive positions,” it says. “The oversights are clear every time a major gaffe is made.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ca103020a78c37c820605197a364e576648c631/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=70c3120a18fdd7e960f4ff6c2ada2138","title":"what new lockdown rules northern england coronavirus measures","story":"All you need to know about the updated coronavirus measures affecting more than 4m people More than 4 million people across swathes of northern England were given less than three hours’ notice on Thursday night that they must endure tighter lockdown restrictions to stem a resurgence of Covid-19 cases.But what what exactly do the new measures mean for those living in affected areas in the north and elsewhere in England?Greater Manchester, including the City of Manchester, Trafford, Stockport, Oldham, Bury, Wigan, Bolton, Tameside, Rochdale and Salford. In Lancashire, affected areas include Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle and Rossendale. Bradford, Calderdale and Kirkless, in West Yorkshire, are also included.The government says people living in the highlighted areas are not allowed to meet other people they do not live with inside a private home or garden. Exemptions apply where people have formed support bubbles or for “other limited exemptions to be specified by law”. Published guidance also states that if people live in the affected places they should not visit other people’s properties or gardens outside the areas with additional lockdown restrictions.Pubs, restaurants, cafes and gyms remain open in the affected areas but people are being told not to socialise with other households in these settings. New laws passed by the government will enforce the restrictions on people meeting in private homes and gardens, meaning to do so will be illegal unless an exemption applies. The police will be able to issue fixed-penalty notices of up to £100 to those who breach the rules.The guidance on meeting people in public outdoor spaces in the affected areas remains the same, in line with the rest of England. People can meet outside in groups of no more than six people, unless the group includes only people from two households. Social distancing must be maintained with those who do not live together in households, unless they are in the same support bubble.Yes, people living inside and outside the affected areas can continue to travel to and from work.From 1 August, clinically extremely vulnerable people do not have to follow shielding guidance “unless they live in Blackburn with Darwen in the north-west and other local affected areas across England where shielding continues”. But people are being told not to visit family or friends in care homes, unless in exceptional circumstances.Weddings, civil partnership ceremonies and funerals in affected areas are allowed but must be limited to no more than 30 people. People are also allowed to travel to the affected areas for these ceremonies. Places of worship are open to visitors but people must socially distance from other households, as well as take extra care, such as by wearing face coverings, and the government recommends religious services take place outdoors, if possible.People in the affected areas should not visit or host friends or family in private homes or gardens, the government says, nor should they meet and mix in restaurants or cafes. Two households, or up to six people from different households, may meet outdoors in public spaces but social distancing must be maintained for those who do not live together.People may attend mosques but social distancing must be maintained between households. “This means maintaining a distance of 2 metres, or 1 metre with mitigations (such as wearing face coverings). We recommend at this time that, if possible, prayerreligious services take place outdoors,” government guidance states.In Blackburn with Darwen, where lockdown easing was paused this month, indoor facilities including gyms, fitness and dance studios, sports courts, swimming pools and water parks remain closed by law. The same measures apply to Bradford. Leicester city, which was already facing tighter lockdown restrictions, is also included in the measures restricting household visits, although pubs and restaurants there are still due to reopen from Monday as planned. In Luton, temporary restrictions will be lifted from Saturday to bring it in line with the rest of England after the government said “significant progress has been made in controlling the virus”. Outside of the affected areas, the  lockdown guidance remains the same for the rest of England. People are allowed to meet in groups of two households in any location, including inside private homes, but social distancing must be maintained between those who do not live together unless they are in the same support bubble. So-called support bubbles, which allow single adult households to mix without social distancing with one other household they do not live with, are counted as a single household. Outdoors, up to six people from different households can meet. Households are also allowed to stay away from their homes with one other household, but social distancing must be observed.

Photograph Nick BradshawThe manicured lawns at the front entrance at Trinity College Dublin have been removed and are about to be transformed into a wildflower meadow in response to Ireland’s “bioersity crisis”.First announced in February, the move which make islands of the famous twin statues of Edmund Burke and Oliver Goldsmith, brings to an end to 150 years of grass cutting, which made the lawns at the front of the college as smooth as a cricket pitch.The conversion into a bee-friendly, wild-flower meadow began in recent days after the public overwhelmingly backed the move in an online poll in April.Of almost 14,000 votes, 12,500 were in favour of replanting the front of the university which faces onto College Green.Prof John Parnell, chair of Trinity’s grounds and gardens committee, said the results sent a message that “people want to see more bioersity and in particular want institutions to set an example”.Though the area may end up looking less tidy, supporters of the idea say it will be an important reminder of what wild nature looks like.Research shows lawn-mowing, ground preparation and pesticide control can disturb important insects that feed and nest in the soil.Planting wild flowers and minimising interference supports bioersity, and provide a habitat for native insects and food for pollinators in the city centre.The plants will a mix of annuals and perennials, with as many of them being of known Irish origin as possible. The aim was to extend flowering over as long a period as possible.The area will flower in spring and summer, and be left untouched over the winter months when pollinator insects – such as butterflies, hoverflies and bees – hibernate.The re-wilding move represents a pioneering attempt in Ireland to place wild-flower spaces in the heart of the city. The area – one of the most prominent areas in the capital – sees thousands people pass by on a daily basis.Plants and grasses at other parts of campus are already in the form of mini meadows and cut only a few times a year to encourage wild species and to assist students and academics studying ecology."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4318097.1596136727!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"12 ways of avoiding dementia identified in major new study","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe authors call for nine ambitious actions to be undertaken by policymakers and iniduals. Photograph:iStockModifying 12 risk factors over the course of one’s life could delay or prevent 40 per cent of dementia cases, according to the latest verdict of The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention and care.The commission has added three new “key modifiable risks factors” that make people more vulnerable to dementia excessive alcohol consumption in mid-life, suffering head injuries in mid-life and exposure to air pollution in later life. Led by 28 world-leading dementia experts, the report builds on the nine risk factors from childhood to later life identified in 2017, and provides an up-to-date analysis of the best evidence on the prevention of dementia. “The potential to prevent cases of dementia is high,” it adds.Its latest report presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference on Thursday calls of states and iniduals to be ambitious about preventing dementia and lays out a set of policies and lifestyle changes to help prevent dementia. Worldwide around 50 million people live with dementia, a figure projected to increase to 152 million by 2050, rising particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) where around two-thirds of people with dementia live. Dementia affects iniduals, their families, and the economy - with global costs estimated at about €1 trillion annually.Combined, the three new risk factors are associated with 6 per cent of all dementia cases – with an estimated 3 per cent of cases attributable to head injuries in mid-life 1 per cent of cases to excessive alcohol consumption (more than 21 units per week) in mid-life, and 2 per cent to exposure to air pollution in later life. The remaining risk factors are associated with 34 per cent of all dementia cases. The factors associated with the greatest proportion of dementia cases in the population are less education in early life hearing loss in mid-life, and smoking in later life (7 per cent, 8 per cent, and 5 per cent, respectively).In certain countries, however, the proportion of older people with dementia has fallen, probably due to improvements in education, nutrition, healthcare, and lifestyle changes – demonstrating the possibility of reducing dementia through preventative measures, it concludes.“Our report shows it is within the power of policy-makers and iniduals to prevent and delay a significant proportion of dementia, with opportunities to make an impact at each stage of a person’s life,” says lead author Prof Gill Livingston of University College London, UK. “Interventions are likely to have the biggest impact on those who are disproportionately affected by dementia risk factors, like those in low- and middle-income countries and vulnerable populations, including Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities,” he added. Prof Livingston added: “As societies, we need to think beyond promoting good health to prevent dementia, and begin tackling inequalities to improve the circumstances in which people live their lives.” Risks could be reduced by creating active and healthy environments for communities, “where physical activity is the norm, better diet is accessible for all, and exposure to excessive alcohol is minimised”. The authors call for nine ambitious actions to be undertaken by policymakers and iniduals: – Aim to maintain systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury) or less in midlife from around age 40 years– Encourage use of hearing aids for hearing loss reduce hearing loss by protecting ears from high noise levels– Reduce exposure to air pollution and second-hand tobacco smoke– Prevent head injury (particularly by targeting high-risk occupations and transport)– Prevent alcohol misuse and limit drinking to less than 21 units per week– Stop smoking uptake and support iniduals to stop smoking (which the authors stress is beneficial at any age)– Provide all children with primary and secondary education– Lead an active life into mid, and possibly later life – Reduce obesity and diabetes. These actions, they say, are especially important in LMICs such as China, India and Latin America, where dementia rates are rising more rapidly than in high-income countries. This is due to increasing life expectancy, and a higher frequency of dementia risk factors such as lower rates of education high rates of hypertension, obesity, hearing loss and rapidly growing rates of diabetes. The authors note they were careful to only include risk factors with strong evidence for a causal link. Their report calls for holistic and inidualised evidence-based care that addresses physical and mental health, social care, and support that can accommodate complex needs of those with dementia. “Keeping people with dementia physically healthy is important for their cognition but they often have other illnesses which they may struggle to manage on their own, resulting in potentially harmful preventable hospitalisations,” it notes.

Photograph Nick BradshawThe Nineteenth century documentation proves conclusively that the statues taken down by the Shelbourne Hotel do not depict slave girls, an art historian has said.Kyle Leyden, who is a lecturer in the history of art and architecture at the University of London, says the original catalogue from which the four statues were ordered clearly label them not as slaves, but Egyptian and African women.Hotel management said on Tuesday they took the decision to remove the pieces, which have been in place for 153 years, in light of world events and the Black Lives Matter movement calling attention to the legacy of slavery around the world.In a statement on Wednesday Dublin City Council said it was “not aware of permission being granted to remove the statues concerned. “The matter is under investigation by the planning enforcement section and therefore no further comment can be made on the matter at this time.”The catalogue of the Val d’Orsne foundary in Paris, where the statues were cast, has been digitised and is available online.The statues were originally designed and sculpted by Mathirin Moreau (1822-1912) son of another famous French sculptor, Jean-Baptiste-Louis-Joseph Moreau.In 1849 he entered into an association with the Val d’Orsne foundry and became one of its directors.Under the arrangement, he supplied models to be cast and mass produced by the foundry which could thus sell them on to architects under his name (as appears in the catalogue) on the basis of his fame as a sculptor. They were sold to those who could not afford an original work.Mr Leyden said the architect of the Shelbourne Hotel who designed the current facade, John McCurdy, would have ordered the four statues from the catalogue which was published in the late 1850s.It was clear the from the catalogue that McCurdy ordered two “Égyptienne” female statues to stand astride the front doors of the hotels with the other two statues entitled “Négresse” at either end of the front facade.The word “Négresse”, as used by the French in the mid-19th century, meant the female figure was of African origin, but not from North Africa.Mr Leyden explained that, if the statues were intended to depict Nubian slaves, they would have been classified as such because they were in vogue in the mid-1860s when the four statues were commissioned for the Shelbourne Hotel.However, Nubian slave statues were usually male nudes and were depicted in poses of servitude. The Shelbourne Hotel statues are of well-dressed females in an enlightened pose, he stressed.“’Nubian slave’ was a well-known and much fetishised nineteenth-century visual trope and to some buyers of statues would no doubt have been an attractive and very fashionable visual reference which was distinctly au courrant,” he said.“Verdi was writing Aida about a Nubian slave at precisely the time the Shelbourne was being built. If Moreau, the Val d’Orsne company or McCurdy had wanted a statue of a Nubbin slave, they would have had no qualms about calling it precisely that.”Mr Leyden said the blame for categorising the statues as slave girls may lie with the novelist Elizabeth Bowen who described them as “Nubian in aspect holding a torch-shaped lamp. Two of the four are princesses two are slave-girls. I like to image that Mr McCurdy and Mrs Jury (wife of one of the co-owners) chose the statues together”. That description was published in her 1951 book on the Shelbourne Hotel.“As anyone who has read it can attest, it was never intended to be an academic history of the hotel but rather a novelesque evocation of the place and its people,” Mr Leyden explained.“ It is not based on what we would today deem to be sound academic research. Her reference to the statues is as baseless and romanticised as her imagined scene of Mrs Jury personally choosing the statues because of their clothed respectability.“Yet this reference has been repeated ad nauseam ever since. There is no source for the slave assertion save Bowen’s own romantic imagination coloured by her knowledge of nineteenth-century Orientalist literary tropes.“Indeed, several other statues in the catalogue (mainly male) are specifically labelled as Nubian, but not the two chosen at the Shelbourne. They are not slaves. They are not shackled. All four wear golden anklets as symbols of their aristocratic rank. They are all aristocratic women of Egypt and Africa.“Thus it seems likely McCurdy chose these statues firstly because their proportion suited his building. Secondly, their symbolic message was one of luxury, hinting at the deliciously licentious opulence of the new hotel. Choosing statues from the best art foundry in the world would also have had much currency in promoting the opulence of the hotel.” Mr Leyden said the Shelbourne Hotel had made a wrong decision in getting rid of the statues from their plinths and had clearly misrepresented the statues as the depiction of slaves.He suggested the issue could have been easily resolved by placing leaflets at the front door describing the provenance of the statues.“ In this the statues could become commercial incentives to visits rather than an embarrassment and, should any problems arise, the leaflet will easily explain why they are there,” he added.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 cases in several green list states rise at higher rate than in ireland","story":"Some countries on the Government’s travel green list have seen significant increases in Covid-19 cases since the list was announced last week.The latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) confirm the extent of sharp rises in infection rates in Gibraltar, Monaco and Malta since July 21st, based on the number of new cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the previous 14 days.As of Wednesday, cases in Malta have increased to 6.9 new cases per 100,000 people, compared with the State, which is currently at 5.3.Monaco has seen an 800 per cent increase to 27 such cases per 100,000 people, while Gibraltar’s figure has increased from 2.9 to 17.8.Other countries on the green list, announced late on July 21st, which have seen an increase include Cyprus from 3.9 to 5.1, Italy from 4.6 to 5.2, Lithuania from 3.8 to 5.4 and Slovakia from 3.9 to 5.4.People arriving into the State from countries on the green list do not need to spend 14 days in self-isolation or to restrict their movements.Countries on the list which have seen an increase in cases but whose new cases per 100,000 people are still less than three include\u0026nbspFinland, Greenland, Hungary and Norway.Estonia, Greece, Latvia and San Marino, which are also on the green list, have seen new cases per 100,000 people decrease since July 21st.It was confirmed on Wednesday that the Government is unlikely to undertake an immediate review of the countries on its green list despite some states experiencing big increases in cases.The Government is to stick to a fortnightly review of countries considered safe to travel to.Health adviceThe list was drawn up at a Cabinet meeting on July 21st based on advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and it will be August 4th at the earliest before the list will be re-examined.A Government spokesperson said the locations on the green list have a “similar or lower incidence of the virus to Ireland”.“A number of factors are taken into account – such as the number of new cases over the past 14 days per 100,000 of inhabitants, overall response to Covid-19 etc.“Data from the European centre of disease control which benchmarks countries based on the number of positive tests per 100,000 in the last 14 days is being used,” the spokesperson said.Meanwhile, the latest data shows that the number of new cases in Spain stands at 51.1 per 100,000 people, while Portugal is at 32.7, France is at 17.1, and the UK is at 14.

Image: Oireachtas TVThe final hours of the Dáil sitting before the summer recess ended in vitriolic exchanges with the House being suspended twice in a tumultuous row over speaking slots for Dáil debates.Small political parties and Independent groups expressed fury at a deal they claimed would allow the Government to remove them from the early stages of debates and effectively “muzzle” them.The Government sought the changes to give their backbench TDs better speaking slots.In chaotic scenes, Government and Opposition TDs roared at each other across the Dáil auditorium in the Dublin Convention Centre.Leas Cheann Comhairle Catherine Connolly struggled to maintain order and was forced to suspend proceedings for 10 minutes when TDs refused to take their seats.And Tánaiste Leo Varadkar hit out at the “arrogance, nastiness and abusiveness of the smaller parties and far left parties” who tried to dominate the chamber.In a major broadside he said he was “embarrassed to be a member of this chamber tonight frankly because of the behaviour of some of the parties”.He said the new procedures would still give Opposition parties 74 per cent of the speaking time, “even though they’ve less than half the seats”.Mr Varadkar claimed that any time a Government Minister or backbencher tries to make a point “you shout us down in the same way you bully people online”.He said they repeatedly tried to “bully people in here because they are from a larger party”.The row erupted when People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett and Rise TD Paul Murphy refused to resume their seats.Mr Murphy claimed the Government was attempting to marginalise left-wing parties and groups.Ms Connolly described TDs’ behaviour as “disgraceful” before suspending the House.Ceann Comhairle Sean Ó Fearghaíl later was forced to suspend the House a second time and accused Mr Boyd Barrett of “histrionics” when he again refused to sit down.Earlier, Social Democrats TD Catherine Murphy said the Dáil would restart in September with “an outrageous proposal to change the rota of speakers in a way that had not been changed since the 1920s”.Fine Gael TD Brendan Griffin told Opposition deputies they were a “national disgrace and we’re entitled to our speaking time and we won’t be denied our right to speak”.People Before Profit TD Bríd Smith said it was like a “dictatorship” of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.Sinn Féin TD Pádraig Mac Lochlainn said what had happened was deeply regrettable and his party had put forward a compromise proposal to strike a balance for all but the proposal was rejected.When a vote was taken in the Dáil the Government proposal was accepted by 86 to 63 votes.The uproar followed a row earlier in the day on the issue when it was first raised.Under the new proposal, the Government parties, Sinn Féin and Labour will speak in the first slots.Then Government and Sinn Féin will speak again followed by the next largest party (Social Democrats) and so on.It means the Coalition and main Opposition parties will get to speak before each smaller party or grouping gets a chance to be heard.While the amount of speaking time does not change, speakers from the smaller parties will not be heard until much later in the proceedings, when usually there is less interest in the debate.Mr Varadkar said it “wasn’t fair” that in the previous Dáil “Independent TDs and people from micro parties got more speaking time than Government backbenchers”.Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore said “it beggars belief” that the Government and Sinn Féin have come together “to exclude voices of the Social Democrats, Solidarity-People Before Profit and Independent groupings from the speaking times”.But Mr Varadkar insisted “we are going to re-establish democracy in this House” and the Opposition “can try to shout us down as much as they like”.The row in the chamber on Thursday followed a stormy meeting on Wednesday of the Dáil Reform Committee where the Government parties and Sinn Féin agreed to change the current arrangement where a representative from each party and grouping gets to speak in rotation at the start of debates.Ms Whitmore said “it is undemocratic and unfair. It is very disappointing that Sinn Féin has joined the Government on this front.”Rise TD Paul Murphy claimed “the Government is trying to muzzle the Opposition” and it was not about the amount of speaking time.But Mr Varadkar said every TD’s mandate “is equal” and “we had a situation in the previous Dáil where Government backbenchers could not get speaking time”.He said “Independent deputies and people from micro parties got more speaking time than Government backbenchers did and that wasn’t fair.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4316073.1595964623!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"post brexit checks may deter firms like tesco from trading in northern ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGettyConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords.Lord Kerr, the architect of article 50 which enabled the UK to exit the EU, has warned that the special arrangements put in place to avoid a border on the island of Ireland may be a fatal trade barrier for some companies.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, all businesses sending goods to the region from Great Britain will have to make formal declarations for the first time, with food sellers such as supermarkets subject to separate checks on chilled and fresh food from January.“How confident are you that GB businesses are just not going to write off the Northern Ireland market?” he asked the Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker who was appearing before the Lords EU committee.Just three weeks ago the first details of the new trading conditions across the Irish Sea emerged, with businesses obliged to complete three rounds of customs, security and transit forms on all goods being transported to Northern Ireland.Mr Walker said the government intended the new system to be “light touch” and streamlined.However, he faced further questions about the government’s preparedness with Lord Teverson questioning whether the new IT system, the Goods Vehicle Movement System, would be tested in time.And the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lamont challenged Boris Johnson’s repeated assertion that Northern Ireland businesses would continue to enjoy “unfettered access” to Great British markets.Lord Lamont argued there was a clear conflict in the Brexit protocol between article 5, which demands Northern Ireland businesses complete exit summary declarations for all goods being transported to the rest of the UK, and article 6, which promises “unfettered access”.“That is a rather awkward thing,” he told Mr Walker as he defended the government position, saying it was within the UK’s gift to ensure unfettered access.Mr Walker conceded that some of the detail of the protocol had yet to be agreed by the joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and the vice-president of the European Commission, Maroš Šefcovic.He also said details on the Northern Ireland border operating model, expected yesterday, would be published in the “coming weeks”. - "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4317119.1596058117!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"second shock of brexit may be too much for ireland to cope with coveney told","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney  has been warned that Ireland is ‘facing into Brexit from a fundamentally different economic starting point than for a no-deal Brexit in 2019’. Photograph:  Niall CarsonPA Households and businesses may not have the capacity to withstand a second economic shock as a result of a hard Brexit at the end of the year, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has been warned, as the Government intensifies its planning for the UK’s departure from the EU.Given the economic damage already wrought by Covid-19, Mr Coveney has been warned that Ireland is “facing into Brexit from a fundamentally different economic starting point than for a no-deal Brexit in 2019”. In official briefing documents given to the Minister as he resumed office following the formation of Government, officials also told him that protecting the €85 billion trade link with Britain will be “vital to our overall economic recovery” and that Ireland needs to build a new relationship with the UK and with British cabinet ministers. Officials warned that “the capacity of households and businesses to manage a second economic shock will be more limited” in light of the pandemic. The Government is also hoping that a “landing zone” for major outstanding issues in Brexit talks can be found in September or October but, at present, the gap between the UK and the European Union remains “wide”. Contingency plansAll Government departments are intensifying Brexit contingency plans and a new Brexit Omnibus Bill will be brought to the Oireachtas after the summer recess. “The gap between the EU and UK positions remains wide, including on key issues such as the level playing field, fisheries, police and judicial co-operation and governance. “For progress to be achieved, it will be necessary for the UK position to move considerably in the direction of what they had agreed to under the political declaration. “The political declaration sets out the parameters for ‘an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership’. However, in negotiations, the UK has adopted a significantly less ambitious approach,” the briefing says. The October European Council and discussions held in advance will be “crucial in identifying the landing zone for a possible agreement and on implementation of the protocol”. Officials have said that despite the continuing uncertainty on the future relationship between the UK and EU, the Irish Government should now work to develop a new relationship with the UK. “Driving a renewal of the relationship is a priority task, given its importance in terms of our joint stewardship of the Good Friday Agreement, our people-to-people relations, and the Ireland-Great Britain economic and trading relationship worth €85 billion per annum, the protection of which will be vital to our overall economic recovery.” It says, as part of that, “identifying how best to build relationships across the new British cabinet and wider political system will be important”. “In terms of immediate contacts, there has been good East-West communication on Covid responses, which could usefully continue. “Engagement to protect Irish interests will also continue to be necessary, as the final picture of the UK’s future relationship with the EU emerges.” Officials have recommended the establishment of a new consulate in the north of England.In terms of Ireland’s relationship with the US, officials said that “developing our bilateral relationship with the US will take place against the backdrop of difficult policy issues relating to immigration, trade and transatlantic relations”. It said EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan was “committed to progressing an EU-US trade deal and Ireland is well placed to play a role in this”. The Minister was also asked to focus on “close engagement with the Trump and Biden election campaigns in the lead-up to the November US presidential election”. On the relationship between Ireland and Canada, Mr Coveney was told that “ramping up the relationship with Canada will be a key component of our economic response to the disruption caused by the pandemic”.

File photograph: GettyYemen’s separatists have abandoned self-rule, agreed to implement a stalled peace deal with the Saudi-sponsored government, and acceded to joining forces with its military in the conflict with Houthi rebels.Yemen’s government spokesman has expressed hope that this would be a “serious and true start” to the implementation of the deal.UN envoy Martin Griffiths has welcomed the development an “important step” in the effort to resolve the Yemen conflict. Saudi foreign minister prince Faisal bin Farhan also called it a “positive step” and said it will enable the government to restore services to the city of Aden, where control has been disputed by the separatists, and revive the southern economy. Under the Riyadh agreement, drafted by the Saudis last November, the Southern Transitional Council has been compelled to renounce its cherished goal of securing autonomy and secession for the south, which united with the north in 1990. The council has also pledged to honour a ceasefire with government forces, withdraw to positions held before clashes erupted, and merge its fighters with government units. The deal provides for the appointment within 30 days of a new technocratic government of 24 ministers, half from the south, half exiles from the Houthi-controlled north. Council spokesman Nizar Haitham acknowledged on Twitter that the decision to abide by the Riyadh agreement had been taken under pressure not only from Saudi Arabia but also the separatists’ ally, the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This development could heal a rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which has used the separatists to achieve its objective of securing control of Yemen’s strategic Gulf of Aden ports. The Saudis seek to defeat the Houthis and reunite Yemen under the government of Riyadh-based president Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who was expelled from Yemen’s capital Sanaa in 2014 by the Houthis. The separatists’ capitulation coincides with Houthi offensives against government forces in a stalemated conflict which has killed more than 100,000 Yemenis and devastated the poorest country in the region. Death tollBefore the advent of Covid-19 more than 130,000 Yemenis had died from disease and malnutrition while millions had been displaced. Since April 10th, when the first coronavirus infection was identified, there have been more than 1,700 confirmed cases and 490 deaths. Half of Yemen’s poorly equipped and ill-maintained hospitals have been destroyed or damaged during the war while medical staff have not been paid for months. Tests, medicine, protective gear, and oxygen needed by those with breathing problems are in short supply. Médicines San Frontières’s head of emergency programmes in Yemen, Roger Gutierres, told The  on the phone from Sanaa that hospitals receive “very few” mildly infected patients.

We must be willing to react to the first signs of trouble.”Face coverings are to be mandatory in indoor settings where people are likely to come into contact with people they do not know, such as museums and places of worship, from August 8th, Mr Johnson said. “With those numbers creeping up, our assessment is that we should squeeze that brake pedal . . . in order to keep the virus under control.“On Saturday August 1st, you’ll remember we had hoped to reopen a number of the higher-risk settings that had remained closed and today I’m saying we’re postponing those changes for at least a fortnight.“That means until August 15th at the earliest casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and the remaining close-contact services must remain closed.“Indoor performances will not resume, pilots of larger gatherings in sports venues and conference centres will not take place, and wedding receptions of up to 30 people will not be permitted.”Mr Johnson added: “I know that the steps we are taking will be a real blow to many people, to everyone whose wedding plans have been disrupted or who cannot now celebrate Eid in the way that they would wish.“And I’m really, really sorry about that but we cannot simply take the risk.” – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4318175.1596146576!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"restrictions tighten in northwest england due to covid 19 rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople sit outside a pub in Rochdale, greater Manchester.

In Rochdale, the one borough where cases have fallen, they are still too high.“We have always said that we will remain vigilant and be ready to respond quickly should the need arise.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer US president Barack Obama speaking during the funeral of late civil rights leader John Lewis in Atlanta on Thursday. Photograph:  Alyssa PointerPoolAFP via Getty ImagesBarack Obama called for sweeping reform to US voting laws during his eulogy at the funeral of civil rights activist and veteran congressman John Lewis, in one of his biggest political interventions since leaving the White House.“I know this is a celebration of John’s life. There are some who might say we shouldn’t dwell on such things. But that is why I’m talking about them,” Mr Obama, the former Democratic president, said at Lewis’s funeral service in Atlanta on Thursday.He demanded national laws to expand early voting, automatic voter register for all Americans, and making election day a national holiday.Mr Obama’s comments came just hours after President Donald Trump suggested November’s US presidential election should be delayed, repeating unsubstantiated claims that the vote would be marred by fraud due to more mail-in ballots. Republican lawmakers have swiftly rejected the idea.Mr Trump did not attend Lewis’s funeral. Mr Obama was joined at the event by former presidents George W Bush, a Republican, and Democrat Bill Clinton. The only other living former US president, Democrat Jimmy Carter, who is 95, sent a letter that was read at the service.Lewis first rose to national prominence more than half a century ago, in August 1963 during the March on Washington to advocate for the civil and economic rights of African Americans. He died earlier this month at the age of 80.Lewis was arrested some 40 times while protesting against segregation, and subjected to several life-threatening beatings, including notably on “Bloody Sunday” in March 1965 in Selma, Alabama. He later served as a Democrat in the US House of Representatives for more than 30 years, until his death.His body lay in state at the US Capitol in Washington earlier this week before Thursday’s funeral at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where Martin Luther King Jr was a pastor in the 1960s.On Thursday morning, The New York Times published an essay written by Lewis shortly before his death. The civil rights activist said he was “inspired” by protests following the killing of George Floyd, writing: “You filled me with hope about the next chapter of the great American story when you used your power to make a difference in our society.”Mr Obama was the final speaker at a lengthy service that included eulogies from Lewis’s family, friends and colleagues, including Mr Bush and Mr Clinton, as well as Nancy Pelosi, Democratic speaker of the House.The former president has largely shied away from political statements since leaving office, though he has returned to the public eye in recent months in support of Joe Biden, his former vice-president, who will be Mr Trump’s Democratic opponent at the ballot box.Pointed criticismsMr Obama offered some of his most pointed criticisms of the incumbent to date on Thursday, lashing out at the Trump administration even if he did not directly name the president.“Bull Connor may be gone, but today we witness with our own eyes police officers kneeling on the necks of black Americans. George Wallace may be gone, but we can witness our federal government sending agents to use tear gas and batons against peaceful demonstrators,” Mr Obama said, referencing both staunch segregationists of the past and recent government actions following Floyd’s killing.The former president added: “We may no longer have to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar in order to cast a ballot, but even as we sit here, there are those in power who are darnedest to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations, and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws, and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the postal service in the run-up to an election that is going to be dependent on mail-in ballots so people don’t get sick.”Mr Obama called for a new “John Lewis Voting Rights Act” that he said should include a provision “making sure every American is automatically registered to vote, including former inmates, who have earned their second chance”.Voting access for former felons has proved highly contentious. Earlier this month, the US supreme court declined to restore voting rights for ex-convicts in Florida, a key battleground state that is often decisive in presidential elections.National holidayMr Obama also called for more polling places and early voting, as well as a law making election day a national holiday “so if you are somebody who is working in a factory, or you are a single mom who has got to go to her job, and doesn’t get time off, you can still cast your ballot”.The former president endorsed statehood for Washington DC and Puerto Rico, called for an end to partisan gerrymandering – the drawing of congressional districts to favour specific political parties – and endorsed scrapping the filibuster, an arcane Senate rule that can delay or block laws from being passed.“If all of this takes eliminating the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic, in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that is what we should do,” Mr Obama said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"uk facing second coronavirus wave no sign one yet scientists","story":"Put simply, if you test more people, you\u0027ll see more cases.Professor Karol Sikora, the dean of medicine at the University of Buckingham, said: We\u0027re processing 10 times as many tests a day now. The average ticked up today, and cases certainly aren\u0027t falling, but we do need some context.An increase in localised outbreaks is also entirely expected at the end of a pandemic, and experts say cases are now so low that, if these levels were happening without knowledge of coronavirus, nobody would have spotted the new disease.Professor Carl Henegehan, director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University, said: Across the board, normal life is not resuming because we\u0027re still instilling a sense of fear in the community when cases are very low.If we didn\u0027t have testing now we wouldn\u0027t even be considering it a problem, because it\u0027s so low.

Both those countries saw rules relaxed at a different pace.Only 14 per cent of participants in England claim to understand the rules completely now lockdown has eased (see video below), compared to 18 per cent in Wales and 27 per cent in Scotland, according to the study.Dr Daisy Fancourt, one of the study\u0027s lead authors, said: This could possibly reflect difficulties in applying the rules to more complex life scenarios amongst younger adults, or may be reflective of the different amounts of time spent following the news on Covid-19 amongst different age groups.The general drop-off in understanding could be due to unclear messaging from the Government, or a reduction in interest and engagement from people, especially with the cessation of the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing in late June.The research, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, is the UK\u0027s largest study into how adults are dealing with the pandemic.It also found that access to healthcare has fallen, with one in 10 people across the UK reporting being unable to see or speak with a GP about their physical health.Around one in 20 were unable to speak to a professional about their mental health, while one in five reported not telling a GP about symptoms of an illness when they usually would have, even when an appointment was available.Meanwhile, researchers said depression and anxiety levels, life satisfaction and happiness have all shown improvements across every socio-demographic group. Loneliness levels have also decreased further, but there is little change in people reporting major or minor stress due to Covid-19, unemployment, finance or getting food, according to the study.Cheryl Lloyd, the education programme head at the Nuffield Foundation, said: With concerns growing over a second wave of Covid-19, it is concerning that many people in England report not understanding the current Government guidance.As another Nuffield-funded study by the Reuters Institute has shown, people are less likely to access news about Covid-19 on a daily basis now that lockdown has eased.With the rules changing regularly, this may be a factor in the public not understanding the Government guidance.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prince andrew lobbied us government favourable epstein plea","story":"Prince Andrew allegedly lobbied the US government on Jeffrey Epstein’s behalf for a favourable plea deal in a underage prostitution case in Florida in 2008, it has been claimed in newly unsealed court documents.The trove of documents, published for the first time after an appeal to keep them secret by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell’s lawyers was rejected this week, highlights the relationship between the Duke and the disgraced late financier.They are part of a 2015 civil lawsuit brought against Epstein and Ms Maxwell, 58, by Viriginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims she was forced by the millionaire to sleep with Prince Andrew and others when she was 17.Two unnamed victims of the financier, identified only as Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2, allege that he relied on help from Prince Andrew and other high-profile friends to secure a reduced sentence from the US Attorney for South Florida.Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution in 2008 as part of a controversial sweetheart deal with federal authorities in Florida.He served 18 months in prison, though he was allowed out on work release for 12 hours a day, six days a week.The Does were appealing for the release of documents in the case which they said would prove the royal\u0027s involvement.(They are) seeking documents regarding Epstein’s lobbying efforts to persuade the government to give him a favorable plea arrangement, including efforts on his behalf by Prince Andrew and former Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, they claim.They have alleged these materials are needed to prove their allegations that, after Epstein signed the non-prosecution agreement his performance was delayed while he used his significant social and political connections to lobby the justice department to obtain a more favorable plea deal.The Duke has claimed he moved to distance himself from his former friend after the conviction, meeting with him on only one occasion in New York in 2010 to formally cut ties.In another part of her deposition, Ms Giuffre is asked by her lawyers in 2016 if Prince Andrew would have relevant information that could help investigators.Yes, he would know a lot of the truth, she said of the Duke. I don’t know how much he’d be able to help you with, but seeing as he’s in a lot of trouble himself these days I think he might, so I think he might be valuable.Ms Giuffre, now 36, claims that she was forced to have sex with Epstein, who in turn forced her to have sex with a number of his associates. Epstein instructed Jane Doe to give Prince Andrew whatever he demanded and required her to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse, the lawyers said. Maxwell faciliatated Epstein’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a madam.Ms Giuffre in other parts of the testimony says the now famous photo of Prince Andrew with his arm around her waist in a London mansion was taken by Epstein on her Kodak camera. She says she gave the picture to the FBI during their investigations in 2011.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel updates portugal reopens nightclubs yet country remains","story":"Tui will not be flying any customers to Mallorca until at least August 10The face mask rules in your favourite European holiday destinations Holiday quarantine: Which country will be next?

The homes will be completed in two months.Read the full story.A report in the  this morning stating that Portugal has lower Covid-19 rates per capita than several other countries in Europe – namely, Belgium, Monaco and Andorra, which remain on the UK’s green list – surprised few of those in the travel industry in the Algarve. All are indignant, and feel that Portugal has been treated unfairly.“It is sad,” said British citizen Chitra, “not to have many British the Algarve welcomes more than two million of them each summer. But of the few that are here, many are extending their stays. Embraced by a national park on all sides and the Atlantic in front, the feeling of space here is strong, and with our accommodation mainly in villas that suits the social distancing requirements.”She added: “I think we are seeing the beginning of a new travel tribe from Britain, digital nomads who have gone one step further than the WFH brigade.”The first British tourists to visit Antigua since the pandemic began will arrive on the island on Saturday – and could be on the beach within 70 minutes of landing, the head of the its tourist board has said.Colin James, CEO of the Antigua and Barbuda Tourism Authority, said the island has had since the beginning of June to finely tune its arrival screening process – it was one of the first countries in the region to reopen its borders – and that the “long waiting times” warned by the UK Foreign Office should not materialise. Antigua welcomes around 90,000 Britons in a normal yearAll visitors are required to present evidence of a negative coronavirus test taken no more than seven days before departure, but some arrivals may require additional testing. On Saturday, the first flight from the UK to the Caribbean island will arrive from London Gatwick. Operated by British Airways, it is fully booked. Tourism accounts for nearly 60 per cent of the island’s GDP, but Antigua has not rushed its return to the holiday market. Hugh Morris has the full story.The Government is using British holidaymakers as \u0027bargaining chips\u0027 in Brexit negotiations following the decision to reimpose travel restrictions on Spain, argues Amancay Tapia....the British government is well aware that the millions of euros which British visitors usually contribute to the Spanish economy every year would be welcomed by any other nation in the world in a heartbeat.Right now, more “sentidiño” from our leaders is required.

Without a sufficient incubation period, this testing just does not work and on most occasions, will be too soon to show anything providing unreliable results.“A blanket fortnight quarantine isn’t the solution, though there is a balance to be had. Instead of testing those who have travelled immediately, quarantine should still be imposed, but to a far lesser extent. This quarantine would only need to be between four and eight days, at which point those travelled – and those who they live with, if they haven’t travelled – should be tested for the virus. This allows for the incubation period to be met and will mean that infection will be shown. It will also mean that, after this shortened period, those who have travelled can make informed decisions.“We look at other European countries such as Austria and Iceland who have ditched the blanket quarantine strategies for similar testing instead and can see positive trends from doing so. Whilst such tests aren’t free at present, this safe route should be encouraged.”Ski holidays will resemble an “old school experience” next winter, according to resort bosses in America.As skiers and snowboarders look eagerly towards the end of 2020 and subsequently the beginning of a new season there are many questions around how resorts will operate and what life in the mountains will be like.“No doubt, next ski season will be more of an old school experience, but that could also translate to less noise, fewer distractions and, hopefully, more meaning,” said Mike Kaplan, president and CEO of Aspen Skiing Company, in an open letter to its customers this week.Skiing in Aspen is making a U-turn“Like everything in our lives pre-Covid skiing and snowboarding had become somewhat frantic. Many of us were caught up in the conquests – tracking our bowl laps and vertical – rather than fully appreciating the moments,” he said.“I’m looking forward to refocusing on the core of what this sport is all about, what this place enables: a chance to connect deeply – with nature, with our physical selves and movements, and even with our sense of purpose and our roles in society.”“Understandably, many people want a return to ‘normal’ – but perhaps we can do better than that,” said Kaplan.Lucy Aspden has the full story.Asked in a press conference today whether English holidaymakers should be worried about staycations this summer with rising R rates in some parts of the country, Boris Johnson completely refuted the matter.I would encourage people to still think of wonderful staycations here in the UK.

All my happiest holiday memories are of holiday vacations here in the UK - bucket and spade jobs or whatever. And I thoroughly, thoroughly recommend it, and I am sure that people will have a great time over the summer.Johnson added that though he will be working flat out, he hopes to take his own staycation this summer. But where might he be headed? The Cotswolds? Norfolk? Chris Leadbeater examines the options here.In a press conference today Boris Johnson has announced that face coverings will become mandatory in a number of additional settings, including galleries, museums, and places of worship.Authorities will have powers, including a greater police presence to ensure face masks are being worn.A report by the BBC has revealed that Jet2 is contacting some customers on Spain\u0027s Balearic and Canary Islands to ask them to end their package holidays early. Customers have been contacted by email and text message.This follows the decision that was made to suspend all holidays and flights to Spanish Islands up to and including August 9, as well as all holidays and flights in mainland Spain up to and including August 16.The airline has said the reason behind asking customers to end holidays their holidays early even though this has not been requested by the Government, is because Jet2 cannot keep sending empty planes to pick up passengers on many different dates.Anyone that returns from Spain to the UK currently must self-isolate for 14 days.Check the map below to see the status of each country in Europe.Following the UK’s Foreign \u0026amp Commonwealth Office advice against all but essential travel to Spain, Javier Piñanes, director of the Spanish Tourist Office in the UK has issued a statement in response to the decision.In it, he said: In the last seven days, ten people have sadly died across the whole of Spain due to Coronavirus however most holiday destinations have not reported any recent deaths and have low incident rates.  Likewise, the increase in cases in Spain is not resulting in a significant rise in hospitalisations. In the last week, there have been 25 ICU admissions across the whole country.Looking specifically at the infection rate over the last seven days (data recorded 30 July 2020), many of Spain’s regions report figures well below accumulated rates in other European countries where travel bans have not been imposed.  For example, the rate of accumulated cases in the Canary Islands is just 2.4 per 100,000 people and in the Balearic Islands it is 11.3. Work is being carried out between the Spanish and British authorities so that decisions are made or adjusted based exclusively on epidemiological criteria. There are many popular destinations in Spain visited by British tourists, (such as Andalucía, which includes Costa del Sol, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, the region of Valencia and many of Spain’s northern regions such as Asturias, Galicia and Cantabria) which have infection rates similar or below those reported in the United Kingdom.The UK might be basking in a heatwave but skiers and snowboarders are looking ahead to colder climes, as dates have been released for a number of Europe’s winter festivals, reports Lucy Aspden.Rise Festival, which was one of the few festivals to actually take place last winter, is hoping to return to the French resort of Les Deux Alpes from December 12 to 19 as planned and tickets are on sale.Meanwhile Snowboxx, which takes place towards the end of the season in Avoriaz, has also taken the plunge and confirmed dates for 2021: March 20-27. Earlybird tickets went on sale yesterday – to reassure ticket holders their money is safe a statement read: “In the event of a full cancellation or rescheduled date, ticket-holders will be entitled to transfer their ticket to a rescheduled show, or a full face value refund on their package.”Snowbombing, the longest-running festival of its kind, has announced it will return to the Austrian resort of Mayrhofen on April 5 to 10 2021 after it was forced to cancel its week of headline acts such as Liam Gallagher, The Streets and Foals last season. Tickets are not yet on sale but keen fans can pre-register their interest.With over five months until the ski season kicks off it remains to be seen how festivals in the mountains will need to adapt to social distancing measures, capacity restrictions and other Covid safety measures, especially as there are concerns around how traditional apres ski venues will adapt to the new normal – but for the time being those who missed out on their chance to party in the mountains are glad of the prospect of being able to dance in their ski boots once more.The cathedral city of Salisbury was still recovering from the Novichok poisonings of 2018 when Covid-19 arrived. For some businesses the pandemic will be the final nail in the coffin for others it is proving to be a relatively minor set-back.“Novichok was even worse than Corona,” said Dave Hancock (33), who with his wife Aimee (27), owns three city venues, including an upmarket B\u0026ampB. “We had armed police with machine guns and cordons right outside our craft beer bar – Danny’s Bar – so no-one wanted to come in,” said Dave.A post-Covid service in Salisbury Cathedral Paul Miles has the full story here.We intend to take our Kia Sorento automatic to Spain for four weeks later this year.

This includes the Eurostar, Paris metro and intercity train services, as well as buses and taxis. Anyone caught without a mask faces a fine of €135 (£122). Some shops and supermarkets have also introduced a rule requiring all customers to wear a face covering on the premises, as have some restaurants (although diners are, naturally, allowed to remove the masks in order to eat).The Notre Dame in ParisIn Italy, the government has ordered that face masks be worn in all indoor public places, including shops and restaurants, and strongly advises that they are worn at all times while out and about. One exception to this is Lombardy: the region was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, accounting for almost half of all Italian fatalities, so it is mandatory to wear a face mask in any public location. A similar rule has been imposed on the island of Capri, although it only applies on weekends.For more details, Tom Mulvihill has rounded up the rules in your favourite holiday destinations. You can also learn how to cope with a face mask in a heatwave here.Portugal has eased its lockdown restrictions further allowing bars and nightclubs to reopen, yet the country remains off limits to British holidaymakers. Authorities said social distancing should still apply in the venues, but there was renewed confidence on efforts to stem the virus after Covid-19 infection rates dropped significantly, with the week\u0027s total of new cases running at 15 per 100,000, nearly half of that a fortnight ago. The UK Government on Thursday confirmed Portugal would remain off the green list, though countries with worse rates were deemed safe. A holiday to the Algarve is still off the cardsPortugal\u0027s islands, Madeira and the Azores, are also still on the red list, requiring quarantine on arrival in the UK, despite boasting even lower rates of infection. Madeira\u0027s tourist board on Friday said it was one of the safest destinations in Europe and has only recorded nine case of coronavirus. From August 1, the island will introduce the mandatory wearing of face masks in public spaces where social distancing cannot be observed.Find the latest advice on travelling to Portugal here.After Spain was unceremoniously dumped from the FCO’s “safe” list at just a few hours’ notice, forcing as many as 600,000 Britons to unexpectedly self-isolate for two weeks, travellers may be reticent about taking the plunge and heading abroad this summer.Luxembourg has since been faced with the same about-turn, and there are concerns that a number of other countries could be next. Could a holiday to the Amalfi Coast be on the cards?Nevertheless, there are a clutch of countries with far fewer cases should you fancy a last-minute holiday that’s highly unlikely to turn into a surprise two-week quarantine when you get back to Blighty.Oliver Smith rounds up the best candidates, including Italy, Greece and Iceland, here.Luxembourg is the second country, following Spain, to be removed from the list of places exempt from the 14-day quarantine. This means that any English holidaymakers returning from the landlocked Western European country from today, July 31, will now be required to self-isolate for two weeks.The Government\u0027s decision to revoke Luxembourg\u0027s status on the green list of air bridges was provoked by a surge in coronavirus cases in the country.

He emphasised that the Government will continue to encourage people to consider alternative means of transport.In depth: Your rights if your employer asks you to go back to workFace coverings are now mandatory in shops, supermarkets, banks and building societies, with fines of up to £100 for anyone who fails to adhere to the new rules. Initially, people did not have to wear face coverings in museums, cinemas, concert halls and theatres when the Government\u0027s rules that came into place on July 24.But on July 31, Mr Johnson announced that face masks had to be worn in museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship and this will be written into law in England on August 8.Visitors to hairdressers, gyms and leisure centres, dentists and opticians will also not be required to wear face coverings.The Government has indicated that the policy could be extended to offices too, but there has been no official announcement relating to that so far. Face coverings are already compulsory on public transport.Face coverings will be needed in some indoor locations, perspex screens could be used between tables in restaurants and al fresco dining will be encouraged to minimise the risk of transmission. There is also hope that at least some social distancing restrictions could be lifted by the end of the year, after the Prime Minister said that he hopes we will be able to review the outstanding restrictions from November at the earliest, possibly in time for Christmas.He also told a press conference on July 17 that the one-metre-plus social distancing rule could be scrapped by November, saying that the Government is hoping for the best and planning for the worst.Since July 4, any two households can meet together under the same roof, and even stay overnight, as long as they observe social distancing. This means families can now invite one set of grandparents over for lunch and then see the other set of grandparents for dinner, as long as they are not there at the same time.The new rule also allows any two households to meet up in a pub, restaurant, museum or cinema, or even go on holiday together. There is no limit on how many people can gather, as long as no more than two households are meeting at the same time.Existing rules allowing up to six people from up to six different households to meet outdoors remain in place, as does the rule that allows someone living alone to join a support bubble (see the \u0027Shielding\u0027 section below) with another household and be treated as if they live in the same home.Boris Johnson has now said that the Government will look to allow more close contact between friends and family where we can, from October onwards and subject to the sustained decline of the virus.Families will be told to choose one member to visit elderly relatives in care homes.New Government guidance for the care sector – which bans flowers and hugs – says homes can begin allowing visitors shortly after they have undergone risk assessments of safety protocols. The advice recommends limiting the numbers of visitors to a single constant visitor per resident, wherever possible. It says: This, for example, means the same family member visiting each time to limit the number of different iniduals coming into contact. Relatives will be told to wear face coverings and follow advice on social distancing as much as possible, keeping at least one metre away and avoiding handshakes, kisses or hugs. Iniduals who test positive for coronavirus or show symptoms must self-isolate for 10 days.The UK Chief Medical Officers extended the time period from seven to 10 days on July 30. They said that evidence - although limited - has strengthened, suggesting that iniduals who are mildly ill with Covid-19 and are recovering have a real possibility of infectiousness between 7 and 9 days after illness onset.In a statement published online, they said: We have considered how best to target interventions to reduce risk to the general population and consider that at this point in the epidemic, with widespread and rapid testing available and considering the relaxation of other measures, it is now the correct balance of risk to extend the self-isolation period from 7 to 10 days for those in the community who have symptoms or a positive test result.This will help provide additional protection to others in the community. This is particularly important to protect those who have been shielding and in advance of the autumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission.The shielding programme, which was designed to protect the most medically vulnerable to the effects of coronavirus, is due to end completely at the end of July. The Prime Minister said that the Government will be sure to restart shielding at any point if it is required at a regional or national level.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, has published a list of countries and territories where the Government has abandoned its 14 day quarantine policy. However countries including Portugal, Canada and the US have been excluded from the list at present.China, Brazil, Sweden and Russia have also been left off the list under a “traffic light” system that allows holidaymakers to travel abroad without having to self-isolate for two weeks when back in England.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said it is that  quite likely that more countries will be added to the red list in the near future. On July 26, it was announced that travellers arriving from Spain will have to self isolate for 14 days upon their return. The following day, the Foreign Office updated its travel advice and warned against all non essential travel to mainland Spain and its surrounding islands including Ibiza and the Canary Islands. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme on July 30, Mr Hancock said that scientists were looking into ways to reduce the quarantine period. In recent days, the  has learnt that under plans being finalised by ministers, quarantine for people arriving from Spain and other countries with high levels of coronavirus will be cut to 10 days.This permits customers to sit closer together in venues in which it is not possible for them to be two metres apart, so long as there are additional mitigating measures in place. Waiters are required to wipe down surfaces more often and collect glasses and plates more frequently. People are discouraged from returning their glass or ordering from the bar, with more table service and mobile apps expected to be introduced. The changes also place limits on the number of people who can sit together indoors in pubs and restaurants, with just two households of any size permitted to drink or eat together. To assist the Test and Trace system, customers will be required to register their details with a venue before entry.In depth: Restaurants and cafes are open - these are the new rules Swimming pools have reopened, and grassroots sports has begun again, meaning people of different households can train and play together. Clubs have to submit an action plan to the Government explaining how they will follow the rules.Gyms and sports facilities are now open again, with enhanced cleaning, timed booking restrictions, reduced class sizes and spaced out equipment.While face coverings remain obligatory on public transport, gym-goers are not be expected to wear theirs while working out. Some gyms might require them - so ask before you go.The Prime Minister has announced that from Aug 1 the Government will pilot larger gatherings in sport stadiums, with a view to a wider reopening in the autumn, noting that the aim is to bring audiences into stadiums from October onwards.In depth: A Covid-safe gym workout – what you can, can\u0027t, and shouldn\u0027t do Schools, nurseries and colleges will all open for all children and young people on a full-time basis from September onwards, with schools in England told to keep classes or whole year groups apart in separate bubbles.Primary schools are encouraged to have bubbles that include a whole class, while secondary schools are likely to need bubbles that consist of an entire year group so the full range of subjects can be delivered.Older children will also be encouraged to keep their distance within groups of students and from staff.Schools have also been advised to stagger break and lunch times, as well as start and finish times, to keep groups apart and avoid creating busy corridors, entrances and exits.Students have been advised to consider alternatives to public transport in the autumn.Parents, staff and pupils will be encouraged to walk or cycle to school if at all possible - and schools have been told to consider using walking buses to reduce the use of public transport.The Prime Minister has said that universities are working to reopen as fully as possible when the autumn term begins in September.In depth: Schools are reopening in September - what does the guidance say?Hair salons have now reopened, but the experience of getting your hair cut is very different.Hairdressers are required to wear a full-face plastic visor to reduce the risk of infection and also need to follow strict rules over the disinfecting of equipment.Customers must usually make appointments, and there are limits on the amount of people in salons. Customers are not obliged to wear a mask, but can if they wish to. In government guidance released on June 24, establishments were advised to implement a series of measures to ensure the safety of guests and staff. Those checking in to hotels should expect to see social distancing stickers on the floor, perspex screens at the reception desk  and hand sanitiser or handwashing facilities as they enter the premises during their stay.The duration of activities such as check-in should now be kept as short as possible, and keys should be cleaned inbetween guest use.  Queues may form outside hotels like they have done outside supermarkets, and hotels have been asked to introduce queuing systems using barriers should they be needed.Larger hotels can opt to stagger check-in and check-out times, or place markers on the floor to maintain social distancing.All paperwork is likely to be removed from rooms, along with the telephone, while the plastic pouch containing tea and coffee sachets will either be removed or quarantined for up to 72 hours between guests.It is thought campsites will ensure that tents are pitched further apart than normal so social distancing measures can be adhered to, along with frequent deep cleaning of facility blocks such as showers. Some campsites will be required to reduce the number of pitches to keep numbers down.Campsites in Wales reopened on July 6, while those in Scotland reopened on July 15.  Britain\u0027s theatres, galleries and music venues will receive a £1.57 billion rescue package, which Boris Johnson said will help them while their doors remain closed and curtains remain down.The Prime Minister described the arts as the beating heart of this country as he announced a package of grants in July amid warnings that many venues could fold without urgent government support.Once inside, families and friends who book together will be allowed to sit with each other at screenings, but it is likely that seats will be kept free between different bookings. However, there will be no pick \u0027n\u0027 mix or other self-service snacks.In depth: This is what the Covid cinema experience is actually like The majority of other leisure settings were preparing to reopen from Aug 1 as part of the Government\u0027s roadmap.Bowling alleys, skating rinks and casinos would be allowed to reopen then, the Prime Minister said earlier in July.But on July 31, a day after parts of the north of England were plunged back into lockdown, Mr Johnson said that these plans were on hold. The reopening plans will be revisited on Aug 15.All of the above premises are expected to have \u0027Covid-secure\u0027 measures in place, which will most likely involve limitations on customer capacity.But not all leisure settings will be able to reopen even under the updated guidance.Nightclubs and soft play areas sadly need to remain closed for now, Mr Johnson said in July, although added that this will be kept under review.Churches are being encouraged to implement a booking system, meaning people may need to reserve their space ahead of services.Worshippers are also advised to bring their own bible or holy book to their place of worship with them. Where worshippers are unable to do so, books should be cleaned and quarantined for 48 hours since their previous use. Muslims should also bring their own prayer mat to services.Communion is allowed if it is deemed \u0027essential,\u0027 but worshippers should not drink from the same glass or share the same bread, which could come pre-wrapped. The priest distributing communion should wear gloves and all those involved in the practice should wash their hands before and after.No hymns should be sung or wood instruments used as they create an “additional risk of infection”.For Christenings and other water rituals, only “small volumes” should be splashed onto the body with full immersion avoided. Those present should stand “distant from any splashes” and all those involved should thoroughly wash their hands before and after such ceremonies. Parents should hold their children throughout the Christening service. Small weddings and civil partnership ceremonies can now take place, with groups of less than 30. That number includes the couple, witnesses, officiants, guests. photographers, security or caterers. It does not include staff employed by the venue.Those ceremonies will have to be staid affairs, as guests should avoid singing, shouting or raising their voices during the ceremonies, while the bride and groom must wash their hands before and after exchanging rings.The guidelines also state that only one person is permitted to sing during the ceremony and they should do so from behind a perspex screen. Spoken responses during marriages or civil partnerships should also not be in a raised voice, the guidance says. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission from aerosol and droplets.Fathers may not be able to walk their daughters down the aisle unless they live under the same roof.The orders of service will be disposable and cash donations will be discouraged, meaning those wanting to support the happy couple should do so online. Under the new rules, weddings and civil partnerships should be concluded in the “shortest possible time” and limited to the “legally binding” sections of the service.Receptions or parties after weddings - which have so far not not been permitted - were set to be allowed for up to 30 people from the start of August, provided that they take place in a Covid-secure way.These have now been postponed until Aug 15 at the earliest. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/14/11/two-metre.jpg","title":"coronavirus workplace safety shielding workers","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Employees with conditions such as diabetes and severe asthma are anxious about a sudden return to workplaces after months of barely leaving homeAfter being hospitalised three times this year with severe asthma attacks, as well as having diabetes brought on by long-term use of steroid medication, 49-year-old David Keane*, cannot afford to take any chances with Covid-19.But, on Monday, following changes to government guidance, he will be going back into his workplace, as a manager for a shipping company.Having shielded for four months, and stuck to the rules “to the letter”, he is - like many who are clinically very vulnerable to coronavirus - nervous about a sudden return to work, even though he has been with his current employer for 30 years.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I want to go back. I\u0027m one of these people that\u0027s always working, even if I\u0027m on holiday I keep in touch by email. I manage a team so I have responsibility but because I\u0027ve been on furlough I\u0027ve had to be completely cut off. “They turned off my emails overnight. I felt like I\u0027d had a limb chopped off. I went from being busy getting up in the morning to nothing. Not going out at all.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“Now I\u0027m back on Monday and it\u0027s quite a strange sensation. The only buildings I\u0027ve been in in the last four months are my house, the hospital and the dentist. I\u0027ve not even been in a shop.”Keane is far from alone. Among all of the 2.2 million people who have been shielding, 43 per cent have not left their home and garden, according to figures compiled by a coalition of charities including Diabetes UK and Age UK.The charities wrote to the chancellor on Friday calling for protections for 595,000 clinically vulnerable people who normally work, to ensure they are not pressured to go back to unsafe workplaces.Keane thinks the government should encourage a more staged reintroduction to workplaces for people who have been shielding.Constant changes to government guidance have given mixed messages which have served to undermine the confidence of many people who are shielding, he says.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That hasn\u0027t helped the shielding community at all.“We had the changes from 2-metre to 1-metre social distancing, then people were allowed to travel and we see Bournemouth beach packed, there was the face mask fiasco and now they\u0027ve said this week people coming back from Spain have to quarantine, having said a few days before that they didn’t.”“It’s a big step. I’ve got a real mixture of emotions.He says he feels his employer has done what it can to implement social distancing measures, increase cleaning, introduced hand sanitiser stations hygiene and help people stay safe at work.“Until I go back, I just don\u0027t know. It\u0027s going to be suck it and see. But the shipping industry is pretty good on health and safety. Many others are not so fortunate. Cancer patients ‘forced to choose between health or finances’One in seven workers with a lung condition feel so unsafe that they say they will refuse to return to their workplace, even if this means they lose their job, according to a survey by Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation.One third of the 8,500 people polled do not believe their workplace is or will be “Covid-secure”. Almost seven in 10 of those who said they were concerned about going back to work said they believe they will have to do so anyway.The government has published guidelines for employers to follow, but Keane believes the messages on what “Covid-secure” actually means have been unclear and contradictory.Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation are urging employers to be understanding with their employees who have a lung condition and engage with their inidual needs. This could include an ongoing option to work at home or redeployment to a lower risk role.The charities are among a growing chorus of voices calling on government to do more.Chris Askew, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: “No one should be faced with the impossible task of choosing between their health, by returning to work in an unsafe environment, and their financial security.“The government must ensure that employers are supported to take all the necessary measures to keep all employees safe if they are expected to attend work outside their home. “In addition, the government should introduce a new support scheme for those clinically vulnerable people who are unable to return to a safe work environment.”Sarah MacFadyen, head of policy at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, wants the government to consider extending the furlough scheme for people who have been shielding, but so far the government has ignored that call.“This group of people have already made huge sacrifices and need to be to be supported to make their own personal decision about whether to return to the workplace.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was meeting later Friday with the leaders of Spain\u0027s regions to discuss how to rebuild the economy and where to deploy billions of euros in European Union aid for recovery.UK economy has recovered around half of its coronavirus hitSpain in mid-March went into a more than three-month lockdown, bringing much economic activity to a halt, as Covid-19 cases and deaths surged. The lockdown ended 21 June.France also reported a precipitous 14 per cent contraction in the second quarter when the country was in lockdown.In France, the startling plunge of 13.8 per cent in April-June from the previous three-month period also starkly illustrated the punishing economic cost of its two-month lockdown. It was the third consecutive quarter of economic contraction in France\u0027s worsening recession. The pain has been so damaging to jobs and industries that the government is talking down the possibility of another nationwide lockdown as infections tick upward again.Analysts forecast that Europe\u0027s economic recovery is unlikely to be rapid. Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said: There are few silver linings in the data published today, which confirm that euro-zone GDP slumped just as much as feared in the second quarter and that inflation remained well below target. While parts of the economy have sprung back to life over the past couple of months, the damage already done combined with the current and potential future impact of the virus mean that the recovery will be painfully slow.Given the rebound since April, our best guess is that economic activity is now some 5-10 per cent below its pre-virus level in the euro-zone as a whole – it is hard to be more precise than that.The latest official figures for the UK showed a 25 per cent plunge in GDP during March and April but there are signs that a partial recovery has begun.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Potential uses of the helicopter could include scouting ahead of human explorers and  investigating caves and craters. It could also be used to carry small payloads across the planet.Life could exist beneath the surface of Mars, study claimsBy the way, we just had an earthquake in this room, MiMi Aung said. Although objects were rattled, but there has been no significant effects on the launch of the rocket.On Nasa\u0027s livestream, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine noted it was lucky that the rocket was not launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base, which is also in California and has seen Nasa launches before.Many viewers commented on Twitter that the earthquake was a benefit, as it woke them up in time to watch the Perseverance mission launch.Nasa can only go to Mars once every 26 months, so missing this launch window would mean a cost of half a billion dollars to maintain the rover before it could launch again.The trip to Mars had already been delayed twice before, because of contamination problems and issues with a crane at the pad.More news can be found on The Independent\u0027s liveblog of the launch.The Nasa mission will send the rover Perseverence to search for traces of potential alien life.The car-sized six-wheeled robotic rover, ]will launch atop an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance.Officials indicated that all systems appeared ready to go ahead of the launch, with weather forecasts from the Air Force\u0027s 45th Weather Squadron remaining at an 80 percent probability of launch and fuelling preparations underway for the rocket.Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars - once a much more hospitable place than it is today - ever harboured life.Why Nasa\u0027s new Mars rover will be its best yetWater is considered a key ingredient for life, and the Martian surface billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost.However, scientists are unsure whether alien life could have survived in the water. Although the waters in Martian lakes appear to have a similar pH to that in Earth\u0027s oceans, other scientists have argued that it would be far too cold for life to survive.One of the most complex manoeuvres in Perseverance\u0027s journey will be what mission engineers call the “seven minutes of terror,” when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet\u0027s surface.It is the latest launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China.Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has grown to 104 confirmed cases in six parts of the country, including three of the largest cities, forcing authorities to reimpose virus restrictions.Vietnam\u0027s health ministry announced on Thursday that a 70-year-old man had died after contracting coronavirus while being treated for a kidney illness at the Da Nang hospital.Da Nang is Vietnam\u0027s most popular beach destination, and thousands of visitors were in the city for summer vacation. Across the country, authorities are rushing to test people who have returned home from the coastal city, which was put under lockdown on Tuesday.West Yorkshire Police Federation chair criticises government\u0027s \u0027haphazard announcements\u0027 of new restrictionsYet again we are struggling to police - and get to grips with - what can only be described as haphazard announcements made by the Government in relation to tighter Covid-19 restrictions, Brian Booth said in a statement.It is an absolute nonsense that we as the police service have not been afforded the time to put things in place prior to an announcement.Many people in Kirklees, Calderdale and Bradford will have woken up this morning to the news that they are subject to tighter restrictions on their lives. And it will be up to my colleagues to police these restrictions.We must also remember that a lot of the areas subject to lockdown have communities who would have been intending to celebrate Eid and who will now be disappointed by this announcement. And it will be our West Yorkshire Police colleagues who will now be on the front line of having to manage the situation and stop separate households from meeting each other at their homes.One third of Edinburgh Airport staff to lose jobsGordon Dewar, chief executive of Edinburgh Airport, has said one-third of his 750 staff are to lose their jobs, travel correspondent Simon Calder\u0026nbspreports.“This is a bitterly sad day for the airport and for those colleagues who are losing their jobs through no fault of their own but due to the impact of this dreadful pandemic, he said.“The situation has been exacerbated by the introduction of an ill-thought out and unworkable blanket quarantine policy which has massively impacted on passenger numbers.“It will be a very long road to recovery, and we cannot successfully make that journey while we are set up as a 15 million-passenger airport.\u0026nbsp“Aviation jobs rely on passengers and flights. That has been lost in this argument.”Mike Kane, MP for Wythenshawe and Sale East and shadow transport minister, said the way the new Covid-19 restrictions were announced was a complete shambles.He told PA news agency: As much as I always support the government, it\u0027s a complete shambles the way it was announced.It\u0027s been released on social media with hours notice. It puts people in a place of uncertainty, fear and confusion.\u0026nbspHe said local MPs were invited by regional public health officials on Thursday morning to discuss how the pandemic was affecting the area, but he said no one had known about the impending new restrictions that were announced that evening.\u0026nbspThe government has got to do better than this in informing people and give people the heads up, he added.\u0026nbspThese things shouldn\u0027t be binary, it shouldn\u0027t be switched on and then switched off.Up to 30 people allowed to meet outdoors in WalesUp to 30 people will be allowed to meet outside in Wales while maintaining social distancing from Monday.Mark Drakeford said children under the age of 11 will also no longer need to keep to the two-metre rule while outdoors due to the falling transmission rate.The first minister said the changes would help family and friends but would be restricted to outside locations because we know it\u0027s much safer to be meeting in the outdoors and the sunlight.The latest set of relaxed measures comes alongside the reopening of indoor service for pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes from Monday.Mr Drakeford told Sky News: We believe we have some further headroom. The circulation of the virus in Wales continues to fall.That gives us the opportunity to reopen bars, restaurants, cafes and so on, indoors, and to afford some extra flexibility to family and friends to meet in the outdoors.Asked if he agreed with comments by a Tory MP in one of the impacted areas\u0026nbspclaiming that the BAME community was not taking the situation seriously enough,\u0026nbspMr Johnson said: On your first point about ... are certain communities responding enough to the guidance - well, I think it\u0027s up to all of us in government to make sure that the message is being heard loud and clear by everybody across the country, and to make sure that everybody is complying withthe guidance.Govt will \u0027come down hard\u0027 on workplaces that aren\u0027t Covid secureMr Johnson told the briefing: I want to see people discussing with their employers whether they can work from home.But if employers think and employees think to be productive you need to be at your place of work then that’s a very important consideration and it is safe to get into a Covid-secure workplace.\u0026nbspIt goes without saying, if people feel that there workplace isn’t secure then the HSE is there to enforce it. If employers don’t keep their workplaces Covid secure then that’s a matter that can be enforced in law and we will come down hard on people who are not doing the right thing.Mr Johnson admitted the government should be explaining things as clearly as possible, after there was confusion over last night\u0027s announcement about the north of England.He said: Of course we\u0027ve got to make sure that we explain things as crisply and as clearly as we can.The prime minister reiterated his new mantra of\u0026nbsphands, face, space, get a test.Professor Chris Whitty says we have reached the limits in terms of opening up society.He added: The idea that we can open up everything and keep the virus under control is clearly wrong.Plans to pause shielding will go ahead as planned and people are still being encouraged to return to work, the prime minister said.More details on this are expected to come later today.The wearing of face coverings will become mandatory in cinemas, museums, and places of worship from next weekend, Boris Johnson has announced.The prime minister said regulations would be extended to cover the new areas from Saturday 8 August.\u0026nbspMr Johnson says the new restrictions in the north of England shouldn\u0027t be seen as a return to lockdown.He says children going back to school is the right thing and that it should be a national priority.The PM says the government will implement local lockdowns as necessary to stop the spread of the virus.Further easing of lockdown postponedBoris Johnson has announced further easing of lockdown restrictions planned for 1 August will no longer go ahead as planned.The prime minister said they would be postponed for at least a fortnight until 15 August.This includes plans to reopen casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks, to allow indoor performances to resume, and to allow wedding receptions of up to 30 people.Sports events to pilot the return of fans have also been cancelled.\u0026nbspHe told a Downing Street press conference: I\u0027ve consistently warned this virus could come back and we would not hesitate to take swift and isive action.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is what gives the bubble its glow.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThese high temperatures are caused by radiation from the nebula’s parent star, the ESO says. That causes the hydrogen gas to glow red around the oxygen gas, which glows blue.The space butterfly is located between 3000 and 6500 light-years away, in the Southern constellation of Vela – otherwise known as The Sails. It has two central stars, which is what gives it its striking, near-symmetrical shape.Only around 10 to 20 percent of all nebulae have this kind of bipolar shape.Planetary nebulae are formed when ancient stars, which can have mass six times greater than The Sun, collapse and expel vast quantities of gas. Ultraviolet radiation causes this gas to shine brightly until they are dispersed through space. On the cosmic timescale, these events happen very quickly.This phenomenon was captured by the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile, specifically the FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph (FORS) telescope attached to it.The FORS is one of four telescopes that makes up the VLT and is 8.2-metres long.Why Nasa\u0027s new Mars rover will be its best yetA new space race is here – and let’s hope it can peacefulRecently, astronomers also spotted another beautiful, unique event: a blast of ultraviolet light following the explosion of a white dwarf.Astronomers have only been able to see an event like that once before, but hope that it will be able to reveal the secrets of the universe, including how our own planet formed around its iron core, as well as the effects of dark energy.Dark energy is a mysterious force that seems to have made the expansion rate of our universe increase, rather than slow down. This energy comprises 70 percent of all the energy in the universe but is still relatively unknown to scientists.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The statue of Robert Baden-Powell on Poole Quay is to be placed in safe storage following concerns about his racial viewsIt added: While the percentage of iniduals testing positive for Covid-19 has decreased since the start of the study (26 April 2020), there is now evidence to suggest that it has been rising slightly in recent weeks.It comes as the government calls on households in areas of the north of England to no longer mix with others in private residences and hospitality businesses.Meanwhile planned easing of restrictions around wedding receptions and indoor entertainment businesses have been put on hold, and face masks will be mandatory in cinemas, museums, and places of worship from next weekend.Commenting on the figures at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said: “Around one in 1,500 now have the virus compared to one in 1,800 on the 15 of July and one in 2,000 on the 2nd of July. The ONS also estimate that there are now 4,900 new infections every day, up from around 3,000 per day on the 14 of July and 2,000 per day at the end of June.We just can’t afford to ignore this evidence” he added, saying it was “vital to stress of course that we are in a far better position to keep the virus under control now than we were at the start of the pandemic”Office for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I literally got the message at his memorial so it was a double crappy day\u0027\u0026nbsp“I have lost five kilos in the last three or four weeks because of stress and because work has been so hostile,” Lottie Pope tells The Independent. “I feel like it is bullying. I go to bed at 11pm and wake up at 3am and can’t go back to sleep because my brain is frantic. It is exploding with stress.”Ms Pope, a former social media manager for an insurance firm, was recently laid off from her job during the public health emergency and believes she was discriminated against for being a mother.A spate of recent studies have suggested the coronavirus crisis is exacerbating gender inequality - with a report by the University of Exeter finding women are almost twice as likely as men to have lost their job during the pandemic. Researchers found seven per cent of women have been made redundant during the lockdown in comparison to four per cent of men.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile a report by PwC, published in May, found 78 per cent of those who had already lost their jobs as a result of the Covid-19 emergency were women.“At the beginning of the lockdown, we were asked to take a 20 per cent pay cut,” Ms Pope, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, says. “I said: \u0027I can’t afford that because I’ve got childcare to pay for\u0027. And then they said: \u0027You have a choice to be put on furlough or be made redundant\u0027. It was a punishment. I also asked them if could I reduce my hours by 20 per cent because I was homeschooling but they expected me to still be full-time.”The women facing lockdown burnout as they juggle jobs with childcareThe 30-year-old, who is a single parent, said hours earlier she had been told she was “critical” to the company and would be working throughout the crisis. But her bosses attitude changed dramatically when she did not agree to take the pay cut, she added.“Social media is a critical, vital thing which can definitely be done from home,“ the mother-of-one adds. ”I had a junior person below me and they kept the junior person. She doesn’t have kids. I feel like it was a case of them discriminating against me because I have a child. I was homeschooling and working full time from home at the beginning of the lockdown. It was so stressful. Now I’m not sleeping at all. I feel really highly strung and I’m very worried about money. I’ve filed a grievance. I can’t take them to an employment tribunal because I worked there for under two years.”A recent London School of Economics study found women are more likely than men to lose their jobs in the forthcoming recession because a greater proportion work in sectors that are forecast to be most badly affected. More women work in hospitality, leisure, tourism and the arts — industries where thousands of workers have already been furloughed or made redundant.Jamie Bird, who lives in West London and previously worked in the education sector, was furloughed in March before being laid off in June.  “I was laid off on the anniversary of my best friend\u0027s death,” the 38-year-old adds. I literally got the message at his memorial so it was a double crappy day. I\u0027ve been feeling pretty down since losing the job. I don\u0027t have any kids but it\u0027s affected my mental health a lot. I\u0027ve lost a job and a relationship so it\u0027s been hard dealing with both. I don\u0027t sleep as well because obviously I\u0027m worried about finding another job and how I\u0027m going to pay for bills and other expenses.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe gender bias revealed by coronavirus needs fixingMs Bird said the current job market is “awful” and she fears she is being discriminated against due to her age - adding that it feels like employers are taking on apprentices due to them being cheaper than someone who has more experience.“I applied for universal credit but was denied any for reasons they haven\u0027t explained so I\u0027m out of a job with no income and no help and that\u0027s tough,” she adds. “I think that it\u0027s atrocious that women are more likely to lose their job in the pandemic than men, we work equally as hard and sometimes even harder and yet we still don\u0027t seem to have bridged that gap between being treated as equally in the workplace environment.” Gemma Hirst, who lives in Newcastle, has been forced to start claiming universal credit since losing her job in retail during the coronavirus crisis.“I worked for the clothes company for five years and got promoted,” the 25-year-old says. “During lockdown, I got furloughed. A couple of months down the line, the shop I was at was closing down but they said I could be moved to another store. But they cut my hours and demoted me so I was no longer a supervisor. I didn’t want that so they made me redundant”.Ms Hirst said she had never lost a job before or been without work but she lucky enough to live with her parents - adding that if she was living alone, the universal credit would not be enough to live on.“It would be a tough existence,” she says. “It is scary because there are hardly any jobs out there. When I apply for jobs I get emails saying that the application is on pause due to the pandemic. I have no idea what would happen if I didn\u0027t have family. It doesn’t bear thinking about. I think I would be homeless. I have good days and bad days. There are some days where I think ‘what am I going to do?’ and I am anxious about the future and worried about what is to come.”She said her best friend, who has three children, had been catapulted into a state of panic since being laid off from her job in a care home for the elderly.  “She was struggling to get childcare and her employer said we don’t want you,” Ms Hirst adds. “She was crying. She is a wreck because she has three children to look after on her own.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”.

Parts of the country will be warmer than popular tourist destinations in Europe, including Berlin, Lisbon and Ibiza, where temperatures will reach 25C, 30C and 33C respectively. The weather will be hottest in southeastern areas of the UK and will peak at 35C in Greater London. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe mercury will also rise above 30C in Manchester and parts of Wales. However, it will be slightly cooler in some western areas of the UK because of cloud cover, according to Alex Deakin, a meteorologist at the Met Office. Windy and wet week could end with hottest day of the yearIn places where conditions are warmer, Mr Deakin said there is a chance of thunderstorms forming later in the day. Across the Midlands, eastern and southern England, that\u0027s where we have the risk that the heat and humidity could trigger some big, big thunderstorms, Mr Deakin said. But for most places, it\u0027s all about the heat really, he added. A cold front swinging in from the west will bring a significant drop in temperatures on Saturday, when London and Manchester will have highs of 26C and 21C respectively. The good weather on Friday comes at the end of a July which has had above average rain and below average temperatures and sunshine. So far this month, the maximum temperature has been 28.5C, which was recorded at Heathrow Airport on 17 July.

We ignore these warnings at our peril.”The sudden imposition of new rules for the northern regions - enforceable with fines of up to £100 – was heavily criticised, with Labour’s Lisa Nandy saying she “could not describe the level of chaos” in her Wigan constituency after the announcement, which came hours before the first day of Eid.The head of the Muslim Council of Britain, Harun Khan, said that the timing felt to Muslims “like being told they cannot visit family and friends for Christmas on Christmas Eve itself”.“Failure to communicate makes it difficult for communities across the country to continue working together to minimise the spread of the virus, whilst eroding trust in the ability of authorities to steer our course,” Mr Khan added.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailAnd while Labour leader Keir Starmer attacked the government for not asking pubs to close, Tory MPs also turned on ministers over the blanket imposition of measures across Greater Manchester despite low infection rates in some areas.But Matt Hancock, who announced the measures in a series of tweets at 9.15pm and a short TV appearance, defended the imposition of new restrictions at midnight.“We made the announcement last night, we are moving quickly in some circumstances and I think that’s very important and it’s one of the things that when you face a pandemic like this, it is important sometimes to move quickly, if that’s what’s needed,” the health secretary said.After widespread outrage over the lack of detail in the initial announcement – which Mr Hancock defended as “crystal clear” despite appearing to get the new rules wrong himself in a BBC interview – the prime minister gave a further announcement on Thursday afternoon.Mr Johnson postponed the planned lifting of further restrictions in England on Friday for at least another fortnight, saying it was time to “squeeze the brake pedal” on the return to normality as he announced the wearing of face coverings would become mandatory in cinemas, museums, and places of worship from next weekend.Whitty: We have ‘probably’ reached the ‘limits of what we can do in terms of opening up society’The prime minister suggested the daily number of new infections in the community may have more than doubled over the last month – with England seeing 4,900 new infections every day, compared to around 2,000 per day at the end of June.His announcement came shortly after new Office for National Statistics data also suggested a small rise in the number of infections across the country in recent weeks.England’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty flanked the prime minister on Thursday, warning: “I think what we’re seeing from the data from ONS and other data is that we have probably reached near the limit or the limits of what we can do in terms of opening up society.“So what that means potentially is that if we wish to do more things in the future, we may have to do less of some other things. And these will be difficult trade-offs, some of which will be decisions for government and some of which are for all of us as citizens to do.“But we have to be realistic about this. The idea that we can open up everything and keep the virus under control is clearly wrong.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The statue of Robert Baden-Powell on Poole Quay is to be placed in safe storage following concerns about his racial viewsHowever, health secretary Matt Hancock insisted he was right to act quickly and comprehensively when evidence emerged of increased levels of coronavirus due to households mingling in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and east Lancashire.The announcement of a regional ban on indoor meetings between members of different households - which also covered the city of Leicester - was made at around 9.15pm on Thursday via a string of tweets and a short TV clip by the health secretary.It followed phone conferences involving Mr Hancock, health experts and local leaders including mayors and MPs for the areas affected, as well as a meeting with the prime minister at Downing Street. As discussions continued, a planned press conference to announce the outcome of a review of local lockdown in Leicester was repeatedly delayed, prompting mayor Sir Peter Soulsby to accused ministers of messing the city about and declaring: “What a way to run a country!”Where are the new lockdown restrictions and what are the rules?Indoor gatherings banned in northern England amid spike in casesExact details of the new restrictions were not published on the gov.uk website until Friday morning, hours after they came into effect. As Mr Hancock took to the airwaves at breakfast time, it was revealed that Boris Johnson and chief medical officer would answer questions about the changes in a press conference at 10 Downing Street at noon that day.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But I cannot describe to you the level of chaos that there was last night with this announcement, because the government was essentially asking people to comply with new rules in just a few hours’ time without any detail about what those rules were going to be.”Tracy Brabin, Labour MP for Batley and Spen in West Yorkshire, said the way the new lockdown measures had been announced was “deeply chaotic”.She said: “To announce this sort of measure late at night on Twitter caused an awful lot of anxiety in my community. It’s a new low.“It affects millions (of people) and businesses. I have been getting messages from families asking ‘can I take my children to the childminder?’, ‘can I go to work?’... It has caused a lot of anxiety.”In a press conference today, Sir Peter Soulsby said there was still confusion in Leicester about what was allowed: “I’m sure lots of people in Leicester will not have a clear understanding of what was announced yesterday and what it means for them.“I think the fact the timing of the decision was put back several times – and even when it came out, the bit about Leicester was very much an afterthought in a bigger statement - leaves a lot of uncertainty and a lot of frustration.” Meanwhile, Conservative MP for the Greater Manchester constituency of Hazel Grove, William Wragg, said: “Greater Manchester is not one homogeneous area. We must always err on the side of caution with Covid, but to treat all 10 boroughs the same is not the right approach.”Notably, his comment was retweeted by the influential chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, who added: “I agree. Latest update for Trafford says ‘infections continue to be at a low level’.”The mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham backed the government’s action, but was critical about the manner of its announcement.“They have a habit of saying something and then it being a few hours until the detail emerges,” he told Sky News.“And that certainly was the case last night, and later on last night a lot of people I think felt very uncertain about what exactly was being announced.“So what I would say to them is ‘I understand the need to make announcements, I understand the need for decisive action, but when ministers go in front of the cameras, make sure you’ve got the detail ready to go exactly at the same time’.”Mr Hancock defended his handling of the new restrictions: “We made the announcement last night, we are moving quickly in some circumstances and I think that’s very important and it’s one of the things that when you face a pandemic like this, it is important sometimes to move quickly, if that’s what’s needed.“And I’m pleased that Andy Burnham is supporting this action. It’s absolutely necessary and of course sometimes we have to move quickly when we can see the growth of the virus and I understand the impact of decisions like these.“I understand that this is not a sort of decision that anybody would want to take, but as we’ve seen before, it is important to move quickly because the virus spreads and you’ve got to make sure you do everything you can do keep ahead of it.”Mr Hancock insisted the new guidelines were “crystal clear”, but appeared to get the details wrong in an interview with the BBC in which he said a household in an affected area could travel to visit another household outside the area, as long as social distancing guidelines are followed.The guidance published by the government states: “If you live in the affected areas, you should not visit someone’s home or garden regardless of whether this is in or outside of the restricted area.”MPs for affected areas said that there was no clarity within their constituencies about what was now allowed or not allowed.Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell said people had been asking her whether they were able to visit elderly relatives they are looking after who live outside of the restricted area, and whether they can go on holiday with another household elsewhere.Describing the launch of the regional restrictions as “a bit of a disaster”, she said: “Shockingly bad comms with potentially devastating consequences for many. We need to be continually cautious but we also need confidence and clarity.”Huddersfield MP Barry Sheerman said he backed the tighter controls, but found it impossible to get clarity on them in the hours after the announcement, tweeting late on Thursday: “Receiving many questions about the tightened lockdown, unfortunately very little information provided by the government and I am urgently seeking answers.”Stalybridge and Hyde MP Jonathan Reynolds said: “I have to say a few tweets from a minister late at night is not the way to announce something as significant as this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That allows researchers to build up a picture of all matter in the universe, of which some 90 per cent is invisible, made up of dark matter and tenuous gas.That in turn allows astronomers to watch the processes that gradually make the universe less homogenous, or evenly distributed: parts of the universe that have more than the usual mass attract matter from their areas around them, which makes them less similar to those other parts. The expansion of the universe counteracts that growth.Scientists find they don’t know how fast the universe is expandingSince both of those processes are driven by gravity, they can be used to test the standard model of cosmology and the assumptions underlying our physics. Since that allows us to predict the way that the variations in density would change as the universe aged, those predictions can be put to the test by examining how homogenous or differently clumped the universe really is.The new study found, however, that those predictions were wrong. The universe is almost 10 per cent more homogenous than our current understanding of physics suggests.Like other recent findings, such as the mysterious discrepancy in the expansion rate of the universe or Hubble constant, the data could be yet another crack in the standard model of physics, and could require us to rethink our picture of the universe.“The question is whether these can be solved with a small adjustment, for example with a somewhat more complex behavior of dark matter than the simple hypothesis of totally inert ‘cold dark matter\u0027, said Tilman Tröster, from the University of Edinburgh, in a statement.But the change could be far more fundamental, suggesting for instance that Einstein’s general theory of relativity could need replacing.The researchers behind the new observations were keen to stress that their focus was on accurately taking the measurements, rather than making any leaps about what they could tell us about the universe – or what they could tell us about what we have got wrong about it.As an observing cosmologist, you try to remain impartial and make the measurements as accurate as possible without theoretical prejudices, said Hendrik Hildebrandt from Ruhr University Bochum.One thing is clear: we live in exciting times!”Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

There is still a one in 1,000 chance that the results came about because they looked at an especially strange part of the universe.That extra data will arrive soon, when the final legacy KiDS map is published.

Even before the postponement of the election was confirmed, opposition figures had cautioned that any such move would be treated with suspicion.On Thursday, the Hong Kong government had already barred 12 influential opposition figures from running for seats on the city\u0027s Legislative Council.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Much of the law is considered to be tailor-made to target and criminalise those leading the protests. China\u0027s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said the law would be a sharp sword hanging over the heads of a tiny number of people endangering national security.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was happy to pose and must have known we could never suspect what a terrible man he really was.#It is scary to know now that he was a rapist of an elderly woman and targeted children. We couldnt have known that he was such a monster in truth.#Police removed a huge skip-full of evidence for analysis from the allotment dig site before the search was called off yesterday.

She said to me ‘I’m worried I am sleeping on a dead body’.”A neighbour, who did not wish to be named, told the Mirror: “She is convinced Inga is under there. That cellar was built by a previous tenant.#Christian B removed the floorboards and jumped into it.#There was loads of rubbish inside and he added to it. The new tenant is in such a panic.#She has spent a week sleeping outside.#British cops have questioned the owner of a garage where Christian B worked as a car mechanic.Met Police officers investigating Madeleine McCann’s disappearance left with all paperwork relating to the German paedophile earlier this year.Christian B rented a garage at Euro Hobbywerkstatt in Hanover, a few miles from the allotment currently being excavated.The owner said yesterday detectives “took away everything” to do with him.The suspect modied his VW camper van to be able to hide a child, it is feared.The paedophile lived in the vehicle above a basement at an allotment in Hanover around the time three-year-old Madeleine disappeared.He once boasted he could have used his VW campervan to transport children.Dein Ghafou, who owned a garage complex Hanover used by Christian B, told police: “I told them he had been working on a ­Volkswagen Camper here and he would lt the roof up and then make it smaller again,# he told the Mirror.“He was always cutting the roof, raising it and then lowering it. He came and went here.#Neighbours of Christian B at the allotment said he lived in the VW LT camper van in  and .There has been speculation that police will soon launch a search of another allotment kept by Christian B in the city of Braunschweig, around  miles east of Hanover.Christian B rented the land for around three years until , and for a time is thought to have lived in a single-storey building on the plot.The site is rumoured to have a cellar beneath it similar to the one found beneath the allotment in Hanover.Forensic officers and snfer dog have spent three days hunting through the first known allotment owned by the convicted paedophile in Hanover, Germany.The main suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann buried USB sticks filled with child abuse images alongside his dead dog, reports say.The stash was reportedly found when police searched the site of an abandoned box factory where the alleged killer is known to have stayed in his caravan.The spot is only  miles away from the remote village of Neuwegersleben, where the abandoned box factory is situated.In February , more than  officers took part in a search of the site in search of Gehrickes body, German tabloid Bild reported.No body was uncovered, but police did dig up , pieces of potential evidence relating to other crimes and thought to have been buried by Christian B.Among that evidence is reported to a cache of child abuse images stored on a number of USB sticks which had been buried under a pile of animal bones.Christian B was prosecuted in relation to the images.Christian B has submitted another request for parole just days after withdrawing his application claiming he had lost confidence in the judicial system.The convicted rapist and paedophile was eligible for release in June after serving two thirds of a  month sentence for drugs trafficking.But his lawyer Friedrich Fulscher pulled that application saying he had no faith in the court that would consider the request as it was the same one that had convicted his client of rape.Last night Mr Fulscher, who has refused to speak with British media, told German news outlets he had resubmitted the request but at the court in Kiel where Brueckner is currently jailed.The U turn came just days after he definitely announced no charges would be brought against Brueckner and that prosecutors were chasing up a blind alley.An allotment being searched in Germanys Hanover is an hours drive from the town of Braunschweig, the last fixed home of Christian B.The public prosecutors office in Braunschweig told The Sun Online the forensic investigation was linked to the probe into Madeleine, who vanished in Portugal  years ago.Christian B, , was identied last month as being the prime suspect in her abduction.German police have repeatedly said with confidence they know Madeleine in dead, and they believe Christian B is their man.He settled in Hanover in  after leaving Portugal, and began living in a caravan while working in a car repair shop before being convicted of forgery of documents that same year.Hanover’s district court sentenced Christian B for falsying documents in , and then three years later he was sentenced for a joint theft.Christian B is a lelong paedo who chased a fantasy playboy lestyle to cover up his warped sex crimes, The Sun reported last month.The German criminal was first convicted of abusing children aged  back in  – a year before he is believed to have moved to Portugal.He moved to Braunschweig in  and opened a kiosk in the city, which is around  miles from Hanover.Staff at the kiosk recalled his bizarre and chilling behaviour.A former neighbour of the career criminal said he was “often very aggressive”.The woman who uses a second plot linked to Christian B, Sabine Sellig, has urged police to come and search the site.Her friend Thomas Tager told The Sun: “She is terried.“She has begged police to come with search dogs.“She said to me ‘I’m worried I am sleeping on a dead body’.”Its been reported by Bild that Christian B. leased a second garden plot, in Braunschweig.He is said to have rented it from the Kennelblick Allotment Garden Association from October  until April .The associations boss, Juergen Kruimstoh, told The Sun he remembered Christian B when he frequented the site.He said Christian B paid just £ a year to rent the entire allotment – and he “never had a cross word” with him.Recalling he owned a Mercedes sprinter van and had two dogs, Mr Kruimstoh told The Sun: “His departure from here in  was strange.“He gave me notice in the afternoon, got into his packed, small car, and after that I never heard from him again.“Naturally there is a good deal of speculation about whether the police want to dig here like they have been doing in Hanover.”This week’s forensic investigation of an abandoned allotment in Germany is the latest in a series of searches in relation to the abduction of Madeleine McCann  years ago.Local gardening association boss, Juergen Kruimstoh said Christian B paid £ a year to rent the entire allotment in Hanover years ago. MrKruimstoh said he “never had a cross word” with Christian B. Recalling he owned a Mercedes sprinter van and had two dogs, Mr Kruimstoh told The Sun: “I was shocked when I suddenly saw his picture while searching for Maddie in the spring.“His departure from here in  was strange.“He gave me notice in the afternoon, got into his packed, small car, and after that I never heard from him again.“Naturally there is a good deal of speculation about whether the police want to dig here like they have been doing in Hanover.”German TV channel RTL reports that television teams and photographers from the UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands “among others” flocked to Hanover to cover the search for clues in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.But, the station added, not much is known as yet about the three-day probe of an abandoned allotment.The public prosecutors office in Braunschweig has not updated reporters on what –anything – has been found during the forensic investigation.Skys crime correspondent Martin Brunt described the search,  years after Madeleines abduction, a “dramatic development”.Locals are urging police to come and investigate ANOTHER allotment on a plot that was also rented by Christian B. The -year-old child sex fiend, who is the prime suspect in the search for Madeleine McCann, lived at the isolated garden house for three years after quitting the kiosk he ran.Locals are now urging police to come and dig at the site after they uncovered a cellar at his other garden in Hanover last night, some  miles away.The single storey building is at the end of a track close to a railway line in Braunschweig.Christian B lived on site there between  and  and was often seen with girlfriend Nakscije Mtari.He occupied the land at the same time when five-year-old Inga Gehricke, dubbed the ‘German Maddie’, vanished from a nearby forest during a family barbecue.The site is rumoured to have a cellar beneath it # just like the one dramatically discovered in Hanover yesterday.The Sun uncovered what appears to be a boarded up well at the property this morning. German police who searched a garden on the outskirts of Hannover, northern Germany, used excavators, snfer dogs, shovels and rakes to investigate the plot.Investigators put up two tents and continued to dig even further into the ground after they had cut down trees and bushes earlier this week, the German news agency dpa reported.Prosecutors did not say what the investigators were looking for.At the garden plot, investigators even removed parts of the foundation of a former cabin from the ground that once stood there, dpa reported.A man on a neighbouring plot told the news agency that the garden, where blackberry bushes and a cheery tree grow, had not been used for the last two years.The site was previously home to a German suspect linked to Madeleines disappearance.A hidden cellar that was discovered during a search for clues in relation to missing Madeleine McCann has been completely filled in with sand.Updated site pics show the garden has been cleared of vegetation, and covered in sand.The abandoned German allotment has this week been the scene of an intense search by about  cops and forensic experts, which started on Monday night and has now ended.A picture taken on July  shows a sign on one tree reading “No entry to the property. Parents are liable for their children” after the police finished a three-day search in the northern German city of Hanover.Cops in Germany could swoop on a second allotment plot rented by twisted Christian B after the new owner admitted: “I’m worried I’m sleeping over a dead body.”Neighbours said the woman who now owns the plot, Sabine Sellig, recently urged police to come and dig her land.Her friend Thomas Tager told The Sun: “She is terried.“She has begged police to come with search dogs. She said to me ‘I’m worried I am sleeping on a dead body’.”Potential sightings of the British three-year old followed up by British cops total , across  countries and territories, a Freedom of Information request by The Sun showed in October .A list of sightings from each of the  countries # nearly all of which have been labelled NFA or No Further Action.Most serious were the alleged sightings in the hours and days following Madeleines disappearance.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Teenagers, it turns out, are a bit of an ordeal.Studies show that mums and dads of teens are  per cent more stressed than  years ago.There’s not just the financial pressures from teens, the constant keepie-uppie with phones, computers and fashion, but the added pleasure of social media.Then throw into the mix hormones, curfews, risky behaviours, smoking, drinking and sex and you have a ­wonderful pottage of purgatory.When your children reach their teens they need to question your authority in order to find the impetus to break away and become independent adults. And they don’t do this lightly. No, they make sure they also judge and question your parenting and basically suck the le out of you.For most of us women it also often coincides with the menopause and ­possibly mid-le crises. I mean, could there be a more perfect storm  Unsurprisingly, girls are more antagonistic towards the female parent. And research shows the task of setting limits for their teenagers falls more to mothers than it does to fathers.I have four childrenand they are all very dferent. One no longer lives at home. He’s  and is my Goldenballs, as his teenage years really lulled me into a  sense of security, being largely painless.I also have two girls, aged  and , plus a boy of . So far . . . and I do love you, girls, BUT . . . the boys are proving simpler, less complicated. Unconscious bias, possibly.Lockdown with these hoodlums forced me to question my sanity, made me feel like I was in freefall and wonder what the hell I had been thinking all those times in the past when my ­Fallopian tubes would jump for joy as soon as I saw a man.I’m a liberal parent. I haven’t sought to make my children my “friends” but I ­certainly wasn’t prepared for the ­contempt, defiance, audacity and ­confrontation that has arrived. About everything, from changing the toilet rollto rudeness , politenessand lack of empathy . I’m not allowed to utter the words, “Well, when I was a teenager”, because allegedly I’ve never been one.I can’t offer advice because I “don’t understand”. I’m not allowed to discipline because that’s “damaging”.I’ve been reprimanded for calling one of the Ungratefuls “lazy”. In modern times, this is “injurious and prejudicial”, I was told. Yes, she used those words. I did once try to explain that she’s intelligent and could go far. “Intelligent” is also detrimental to her mental wellbeing, I was informed.Give me strength.At the beginning of lockdown, I would cry out loud and scream from time to time — just to let off steam because I felt utterly trapped.And because I was parenting on my own, I guess there is no need for orce or separation or marriage breakdown now.But I felt utterly blindsided by the scale of the task because teens nowadays are savvy buggers who are well versed in conversations about ious “conditions” everyone seems to be struggling with — mental health, eating disorders, anxiety.Which is great. But not so great when you’re trying to run through a minefield to get to the other side before they ­criticise your parenting abilities and make you feel like a complete sham.Things have improved slightly. It was that or murder. But it has sapped me of all my energy and made me question what I was thinking when I thought that having kids was a great idea.I joke, of course. They can bring me enormous pleasure when they actually do change the toilet roll. Butyou think weaning and sleep-training is tough, wait until you join the Bewildered Mum Of Teens Club.A very close friend of mine always used to say: “Small children, small problems. Big children, big problems.” So enjoy your little eight-pounder while you can.I exaggerate not when I say I’m sometimes scared to open my mouth at home because one of the Ungratefuls has been a ­passionate advocate of social justice since she first strung a sentence together. Often, I am jokingly and harmlessly inappropriate and un-PC, only succeeding in pushing my middle-age boundaries in a woke world of righteous fundamentalists. But it was when my -year-old Ungrateful sat at the table with a look of absolute panic on his face that I realised things have gone too far. All he had asked his ­sister was: “Can you pass the black pepper  Or is that racist ”I WAS disturbed to learn that the puppy Katie Price bought for her -year-old daughter Princess died in an accident at home. There’s more than one lesson there for a young girl, I would have thought.I was equally disturbed to learn there has been an increase in people buying puppies during lockdown – because apparently, what  is there to do  Except puppies require a lot of work and attention, demand constant ­surveillance and are sentient beings with needs that require a long-term emotional and financial commitment.I worry about how many of these pets will be surrendered or neglected once “normal le” resumes.And why people won’t consider ­adopting rescue dogs when shelters and rescue centres are brimming with ownerless animals.A dog is for le. Not just for lockdown.LOVELY newsreader George Alagiah said that when he first came to England from Ghana at the age of  and headed to boarding school, he made damn sure he had a cut-glass English accent in order to avoid racist and classist bullies.As a foreigner who arrived from Sweden at the same age, I had the same ambition – I wanted to sound like the locals and did not want to stand out.I became all the more determined after slipping up when getting “soup” and “soap” confused, mistaking a sofa “suite” for a sofa “suit” and always referring to spiders’ “cod webs”.It burned like hell to be laughed at because you couldn’t speak properly.Now, I’m pleased to say, my grammar and English is often better than my peers’ because I had to learn everything from scratch and I didn’t want to attract attention.Until I decided on a job in TV, that is.HANDSOME Viking eye-candy Dolph Lundgren has just got engaged.

Yet a handsome man marrying an adolescent girl is much more palatable.Well, I’m not having it. Don’t you dare give me the side eye when I walk with my future -year-old beau! OK, a girl’s gotta dream.A ROBUST, toned, muscled, strapping, athletic, sturdy, brawny, vigorous, rippedman has been parading up and down Oxford Street in London in his birthday suit with his plumbing shielded only by a feeble face mask.

And it takes your breath away.SWEDEN didn’t go into lockdown, preferring instead to keep the economy going with its obedient citizens.The Swedes have been pleased by the way their government have tackled the pandemic, so much so that a solid minority has decided to get tattoos of the chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell.

But given how contagious this virus is and how much it spreads around the world I think anything that can protect you from the disease, from becoming sick, from going into hospital, I think will be a big step forward for the world.”The company is rapidly working towards getting the jab approved by October.Based on tests, Sir Pangalos said the most effective way to get the right dose to build up an immune response appears to be getting two shots weeks apart.The immune-response in over-s is still unclear, and it remains unknown whether the vaccine could be administered to children and provide lelong protection, like the measles vaccination.In addition to the  million doses of a vaccine being developed by Oxford University, the Government has also secured early access to  million doses from GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi Pasteur.If the vaccine candidate is proven effective in human studies, the UK could be able to vaccinate priority groups - such as frontline health and social care workers and the vulnerable - as soon as the first half of .Human clinical studies of the vaccine will begin in September followed by a Phase  study in December .The Government has now secured early access to four dferent types of immunisation and a total of  million doses.Matt Hancock has previously said the best-case scenario is for a vaccine to be available this year.But the Health Secretary added it will more likely be ready in .Kate Bingham, chair of the governments vaccines taskforce, said: Through this agreement with GSK and Sanofi, we can add another type of vaccine to the three dferent types of vaccine we have already secured.This ersity of vaccine types is important because we do not yet know which,any, of the dferent types of vaccine will prove to generate a safe and protective response to Covid-. Whilst this agreement is very good news, we mustnt be complacent or over optimistic.The fact remains we may never get a vaccine andwe do get one, we have to be prepared that it may not be a vaccine which prevents getting the virus, but rather one that reduces symptoms.Last week the UK secured  million doses of a potential vaccine to make sure Brits are first in line for a jab.That deal is being developed by an alliance between BioNtech and Pfizer as well as the firm Valneva.It comes as Boris Johnson warned there are signs of a second wave sweeping Europe.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From the start, Kate was horried at the way Meghan spoke to staff members at Kensington Palace and it was clear they would never click in the way Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson had once done.The now infamous tiara row, which I first revealed in November , was the culmination of many fallouts before the wedding.Afterwards, William and the Queen’s dresser and closest confidante, Angela Kelly, were united in their decision not to loan Meghan items from the Royal Collection, which included tiaras worn by Diana.As I began to report these stories, it is true to say Harry and Meghan became suspicious of their own staff, incorrectly believing they had been somehow hijacked by dark forces, the so-called “men in grey suits”, at Buckingham Palace.That categorisation is too simplistic.Who are these men  They may have existed in , but the senior figures in key roles behind the scenes within the Royal Family tend to be thoroughly modern members of the metropolitan elite these days.While it is correct to say they encouraged the couple to follow more conventional processes in terms of their dealings with other royal households and the Press, the real-le Sussex Squad was doggedly committed to the couple’s principles and goals.For example, their communications chief Sara Latham — blamed by Meghan for any negative stories in British newspapers — was a highly successful opera- tor who had worked for Hillary Clinton.She was prepared to pack up her le in London and move to Africa with the couple perman- ently to help achieve their humanitarian goals.Much official time and energy was put into the South African relocation planonly for the couple to eventually brand it too dficult.Instead, Harry and Meghan foolishly began to rely almost entirely on advice provided by a small team of fiercely loyal Hollywood advisers.I managed to unpick details of this secret cabal throughout the latter half of last year, but they had been causing major headaches for Buckingham Palace long before that.The group — attorney Rick Genow, business manager Andrew Meyer and talent agent Nick Collins — are typical Hollywood “Yes” people.Just as important were her PR advisers from the controversial crisis management firm Sunshine Sachs, specically Shawn Sachs and Keleigh Thomas Morgan.They had all become close with Meghan while she was a moderate star on the cable TV legal drama Suits, an era when she was so desperate for coverage in magazines she would even set up shots with paparazzi photog- raphers.She kept the Hollywood crew largely on the sidelines during the early days of her courtship with Harry. But as tensions with royal courtiers increased, so too did Meghan’s contact with them.It was this team who bunkered down with Meghan over Christmas and New Year in Canada, secretly drafting the content for the Sussex Royal website that, when published,like a Hollywood press release than a statement of intent by two senior members of the British Royal Family.Much has been written about how I broke the story of Megxit, with the finger incorrectly being pointed at both Clarence House and Kensington Palace.The couple like to promote the idea that they were somehow ambushed into revealing their plans after we published the world exclusive on January .However, they neglect to mention I had originally put the story to their office ten days earlier and had discussed every aspect of what we eventually published with their officials.It is not a coincidence my first story of the move included details of the Sussexes’ unhappiness about the release of photographs over Christmas featuring the Queen, Charles, William and George.The biography goes further by pointing to the absence of a picture of Harry, Meghan and Archie on the Queen’s table during her annual Christmas Day message.It is inconceivable to me that this wasn’t a purposeful slight by the institution, trying to make a point to Harry and Meghan: “Come back and join the party during events like Christmas or we’ll pretend you don’t exist.”It backfired spectacularly.So can such a toxic relationship be healed There is a growing acknowledgement from both sides that so long as Harry and Meghan’s romantic relationship remains strong, that is highly unlikely.But this book is a spectacular own goal by a couple who like to insist they are opposed to bitchy off-the-record briefings and royal revelations using source quotes slagging off other members of The Firm.Because fundamentally, that’s all Finding Freedom is.Unlike Andrew Morton’s game-changing Diana: Her True Story, there is no revelation that makes you think dferently about what went on.A couple desperate to blame others for their unwise decisions have allowed a fanboy “journalist” to confirm a whole load of newspaper exclusives, which they incidentally denied at the time, but spun with their own, often , narrative.Harry and Meghan are not victims of the media, the establishment or the British public.I will never forget that beautul spring day in May  when the entire country celebrated a royal wedding with the type of hope and joy not seen since July , when Charles and Diana tied the knot.It was one of those rare moments, like the London  Olympics, when we celebrated as one.This couple had the world at their feet — superstardom and influence any film actor or pop star would dream of, but without the cumbersome pressure of the throne hanging over them, like the Cambridges.They had a very real chance to help reinvent and modernise the monarchy from within.What a tragedy they have chosen to focus their energies on settling scores in tawdry tell-alls and unnecessary courtroom battles.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I don’t know how much he’d be able to help you with, but seeing as he’s in a lot of trouble himself these days I think he might, so I think he might be valuable.Roberts, now , claims that she was forced to have sex with Epstein who also made her have sex with a number of his associates.Epstein instructed Jane Doe to give Prince Andrew whatever he demanded and required her to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse, the lawyers said. Maxwell facilitated Epstein’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a madam.Roberts also revealed the infamous photo of the royal with his arm around her waist was taken by Epstein on her Kodak camera.She added she passed the picture to the FBI during their investigations in .Similar allegations against Andrew were ordered by a federal judge to be struck from court records in  after being lodged as part of a lawsuit involving Epstein — but the judge did not rule on the veracity of the claims.Some of Andrews supporters have long maintained that the royal had done nothing wrong, and pointed out that just because allegations are including in court papers it does not mean they are true.US Attorney General Bill Barr said earlier this year that Andrew must speak to the FBI and his team definitely want to interview him.He said: The department wants to talk to Prince Andrew. Thats why the Southern District has been making efforts to communicate with him. Weve made it clear that wed like to communicate with him.However, sources close to the Duke of Yorks legal team say they have contacted Department of Justice representatives in the US on a number of occasions since they were first contacted at the beginning of the year.The case is separate from the current criminal proceedings against Maxwell, , who is accused of procuring girls as young as  for Epstein to abuse.The British socialite has pleaded not guilty and is due to stand trial next July.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The R rate has become an essential way of the government measuring its success in dealing with coronavirus in the UK.It measures the rate of infection that averages how many people are being infected by one person, with officials using this data to guide the UK out of lockdown.Scientists use it to predict how far and how fast a disease will spread - and the number can also inform policy decisions about how to contain an outbreak.For example,a virus has an R of three, it means that every sick person will pass the disease on to three other peopleno containment measures are introduced.Its also worth pointing out that the R is a measure of how infectious a disease is, but not how deadlyThe R rate indicates how fast coronavirus is likely to spread, and it ies across the UK.Speaking at a press conference this afternoon Mr Johnson said he would not let the virus threaten more heartache across the country.He today announced that some businesses that were set to open tomorrow will no longer be able to open their doors.Place such as casinos and bowling alleys will no longer be able to reopen and this guidance will be updated in two weeks.The Prime Minister also said that he wasnt willing to take the risk when it comes to wedding restrictions.Wedding receptions of up to  people will not be permitted, but ceremonies can go ahead with the Covid guidlines, he said.He did however say that shielding rules will still be relaxed from tomorrow, allowing more vulnerable people to get back to normal le.Mr Johnson said the government would study the data and would re-open when we can.However chief medical officer Chris Whitty said we are likely to be at the limit of what we can do when it comes to opening up society once more.Dr Daniel Lawson, Lecturer in Statistical Science, School of Mathematics, University of Bristol said the data from the ONS provides some data of an increase.When cases are low, the average reproduction rate can still be below  but we can see an increase in cases by chance, because cases tend to occur in bursts within a community, which should be capturedtest and trace systems are working.  We can also see an increase in cases by changes in testing or reporting.“Decisions must be made in the face of this uncertainty, such as the announcement that the UK is pausing easing.He added that evidence from Europe implies that we should take the apparent increase seriously, as acting too late can make lockdowns longer and increase mortality.Dr Lawson added that the UK is close to the tipping point and said we should prepare for further rapid action.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My name is on the show and everything we do and I take responsibility for that. Alongside Warner Bros., we immediately began an internal investigation and we are taking steps, together, to correct the issues. As we’ve grown exponentially, I’ve not been able to stay on top of everything and relied on others to do their jobs as they knew I’d want them done. Clearly some didn’t. That will now change and I’m committed to ensuring this does not happen again,” she continued.There are rumors that Ed Glavin, an executive producer, is about to be fired as a result of an internal investigation into complaints of a toxic work environment at the show, according to The Hollywood Reporter.Glavin was part of a trio of senior producers closest to Ellen, which included Andy Lassner and Mary Connelly. Glavin is allegedly set to exit his role in the near future.People have also accused executive producer Kevin Leman for behaving inappropriately at a company party in  and in May .An internal investigation by parent company WarnerMedia is allegedly taking place after employees came forward about experiencing racism, fear, and intimidation” while working on the talk show.Telepictures - which produces the daytime series - and Warner Bros. - which is in charge of distribution - sent an e-mail to staffers last week to say they’re working with a third party firm, according to Variety.Sources told the outlet in addition to the third party company, WarnerMedia’s employee relations group will also interview current and former workers about their experiences on set.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It needs fixing.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

However, in its current form it fails to provide a dependable safety net. It has led to an unprecedented number of people relying on foodbanks and not being able to pay their rent.He said some features of the system were harming women, disabled people and the vulnerable.And he added: “Universal Credit needs more money to catch up after  years of cuts to the social security budget and substantial reform to its design.“The five-week wait for a first payment must be replaced by a non-repayable two-week grant to all claimants.The Lords report also recommends that the punitive taper rate should be reduced - another aim of The Suns campaign - to encourage more people into work.And it says all claimants should have a higher work allowance to allow them to keep more of their hard-earned cash too.The Lords also conclude that including childcare support in Universal Credit was a mistake and paying in arrears is a huge barrier to work - as we have repeatedly highlighted.In some cases it has been a disincentive to work, the report says.The Government should remove childcare support from Universal Credit and be made into a new standalone benefit paid, it added.Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labours Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said of the report: “Sadly, this report confirms what many have known for a long time – Universal Credit is simply not working. There is clear consensus that the system is not delivering on its objectives and is instead pushing people further into poverty and debt.Ministers should listen to their Conservative colleagues’ calls for a reformed social security system.The DWP said in response to the report it would consider their recommendations in detail.Minister for Welfare Delivery Will Quince said of the report: “The case for Universal Credit has never been stronger. The system defied its critics in unprecedented and unforeseeable circumstances, processing more than .m new claims at pace since mid-March and paying more than a million advances worth hundreds of millions of pounds to those in urgent need within days.“We remain committed to supporting the most vulnerable in society, which is why we currently spend over £ billion a year on the benefits system. We’ve also increased the Universal Credit standard allowance by up to £, a year, as part of a package of welfare measures worth over £. billion.“We welcome the acknowledgement by the Committee that Universal Credit is here to stay and we will consider their recommendations in detail.”IF youre experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover costs, here are your options:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

People in the whole of Greater Manchester may no longer meet anyone from outside their household indoors - including homes, pubs and gardens. The affected area also includes parts of West Yorkshire and Lancashire. However, people are allowed to continue to meet outdoors as long as they stay socially distanced. They can still go to work, travel, and go to the pub - though only with their own household. With the laws now dfering across England and the short notice, many people in Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire are confused about what they can and canapost do. Hereaposs the best explanation we can provide of what laws apply, where. Where the law will apply Greater Manchester:City of Manchester Trafford Stockport Oldham Bury Wigan Bolton Tameside Rochdale SalfordLancashire:Blackburn with Darwen Burnley Hyndburn Pendle RossendaleWest Yorkshire:Bradford Calderdale Kirklees What you can be fined for - and how much New laws will be passed to ban meeting people from other households in private homes or gardens. Police will be able to fine offenders £ for a first offence, doubling on each subsequent offence. Under previous similar laws the maximum fine was £,. Fines halvepaid within  days. There will be some exceptions, such as for household bubbles . Other rules - like not visiting care homes, not socialising with people in pubs, and not sharing cars - look set to be guidance rather than the law. However, there is already a nationwide legal ban on gatherings over  people outdoors and people must legally wear a face covering in shops and on public transport. We donapost yet know when the law will be published or take effect.What you canapost do You canapost meet up with friends or family indoors If you live in the above areas, you may no longer meet anyone from outside your household indoors. aposIndoorsapos includes private homes, businesses like pubs and restaurants, and private gardens . The exception is for people who are part of the same aposbubbleapos - more on this below. When it comes to private homes and gardens, this rule will be enforced by law with fines of £. In the rest of England, there is no longer a law on meeting people from other households indoors. However, guidance says meetings should comprise no than two households, and be socially distanced.   You canapost go to the pub with anyone outside your own household If you live in the above areas, you may still go to pubs, restaurants, bars and other venues that reopened from July . However, you may only go with members of your own household. You must not socialise with people you do not live with in other indoor public venues. You canapost go to a pub beer garden with anyone outside your own household Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the ban on socialising in indoor public venues will include pub beer gardens. This means you cannot go to the pub socially with anyone from outside your household - whether youaposre indoors or outdoors.  You canapost meet friends and family in their garden The ban on meeting other households in indoor spaces includes private gardens - even though theyaposre outdoors. This is because to get there, you often have to pass through the house. You canapost have visitors to your home from outside the new lockdown area You may not have visitors to your home from outside the new lockdown area. This will be illegal. But you can meet them in a pubic area like a parkyou follow social distancing rules.  You canapost visit relatives in care homes Last week the government announced care home visits in England could finally resume.  But in the new lockdown areas, care home visits will not resume. Guidance for them says: You should not visit friends or family in care homes, other than in exceptional circumstances. Care homes should restrict visits to these circumstances. You canapost travel in a car with people outside your household The guidance for the new lockdown area says: You should try not to share a vehicle with those outside your household or social bubble. If you need to, try to share the vehicle with the same people each time, keep to small groups and open windows for ventilation. You should also sit as far apart as possible within the vehicle, wear face coverings and clean the inside thoroughly and regularly. You shouldnapost travel to the lockdown area from Scotland The Scottish government issued new guidance today advising people living in Scotland not to travel to the new lockdown areas at all. The guidance says: Travel between Scotland and Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire should only be undertakenabsolutely essential. Anyone currently in the affected areas does not need toto Scotland early - but should be extra vigilant in monitoring for symptoms.What you can do You can meet up with friends or family outdoors People in the new lockdown area can continue to meet people outside their household in outdoor spaces - like a park, forest or the beach. This is still in line with guidance for the rest of England. The law only restricts gatherings of more than  people. However, guidance says you should only meet in groups of up to two households, or six people - whichever is larger. Each household should remain socially distant from each other.  You can meet people in your aposbubbleapos indoors Since June , people in England have been able to form a support bubble with one other household. To qualy, one of the two households has to have only one adult in it. For example, a single mum or a granddad living alone. If youaposre in a bubble, you can continue this even in the new lockdown areas like Greater Manchester. You should basically treat your two-household bubble asit is one household. You can stop shielding from tomorrow Most of the .million aposextremely clinically vulnerableapos people in England can stop shielding tomorrow. This means they can be asked toto work, and follow the same social distancing rules as the rest of the populationthey wish. This is unchanged in most of the new lockdown area. People in Greater Manchester, for example, can still stop shielding tomorrow. Exceptions are Luton and Blackburn with Darwen, where shielding should continue to August . In Leicester shielding also continues until at least August  and could run in some parts of the city beyond that.  You can go to work and use public transportneeded People living inside and outside of the new area can continue to travel in and out for work Workplaces must implement Covid- Secure guidance. Public transport will continue running for those who need it, with face coverings worn by all. You can travel in and out of the area You may continue to travel in and out of the new lockdown area, as long as you do not break the rules on meetings indoors. People from outside can take holidays in the new lockdown area,they follow the local rules. People who live inside the new area should continue to follow the ban on meeting other households indoors, eventheyaposre outside the zone at the time.  You can go to cafes, restaurants, the gym and other venues - but only with members of your own household All the venues that reopened on July  remain open, with a few exceptions in local areas where there is an outbreak. But you should only go with members of your own household – evenyou are going outside of the restricted area. You can go to a place of worship You can go to a place of worship, but you must socially distance from people outside of your household. The place of worship should also be following Covid-secure guidelines to keep people apart. Officials recommend at this time that,possible, prayer or religious services take place outdoors. This includes mosques, which are celebrating Eid. "},{"url":null,"title":"dont blame muslims matt hancock","story":"NewsopinionDont blame the Muslims, Matt Hancock.

Itaposs natural that people want to shoot the messenger, butyou donapost read the column, donapost like the column you read, or donapost understand the words in it, then you leave me no choice. I shall just have to communicate with you more clearly.And Matt Hancock agrees. He is, as he felt necessary to point out to Radio  listeners this morning, the Health Secretary in the middle of a global pandemic, so you will excuse me for being concerned about the health of the British public. Yeah. Itaposs the other stuff thereaposs no excuse for, Matthew.Announcing a local lockdown,  hours before it began, for .m people on a social media site whose users are % affluent millennials, Mr Hancock said: The spread is largely due to households meeting and not abiding to social distancing.Except the government messaging on social distancing is so chaotic that % of Brits have no idea what the rules are any more.When was the last time you heard a government minister remind you to wash your hands  Itaposs been weeks*. Compare that, class, to the last time you heard a government minister say that masks were not really necessary. You may find that one has been signicantly more recent, and effective, than the other. The people of Rochdale, Leicester, Blackburn, Burnley, Calderdale, Rossendale, Kirklees, Bradford, Hyndburn, Pendle, and Greater Manchester are more likely to be meeting up with others in non-socially distant situations because thataposs the nature of the jobs they are more likely to do, and Boris Johnson ordered them all back to work a fortnight ago. Those areas have lower wages, higher occupancy housing, and more manufacturing. More towns, and fewer villages. None of those things are consistent with staying metres apart, and a month ago the government told them not to bother so much with that, anyway.The people who live there are also more likely to have health conditions which make them more susceptible, and the government told them to stop shielding yesterday . Worldwide, the two factors consistently linked to lower coronavirus rates are early lockdowns and comprehensive testing.We locked down late, as even the Prime Minister grudgingly half-agrees, and our world-beating test and trace system is about the worldaposs worst. Of the .m coronavirus home testing kits sent through the post, only m have been processed. These privately-provided, non-NHS tests are complex, unpleasant, must be collected quickly to be viable, and some people report them being damaged or dropped in a puddle by the courier. Eventhey are sent back, the chances of a  negative are somewhere between  in  and  in . Either way, .m people who should have been tested werenapost. And a fortnight ago, Hancock announced an urgent review of... the way deaths are counted, which may be a few hundred out and therefore making the government look so much worse than it really is. Caposmere, thereaposs more! In June it was revealed that outsourced, inexperienced, Serco tracers contacted an average of . people each. Trained Public Health England officials found  people each. The multi-million-pound private contracts which lost .m tests and needed  members of staff to trace  human were in the gt of, under the oversight of, and signed off by, Matt Hancock.And just yesterday he told the Royal College of Physicians that in future the health service must draw on the ideas and expertise of the private sector because people donapost care who has provided the test. They care itaposs not you, Matt.And he added that bureaucracy - translation: public servants whoaposve done a better job than him thus far - must be cut. There are no ideologues in a pandemic, he trilled, despite the fact he has stuck to the ideology of a competitive, open market in healthcare through the piling-up of, to date, , corpses.  The government guidance, issued overnight on the same fag packet that contains all the previous guidance, says people can go to restaurants with members of their own households, but not pubsthereaposs a stranger there.They can leave the restricted area to go to work, but people from outside the restricted area cannot come to visit. They cannot meet people in gardens, but they can meet in parks. They should use public transport, and must use masks, but no-one will tell them offthey donapost. Oh, and it also claims West Yorkshire is now in the North West. See, Matt, this is why no-one listens to you. You couldnapost find your arse with a map, because you canapost read a map. But itaposs not Mattaposs fault. No. Itaposs the Spanish, whose infection rate is still lower than ours, or the second wave that is not sweeping Europe. For preference, though, itaposs the disease-ridden Muslims the finger is pointed at. So letaposs pepper the order to lockdown with references to the Islamic festival of Eid-al-Adha, which canapost be blamed for any of this because it only started yesterday.Matt does hope you have a nice time, butall those wonderfully-erse, one-quarter ethnic minority places could stay at home, go to work, sit in a park, go to the pub, go to mosque, and take the blame for the omnicrapshambles heaposs made of everything, that would be wonderful.Because letaposs be perfectly clear. The infection rate has tripled in the past week in Oxford, the High Peak, and Watford, doubled in Brighton and Tunbridge Wells, increased by a factor of  in the Ribble Valley and Bolsover, and no-one is telling the residents of those places to behave themselves better. Because in Oxford, the worst of these listed, coronavirus is in just .% of the population.Meanwhile, the infection rate in Blackburn with Darwen which is the worst district in the country, is .%. Last week, when lockdown wasnapost necessary, it was .%.We just canapost ignore this evidence, say Matt and his mates, who have all happily ignored calls for an inquiry into why people from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities are more likely to catch and die from coronavirus.They also ignore the fact the infection rate in care homes a couple of months ago was %, that they didnapost find it necessary to do much about it, and those same care homes have just been told thereaposll be no more tests for  weeks.Theyaposd much rather you think corona is on the march, and thataposs thanks to the poor, brown people who wonapost stay indoors and definitely not down to the rich, white people who wonapost shut up. Theyaposd like to terry everyone about a surge for which there is, at present, no clear or consistent evidence. Because the only time this government scored good approval ratings was back in early April, when we were all scared and Dominic Cummingsapos eyesight was of no concern.

The government has confirmed that new rules, banning indoor meetings between households in Greater Manchester and parts of East Lancashire and West Yorkshire, will also apply to bars and restaurants. That means people in those areas cannot meet members of other households in a pub or restaurant. But people can still go to the pub with members of their own household - as long as they stay as one group and donapost socialise with anyone . Gardens are also understood to be off-limits - but you can meet people from other households in parks and outdoor spaces. Confusion abounded on Thursday after Matt Hancock announced a ban on indoor meetings for large parts of the north of England. New measures - affecting millions of people - were due to come into force at midnight. However no guidance had been published and officials appeared to be in the dark on the details of the plans. Furious MPs demanded answers from the Government about the move. Labour leader Keir Starmer said: No one would argue with putting in place local action to reduce the transmission of coronavirus. But announcing measures affecting potentially millions of people late at night on Twitter is a new low for the government’s communications during this crisis. He said the public needed greater clarity from ministers over such signicant changes.  Shadow Cabinet Minister Jonathan Reynolds, who represents Stalybridge and Hyde in Greater Manchester, said: I have to say a few tweets from a Minister late at night is not the way to announce something as signicant as this. Mr Hancock announced the move at .pm, saying households gathering and not abiding by the social-distancing rules was a reason for the stricter rules and it was in order to keep the country safe. He said: We take this action with a heavy heart but unfortunately itaposs necessary because weaposve seen that households meeting up and a lack of social distancing is one of the causes of this rising rate of coronavirus and weaposll do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe.

Shortly after pm on Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that from midnight, people from dferent households in Greater Manchester, parts of Lancashire and parts of Yorkshire were no longer allowed to meet indoors. It means people in these areas will not be permitted to mix with other households - apart from those in their support bubbles - in private homes or gardens. Some exemptions will be put in place, including for the vulnerable, the government said. They will sign new regulations to make these changes legally enforceable. The regulations will give local authorities and police forces the powers to enforce these restrictions. Households may go to hospitality, for instance bars and pubs, but new guidance will make clear that two households should not go to hospitality together. Meanwhile local leaders and government have today agreed a number of changes to local restrictions in other areas. Below are the areas affected by the new restriction... Greater Manchester The rules apply to the whole of Greater Manchester after a number of hotspots were identied. Oldham, Trafford and Manchester were all in the  places with the highest Covid- infection rates. Figures released yesterday showed Oldham had overtaken Leicester, with . cases per , of the population. It was followed by Trafford, with . and Manchester with ..  Parts of East Lancashire It is no secret that Blackburn with Darwen has been cause for concern for some time, with the highest infection rate in England. Yesterday it had . cases per , of the population, and the council had issued fresh guidelines, including a limit on the number of visitors allowed into homes. The new measures go further, however, banning members of two households meeting indoors. Other affected areas are Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle, Rossendale.  Parts of West Yorkshire Three West Yorkshire towns and cities feature in the  worst affected places in England - Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees. Public Health England yesterday said there were . cases per , in the population in Bradford, making it the fourth worst affected area. It was followed by Calderdale in eighth place and Kirklees in tenth. They had rates of . and . per , respectively.  What is happening in Leicester  While social gathering restrictions remain in place in Leicester City, the area will benefit from the lting of restrictions that took place on  July in England, and all local restrictions currently in place in the neighbouring borough of Oadby and Wigston will end. It means from Monday  August restaurants, cafes, bars and hairdressers in Leicester City can get back to business but leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed.  In addition, cinemas and museums will open and religious ceremonies will be able to take place. And on Saturday  August, Luton will be brought in line with the rest of the country after signicant progress has been made in controlling the virus.

In their  manesto the Conservatives pledged that free TV licences for the over s would be retained. But on Saturday this much-loved benefit comes to an end. The Tories are trying to pin the blame on the BBC but the responsibility lies entirely with them. They made a promise and now they are refusing to abide by their word. No wonder so many people feel betrayed. Free TV licences are not a perk. They are a leline for millions of pensioners for whom the telly is a source of companionship and a window into the outside world. The decision is especially cruel when so many older people are having to shield because of coronavirus. A government with a conscience would find the money to enable the BBC to maintain the benefit. In failing to do so this Tory administration has shown it is shameless and heartless. Utter failure Boris Johnson is kidding nobody when he claims his handling of the coronavirus outbreak has been a ‘massive success’. The figures from the Office for National Statistics tell the real story – England has the highest number of excess deaths in Europe. An estimated , residents have died in care homes after patients were discharged from hospital without being tested.

And she was sacked when bosses found out - bringing to a sudden end a -year career with the same company.Megan Metcalfe told NottinghamshireLive that she was given her marching orders as her actions were deemed to amount to gross misconduct. Popular Birds Bakery has not been accepting cash for hygiene reasons since reopening following the coronavirus lockdown.They say it is to minimise any risk to staff and customers.  Yesterday, we reported how a -year-old customer was shocked and embarrassed when a Birds branch refused to sell her bread because she only had cash.And today Megan told of how many of the customers at the Birds store where she worked, in Radclfe-on-Trent, are elderly and donapost have a debit card. To make sure they didnapost leave empty-handed, the -year-old of Ruddington decided to ask them to put the money straight into her purse. She would then put the payment through on her card before showing them the receipt. The bakery business said it was with regret that they had to dismiss Megan because of her actions. I realise what I was doing was against company policy. But they had picked up the items and already gotten to the till ready to buy them, Megan said. Thereaposs no way I could let an elderly man or woman walk away telling them they could not buy it because they didnapost have a card. They had also already handled the stock so that would have to be binned or cleaned. Megan says she took around £ of payments in cash and put them through on her card and has kept receipts of the transactions.  She said she was suspended from work for a week with full pay on June  and appeared before a disciplinary hearing the week after before being dismissed from the company. I was just trying to do the right thing. I am really upset by it of course, she added. I worked at Birds for  years and  of them as a manager. I was told I was endangering staff membersapos lives by doing what I did. At no point did money transfer hands. It was straight into my purse and then I put the payment through on card and showed them the receipt. I should not have done it but I donapost like to let people down and a lot of these customers depend on us, coming to us every day. Lesley Bird, chief operating officer at Birds Bakery, said: “At Birds, we take the safety of our staff and customers very seriously – and have very tight procedures in place during this pandemic. A lot of our customer base are the elderly – many of them vulnerable – and it is our responsibility to keep them, and our staff, safe.

Businesses in popular resorts slammed the Government’s “draconian” move, which came just weeks after Spain was put on the UK’s list of safe countries. At Malaga airport, the gateway to the Costa del Sol for millions of Brits each year, half-empty planes landed throughout the day from airports across the UK. Many of the passengers who did make the trip said they were only doing so as they had a business or holiday home in the area. One tourist from Belfast said their flight was “barely % full” while another said theirs was “virtually empty”. Barely any Brits could be seen entering through arrivals, though there was a steady stream from nations such as France, Germany and Holland. A Spanish tour rep said: “This should be full of British right now . It’s so sad.” At the taxi rank, one of the many waiting drivers said: “Everybody is very angry with the British Government, it was a stupid decision by them, not based on facts.” Up the coast on the Costa Blanca, hotels in Benidorm began to close including the four-star Rio Park Hotel. Usually packed at this time of year, with % of its customers British package holiday tourists, it began to close its doors just six days after reopening. About four in five hotels in the town’s Rincon de Loix area are closed. Mr Hancock denied he was stoking up panic after he warned there was a “real danger” of the UK being hit by a fresh spike in cases. He said: “I think you can see a second wave starting to roll across Europe. We’ve got to do everything we can to prevent it from reaching these shores and to tackle it.” Jet said it will evacuate Brits on holiday in Spain and the Balearic and Canary Islands “up to and including August ”. Holidaymakers were told to cut short their holidays and book alternative flights. A spokeswoman said: “We apologise for any inconvenience caused.” Tonight it was announced that people ing from Luxembourg will have to quarantine for  days after a rise in cases there. It came amid speculation that other European countries including Belgium could be added to the list today. Spain’s tourism sector could take £billion hit this summer as the fresh restrictions take another chunk out of balance sheets already battered after months of lockdown. Bosses are hoping an upcoming review of the quarantine order could lt the restriction within days. Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto said: “They have given us a period of  days for the review.” She insisted resorts popular with Brits are “at low risk” of coronavirus and even “better” than the UK. Spain is still fighting for destinations such as the Canary and Balearic Islands to be excluded from the quarantine rule. Ms Maroto said: “There has been talk of a second wave of the pandemic but we’re not at all at that point. “The new outbreaks are under control and are in very specic places, and Spanish tourist destinations at the moment have very low levels of contagion. “That means people can enjoy their holidays there. The virus needs to be respected but that doesn’t mean we can’t have well-deserved holidays.” Spain announced , new cases on Wednesday, the highest -hour figure since May  when the entire country was still on full lockdown.

The -year-old, from Rochdale, is now dealing with people in Leicester who’ve tested positive for Covid-. A number of changes have been rolled out to the job in recent weeks - including a new measure to track down people who donapost answer calls from the team. Where contact tracers would have previously had four days to try and reach people, that’s been reduced in the outbreak groups.  Atexplains: “If after  hours we can’t make contact with them, we escalate it and a team will go to the household and conduct an interview instead of after  hours. That’s key,” he says. The new methods mean Ataposs vital job now involves so much more than just contact tracing. He went on: “When we call anyone from Leicester, we discuss with them in more detail support we can offer – such as help with food shopping and picking up prescription medication. ‘‘It’s hoped having people to do their essential shopping and pick up prescriptions will increase levels of compliance and make self-isolation easier.” Sarah Hartle , a dental hygienist from Manchester, is another NHS Test and Trace caseworker who has seen her job change to help fight coronavirus.  As pubs, restaurants and shops opened up, she and the team faced new challenges when tracing contacts, so they were given extra training to get the right information from people who’d tested positive for coronavirus. “What’s changed is the questions we’re asking the patients,” she says. “If they were in a shop, were they wearing a mask  Was the shopkeeper  Did they pay by cash or card  Were they maintaining social distancing  If you are doing all those things, the people in that particular shop are not classed as contacts. It’s all based on science. Social distancing does work.” And with the NHS Test and Trace team regularly updated on the latest advice and improvements in the system put in place, they’re able to give people the relevant help they need. She adds: “One recent patient needed a Hindi speaker. The system for that is now so simple and quick, the patient is only on hold for about  seconds and then youaposrere back with the interpreter.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dr miriam stoppard ethnic minorities","story":"NewsopinionDr Miriam Stoppard: Ethnic minorities being failed by lack of inclusive planningThe pandemic has starkly revealed that BAME people are less likely to use Covid- testing services – we need to look at issues from their point of view to find solutionsShareCommentsByMiriam Stoppard:,  JUL NewsopinionTesting kit instructions can be hard to understand for people whose first language is not English \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It’s not just in the UK that ­disparities exist – it’s worldwide. Action is needed to correct this so people from ethnic minorities are included in national and local health planning. Catherine Dodds of Bristol ­University and Ibidun Fakoya from King’s College, London suggest the way forward in an editorial in the BMJ. To keep the R number below one, governments are relying on ­nationwide testing and contact tracing until we have a vaccination programme in place. But while we wait, inequalities mean BAME Covid- infections and deaths keep rising.As Dodds and Fakoya point out we already know uptake of medical testing and screening is uneven across cancer risk assessment, antenatal screening, and HIV testing. The NHS is aiming to expand testing with self-administered swab kits – but this strategy may serve minority groups badly, bearing in mind a  UK study found uptake of HIV self-sampling kits among them was low compared with other groups. Most admitted they would probably not use the kits. Behind this reluctance were privacy issues and kits with complicated instructions that were inappropriately worded for people whose first language wasn’t English. Dodds and Fakoya emphasise until these faults are corrected it’s dficult to see how trust can be built up among our ethnic communities. Isn’t it time we looked at these ­disparities from the BAME point of view, and started framing instructions in a form that’s understandable, acceptable and useful for ethnic minorities instead of imposing a “one-size-fits-all” approach  Given the disproportionate and devastating impact this pandemic has already had among our ethnic minority communities, testing equality needs to be addressed in Covid- screening.

Emma Murby, , had split up with Timothy Green but he bombarded her with flowers, chocolates and sent her a new vacuum cleaner in a bid to win her back while she was in mourning. The teacher, who lives in the village of Eldwick, near Bingley, West Yorkshire, begged the -year-old company managing director to leave her alone - but he left her scores of messages, a Pandora ring and even posed as one of her friends to send her a condolence card. Police eventually the former golf club boss for harassment. At Stockport magistrates court, Green from Wilmslow, Cheshire who runs a company which provides safety inspections admitted harassment. He was banned from contacting Miss Murby for two years under the terms of a restraining order. The court heard the couple had met online in April  on POF and met in person for the first time at the end of that month. Prosecutor Mark Pritchard said: They then had a long-distance relationship where the defendant was living in Wilmslow and the complainant was living in Eldwick. They spent time together at weekends and sometimes met up in the week. At this point the complainant says it was a normal relationship and that she was happy. In August last year she moved in with him for a short period of time and their relationship became strained.  She moved back and after some time the relationship ended. That is when the defendant began his unrelenting course of harassment towards his victim. On March  this year the victim told police she had broken up with the defendant but he continued to contact her. He continued to send flowers and leave voicemails asking her to call him. She replied saying aposI am blocking your calls and voicemails donapost call me again. Stop harassing me.Leave me alone we are not together any more. Do not contact me anywhere.apos But he left her  messages in March,  in April, seven in May. After the victimaposs father died he sent messages to her reporting to be her friend Nick and sent her a condolence card. On the day of her fatheraposs funeral he messaged her saying he had been in a dark place had continued to send messages and cards after from a number of dferent accounts on Plenty of Fish- which all used the same photograph of him.  On May  he sent a vacuum cleaner part to her address which she believes he did to have a reason to contact her. Between  June and  June this year he contacted a friend of the victim numerous times asking about her. On June  he sent her a Pandora ring which she had owned when they were together with tape attached to it. Green later told police he thought Miss Murby had PTSD and that she was blaming him for it. He said he blamed her for him being on anti-depressants. In mitigation his lawyer Steven McHugh said: He is mortied at the position he is in today. He fears going to prison and is taking things seriously. He is not looking for favours and is realistic. The last point of contact was on  June and he wishes to move on with his le. He does not object to the restraining order. He does not wish to reacquaint himself with the complainant. He did not threaten her when he contacted her and had a mistaken belief that contacting her would resurrect the relationship. He pleaded guilty at he earliest opportunity and accepts there was no provocation at all.

While they wouldnapost have been able to travel to the island for this yearaposs getaway, they could have picked to visit one of the countries on the UKaposs travel list - but opted for something closer to home.

If they did have self-isolate they wouldnapost have been able to carry out their royal duties - which theyaposve just started again following lockdown - and they werenapost willing to take the risk of missing engagements. Kate and William were seen cycling across the stunning island of Tresco on Thursday. A holidaymaker said: “William and Kate were riding their bicycles, having a laugh. They looked so happy enjoying the weather.“I did do a double take.

The lockdowns came into force at midnight - coinciding with an important holy date on British Muslimsapos religious calendar. Has your Eid been affected by the new lockdown measures  If so get in touch: webnews@trinitymirror Eid al-Adha, aposThe Feast of Sacrice,apos begins today and traditionally is a time for families to gather and celebrate together. Familiesapos preparations for meals together will be in tatters in affected northern areas, as gatherings are restricted to households once again. Mosques in the north which had been painstakingly planning socially-distant Eid prayers have however received clarity they can go ahead. The decision sparked widespread fury in the affected counties, as the new restrictions were announced suddenly last night - leaving many Brits with unanswered questions about the new rules. Visiting people at home or even in gardens is now banned in vast swathes of northern England.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock stoked further confusion this morning when he told the BBC people could still visit pubs and restaurants in the lockdown areas - but only with their own household. But as Adil explained on GMB: You have to remember for the the Muslim community, theyaposre not gonna go to pubs itaposs not really their thing, so the idea of having it at home is the core element. Baroness Sayeeda Warsi told GMB the lockdown rules that kick in today remain unclear to many people in affected areas. She said: Itaposs till unclear had phone calls this morning right through to am, into the early hours of the morning saying aposwell what does that mean apos  Because thereaposs still not clarity on whether you can meet outdoors, thankfully there was some clarication that those mosques that had already prepared for Covid Eid prayers with the proper procedures in place would be allowed to go ahead. But i think the lack of clarity and the lateness of the message hasnapost encouraged what effectively throughout the pandemic has been a community-wide response across the UK. Mr Hancock this morning denied that the action taken was being aimed at curtailing Eid celebrations. Asked on BBC’s Today programme whether the measures were announced late on Thursday night to stop Eid celebrations from taking place, he said: “No, my heart goes out to the Muslim communities in these areas because I know how important the Eid celebrations are. “I’m very grateful to the local Muslim leaders, the imams in fact, across the country who’ve been working so hard to find a way to have Covid-secure celebrations. “For instance celebrating Eid in parks where there’s more space available and of course outdoors is safer than indoors.” The new lockdowns broaden the restrictions imposed due to an outbreak in Oldham, in Greater Manchester, earlier this week. Oldham Council said there had been a spike in cases in younger people in their twenties and thirties, with many cases arising in Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities.  Household spread had been a aposreal issueapos, the council said, with multiple iniduals from the same household testing positive. Oldham Mosque Council considered whether it was safe to hold Eid prayers, but decided to go ahead with extra measures in place after consulting all the mosques in the town. Oldham resident Asghar Mahmoods told the Manchester Evening News before the new lockdowns were revealed: Itaposs not great news for the Asian community in general, not being able to interact with families and loved ones. Itaposs one of those things - people need to be a bit more educated. Itaposs definitely impacted on our plans. But you make a bad situation into a good one. We can use technology to speak to our families. Itaposs not all doom and gloom.the weather is good we can sit in gardens. What is Eid al-Adha  The second Eid of the year, Eid al-Adha begins today and comes after Muslims made the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Hajj usually sees millions of Muslims visiting the holy mosque but Mecca heavily restricted the traditional annual pilgrimage this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The hotel chain, which is now starting to open for business, has come up with a genius soluition to inspire Brits seeking a change of scenery after months of lockdown. Premier Inn, which is opening its hotels in phases, is taking the phrase aposa change of sceneryapos to a whole new level with a unique ‘view-finder’ to help people choose where to staycation.With thousands of Brits sharing their desperation for a change of scenery during lockdown on Twitter, Premier Inn has developed a solution which will replace their repetitive lockdown views with some of the stunning landscapes available to Premier Inn customers this summer.The ‘Change of Scenery’ device fits over your existing window, using a k digital screen – the latest in home viewing technology – to replace the view with a stream of the best views across the country - handpicked from a selection of Premier Inn’s  locations.  To change the view, users simply press a button on a remote control, just like changing channel on your TV. The device offers a view for every mood, including city landscapes, the classic seaside, breath-taking countryside or historic destinations. It’s the perfect solution for Brits who are looking to upgrade the boring view from their home or ‘window shop’ for their summer break destination. The first trial of the new Change of Scenery Window service took place at a family home in London, where the owner described the dull view as one of the most uninspiring parts of lockdown and a reason for the family’s eagerness to have a change of scenery. The hotel chain is looking at ways to roll the service out for Brits who are unable to travel this summer, ensuring they can still enjoy the beauty of Britain from the comfort of their home.  For those who cannot wait for the full service, a compilation of some of the country’s best views will be made available to stream via the brand’s YouTube channel. It allows Brits to simply turn the screens in their home into windows with views of some of the nation’s most loved locations including London, Durham, Newcastle and more. Plus, as the UK starts to ease out of lockdown, more views from around the UK will be added including Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland so Brits can find inspiration for whatever type of trip they are looking forward to. Premier Inn’s Managing Director Simon Ewins said: “We know many of our guests are bored of the view from their home, so we wanted to create a way to give them a taste of the beautul views available to them this summer, when staying with Premier Inn.  With an enhanced cleaning regime and some great deals available so people can book and stay safely with confidence, we’re really looking forward to welcoming guests for a staycation as summer really starts to get underway.” With online searches for UK staycations increasing by over % in comparison to the average of the past three years , it’s clear that many people are itching to make the most of their summer in Britain. To ensure Brits can make the most of their staycations, Premier Inn has thousands of rooms from £, and with plenty of value on offer, now is the perfect time to book a great value stay in hundreds of locations across the UK.

Sun-seekers were pictured piling onto beaches, including Bournemouth and Brighton, to make the most of the mini heatwave. Parts of the UK are expected to be hotter than Ibiza as the  mile-wide Spanish Plume brings continental heat. But Public Health England’s Heatwave Plan warned there could be travel disruption for Brits heading for the coast. And there is the possibility of thunderstorms later in the evening. The health bodyaposs weather advice says: “At C, tarmac roads may begin to melt.” Roasting temperatures are predicted in much of England, with the hottest temperatures of C predicted in London and the South East. Bournemouth is bracing to be slammed by tourists once again after the beach was swamped on the .C hottest day of the year on June . Major incidents had to be declared at beaches including the popular Dorset beauty spot during Juneaposs heatwave, as sunbathers amassed huge crowds in breach of social distancing guidelines. Tesco predicted selling a BBQ and beer rush, with projected sales of almost a million sausages, half a million burgers and five million bottles and cans of beer.The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “Itaposs a Fab Friday for most – but watch out for thunderstorms later in the South and East in particular.” Another Met Office forecaster said: “Thundery showers are possible later on Friday. “It will be a much cooler weekend though, with temperatures C or more lower on Saturday, with some rain moving from the west later on Sunday to across the South on Monday.” The UK average temperature for this July is currently on course to be just .C, one degree less than the - long-term average of .C, data from the Met shows. So far this month, the highest maximum temperature recorded was .C on July  at Heathrow Airport. The UK has already surpassed % of the average monthly rainfall and only experienced two thirdsof the expected sunshine for an average July, a total of . hours, Met Office figures show. Weaposve not seen a temperature anywhere above  so far or even with a three in it, that is quite unusual for July, a Met spokesman said.

Two vets, who had not treated Buddy, but reviewed his medical records for National Geographic, told the publication that the dog probably had cancer. It is unclearBuddy died from complications connected to the killer virus or lymphoma he may have had, National Geographic reports. The magazine reported: Itaposs unclear whether cancer made him more susceptible to contracting the coronavirus, orthe virus made him ill, orit was just a case of coincidental timing. Buddyaposs owner Robert Mahoney tested positive for Covid- in the spring and when the dog fell ill in April he suspected he had the virus too. However it wasnapost until mid-May that the family found a vet who was prepared to test him. The test confirmed Buddy was infected with the virus. Mr Mahoneyaposs we Allison told the National Geographic: You tell people that your dog was positive, and they look at youten heads.  The US Department of Agriculture confirmed Buddy was the first dog to test positive for the coronavirus in the US on June . They reported at the time that he would make a full recovery but Buddyaposs health deteriorated. On July , Mrs Mahoney told National Geographic that she found Buddy throwing up clotted blood.

There have been claims of ghost sightings and spooky goings-on at Loftus Hall in Fethard on Sea, County Wexford, after the property became the setting for a terrying mythical incident told to have taken place about  years ago.The imposing home, priced at £.m, features impressive Georgian architecture, stunning landscaped grounds and  bedrooms, as reported by the Irish Mirror.The manor became a tourist attraction in , being used for ghost hunts and tours, and it has also has also provided the backdrop for horror films and paranormal invesigations.Itaposs being sold by owners Aidan and Shane Quigley, but potential buyers have been warned of a spooky history that dates back to  when it was known as Redmond Hall. The legend goes one night a mysterious guest called at the home, then occupied by Lord and Lady Tottenham, and their daughter Lady Anne. As a storm raged outside, the family invited the man inside to shelter and the story claims as they played a game to pass the time, Lady Anne bent down to retrieve a fallen playing card from under the table to discover their guest had the aposcloven hooves of the devilapos.  The daughter let out a blood-curdling scream and the satanic visitor is said to have disappeared through the ceiling in a puff of flames and smoke. Lady Anne apparently aposwent into a state of shock and madnessapos before she was forcefully locked away in a tapestry room, dying not long afterwards. Following her death, the family and the servants in the manor claimed to have seen her spirit roaming the halls.  There is always a feeling that you are not alone in Loftus Hall, said Aidan. The once grand interior has now faded but among the peeling wallpaper and decaying ing, there are glimpses of its past splendour with parquet floors, ornate fireplaces and rolling views from its  windows. The site date backs to  when a Norman knight, Raymond le Gros, built a castle on the grounds, before it was replaced by a hall after the black death.

Nikole Thompson, who has two kids, explained that she is moving into a new build property soon with her family. So to keep her home in tip top shape she created a daily, weekly, monthly and annual schedule. The self-proclaimed avid cleaner works  hours per week, but still manages to tackle chores that most of us would be keen to avoid every morning like emptying the toaster or deep cleaning the coffee machine. She took to the Hinch Army Cleaning Tips group on Facebook to share her y list with fellow mums - but she received a mixed response. Day to day Nikole will make all of the beds, wipe down the bathroom, do a load of washing, before hoovering and heading to the kitchen. But she also set aside a list of tasks that need to be completed monthly, like washing the dog beds and cleaning the oven. In April she steam-cleans the carpets and in December she polishes the Christmas decorations.  Talking of the cleaning plans, one person said: Iaposm far too lazy to be this organised but well done you!! Another asked: Do you have a template at all  I struggle a lot with lack of motivation and canapost get anything done. This would help so much to tick off each day week or month. A third commented: I think this is brilliant! Well done you for being so organised! I’m going to try and take a leaf out of your book! You sound like superwoman to me added a fourth.  However one added: Le is too short. Someone once said to me, live le, no one wants to be remembered for cleaning their house. And another said: Blimey do you do anything but clean  As some people still couldnapost believe how much she cleans every day, she was forced to explain just how long it takes on average to complete each task. Daily tasks include:Make beds -  minutes, my son makes his own bed and i just straighten it upTidy up all rooms -  minutes, putting hair make up stuff away and the odd toy Pick up washing -  minute - the boys in this house have a decent aim. Wipe down bathrooms - a minute per bathroom - so maybe  minutes in total giving  minutes to get between the  Put in a load - again no more than  minutes Hoover downstairs -  minutes Empty dishwasher -  minutes Hoover upstairs -  minutes Wipe down work tops -  minutes Wipe down cabinets -  minutes Load dishwasher -  minutes Clean toilets -  minutes So all in all -  minutes  Plus give it five minutes rising and drying the dog food, maybe another five minutes generally cleaning the dining table, extra sweep of the floor after tea etc, wiping down the hob. On a weekend, its probably more like an hour a day with the extras on the Sat Sunday cleaning. Although most members were supportive of Nikoleaposs rigid cleaning schedule, she did receive some criticism which she later addressed. Responding she wrote: Can I just say that I love my children and husband very much. I work  hours a week and manage no problem to spend quality time with them. This cleaning I already do but I like a good visual, which also helps with delegation.

A loud thud can be heard in the footage - thought to be the sound of the Brit hitting rocks under the water. The man was admitted to intensive care with injuries said to have included broken bones and a spinal problem. One of the astonished Spaniards who filmed the scene could be overheard telling a pal: “They’re f*****g mad” as they watched the Brit overlooking the water beside a friend while he prepared to jump. The injured man, who is  years old and in Ibiza’s Can Misses Hospital, has not been named. Hospital chiefs have yet to confirm overnight reports he has now been moved from intensive care to a trauma unit. The alarm was raised at roughly pm on Wednesday. Firefighters led the rescue, although local police, Civil Guard and paramedics were also mobilised by a regional government-run emergency response coordination centre.Cap Negret is well-known in Ibiza as one of the best places in Ibiza to see the sun go down. In August  a British holidaymaker died in Ibiza after leaping off a clf and hitting rocks in a freak accident while celebrating his th birthday. Paul Gardner, from North Shields, ed into the sea at a cove near San Antonio called Cala Gracio.

Citizens who live in or travel to regions of the Asian country bordering China are being forced to sign a pledge confirming they will never defect, according to reports. The dictator is now requiring anyone in the hermit kingdom traveling to border areas to submit a document with their finger print and a confirmation they will not permanently leave. The extra red tape - which came into place earlier this month - is causing major disruption to business, wedding and funeral travel in a country where the  million residents already need special domestic travel permits. One person who lives in the North Hamgyong province told Radio Free Asiaaposs Korean Service prior to the new regulations, citizens had to verbally declare they had no plans to defect - while showing a certicate of citizenship as well as character references. Stamping another fingerprint to get a travel certicate is not that dficult, but it is unpleasant that so many confirmation documents have been added, and people going to the border areas feel frustrated that they are being treated as potential escapees, they said. The restrictions are part of a government campaign to discredit exiles after anti government propaganda leaflets were floated across the border from South Korea.  According to reports, some citizens are missing important family events because they did not prepare the necessary documents in advance. One source is reported as saying those who live near border areas are always treated as potential escapees. One resident of the Ryanggang province on the Chinese border told RFA they have to pass through checkpoints with ID cards, as well as up to five certicates and the written pledge. Meanwhile, relatives of those who flee the country while traveling to the border region are subject to punishments including internal exile.

The brave pooch Emma Roo was rescued in  from a butchers in Xi’an, China, but not before she had her front legs, part of her tail and the tips of her ears cut away.  She was only about eight weeks old at the time, rescuers believe, and may have been given to meat traders because of a small toe defect. Most of the animals killed for the meat trade in China are stolen or abandoned pets or guard dogs, as well as stray street dogs snatched from towns and cities. Slaughterhouses in the dog meat industry remove an animal’s limbs without any pain relief as they believe it produces adrenaline, which tenderises the remaining meat. After being rescued and taken to a veterinary practice in Bejing, Emma was rehomed for two years, before winding up back at the same clinic in .  The Chinese clinic then turned to Dalmatian Rescue, a US non-profit organisation, in their quest to get Emma a loving forever home. Lelong Dog lover Misha Rackclf Hunt, ,  from Charleston, South Carolina spotted Emma online and fell in love immediately.  I remember first seeing Emma online - she has the most human-like amber coloured eyes. I didnapost even think about the logistics of it. I knew this dog was set to me for a reason. When I met her, I thought she might be cold or not interested in people from the trauma but she came up straight into my arms. By the time we finished our five-hour road trip home, itaposs like she knew I was her person and that I was never going to leave her.  Misha took the dog in - who is now as playful and loving as any other pet. She said: “Eventually, Emma arrived in the US on January ,  – just weeks before the export of animals was banned due to Covid-. “When I first brought her home, she would scream at the top of her lungs whenever I left the room.

However, it’s also a chance to lay down a marker.Grab a positive result there and the Dark Blues head into two home games on the bounce with Morton and newly-promoted Raith Rovers coming to town before the end of October – an opportunity to get off to a flying start.On the back of a trip to face Ayr, Dundee play Dick Campbell’s Arbroath at Dens before a Highlands clash with Inverness and then facing a Dunfermline side that has strengthened well over the past few weeks.After a Boxing Day trip to Dumfries, it’s the only midweek fixture of the campaign – home to Alloa – four days before hosting Hearts in what’s likely to be one of the biggest matches of the calendar for the Dens men.With only  of the  matches before the turn of the year, getting  off to a strong start will be essential to any promotion bid.That’s where the fixture list looks to be in Dundee’s favour – successive home games against the Jambos, Ayr and Inverness with trips to Raith and Arbroath in between.That run from the start of the year through to March’sto Tynecastle will be the key to success for James McPake and his men before heading into the final eight matches.The Dark Blues won’t be too happy with the card they’ve been dealt by the SPFL but defiance in the face of adversity is a trait at Dens Park.And come the final day on a Friday night at Queen of the South, the players will still fancy they can finish up on top and get the club back to the big time – eventhey have to do it the hard way.A full fixture list can be found here.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I was lucky enough to play under Ivanin  but I’d lost three before we’d managed to get one.“Jim was manager for a few before then as well so that was probably big thing for him, not being able to do the clean sweep of Scottish football.“Aberdeen were the benchmark, with the New Firm at the time, the two of us were competing against one another.“Them having won European titles probably was sore for him, especially having gone so close.“You look at Roma and then Gothenburg it was, obviously, a big thing for him.”Bowman, who would go on to make  appearances for the club, checked in at Tannadice in  and was part of United’s efforts to make the Uefa Cup showpiece that season.They, arguably, could go down in history as the club’s greatest-ever side.However, the former Hearts man was quick to hail McLean’s title-winning side of  as the best of all.“I would still say when they won the league in  was their best team, what an achievement that was for the club,” he added.“But he kept on evolving the team by bringing myself, Jim McInally and Iain Ferguson to the club in .“When I look back at my time, the players I played with were absolutely brilliant.“They were top professionals as well with the way they conducted themselves off the park. That’s probably why they got so much success.“The likes of Heggie , Davey , Eamonn , Luggy , Holtyand Maurice , they were all great.“For Jimmy Mac, Fergie and I to come into that, playing with them week-in, week-out, it certainly makes your football a lot easier to do.”Bowman looks back on their European adventures with great fondness, hailing the Arabs as some of the best supporters on the continent.“When you look back at the  Uefa Cup run and we were playing Lens in the first round, there wasn’t loads of press and fans but the hype grew as we went on,” he continued.“As we went through the rounds you could see it building.“The fans were brilliant. They’d travel everywhere – the crowds for Barcelona, Monchengladbach and Gothenburg in the final were exceptional.“People even came to Romania to see us play Craiova, it was an Iron Curtain country at the time so that was dficult for their visas and getting there.“It just shows you exactly what United fans were and are still about.”LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-dundee-united-fc-micky-mellon embed # secretKqynNAaff\" data-secret\"KqynNAaff\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I was only there for two years but we have stayed in touch ever since.“The more that I worked with him, you could see he thinks about the game a lot.“Sometimes when you play, you do your own thing and go home. You don’t really think about the game.“But I think he studied it a wee bit more and I saw that the longer I was with him,# added the Tannadice number two.“His accent is still broader than mine and he has been down there for years.“Seriously, coming here is a great opportunity for me and I am delighted he gave me the call.“I actually spoke to Micky a lot and I met him just before lockdown, paying him a visit at Tranmere.“I knew his ideas and thoughts on the game and I was up here last week speaking to him as well.“I am getting to know what he wants. At times our ideas might dfer but his are the ideas that matter so it is up to me along with the rest of the guys to get that message onto the players as best we can.”LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-dundee-united-fc-micky-mellon embed # secretzkvLKPr\" data-secret\"zkvLKPr\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The second woman was wearing a blue jacket.Detective Sergeant Emma Low of Aberdeen CID said: #Deliberately setting fires is inherently dangerous and this may well have had more serious consequences.#Our inquiries are ongoing and I would urge anyone who may have seen any suspicious activity or who may have private CCTV or dashcam footage from the area to get in touch.#Anyone with information can contact police on , quoting incident  of  July, or call Crimestoppers on   .#Meanwhile, Kenny Taylor, who lived in the Printfield Terrace flat across the hall from Sunday#s inferno told how he and his family fled the blaze.The family is now living in temporary accommodation.Kenny, who lived in the flat with his partner and three children was woken by sounds of shouting and screaming and was faced with a wall of fire outside his front door.The -year-old described moment he was forced to consider jumping from his first-floor flat, with his partner then needing to throw his children, aged one-and-a-half,  and , from the window before neighbours were able to rescue them.He said: #I went to spy hole and all I could see was flames. I couldn#t open the door#We ran into the far away bedroom and opened the window right up. The neighbours were throwing mattresses down, we were ready to jump.#At the last minute neighbours from the next block with buckets of water put the fire out and we were able to get to the front door.#We were ready to jump. I would have jumped and my partner would have had to throw me the kids.#We would have had to throw them out the window with my partner jumping last.#Five families, along with Kenny#s, were forced out of their beds at am after a fire was started at the door of a first floor flat.Pictures from inside the council-owned granite block show extensive damage to the fire-hit flat, with properties above and below also suffering damage.Since being forced from their flat, the family of five have been living in temporary accommodation in the city centre.Kenny has praised their council for their help so far, adding they had been given a rough timescale for getting back into their property.He said: #We#ve been able to collect what we needed from the flat and have been told it will be three to four weeks before our side of the building can move back in, once the landing has been repaired.#And he told of the impact the fire has had on his family, saying: #The kids lives have been turned upside down. They#re not doing good at all. The only time they#re settling is when we take them to other family to mix with kids.#It#s being made ten times worse, because this was not an accident.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Now more than ever these communities need the opportunity – and funds – to put their plans into action.“The community capacity funding is designed to help kickstart long-term change, driven by local people, while the environment programme will support projects that are ‘oven-ready’.“Together these programmes reflect our drive to invest in and enable green recovery at a local level. We want to help communities get on with doing what they do best – responding to local needs in a way that provides lasting benefits.”Cabinet Secretary for the environment, climate change and land reform Roseanna Cunningham said: “The launch of Crown Estate Scotland’s Sustainable Communities Fund will provide tangible support to help deliver a green recovery in coastal communities – who are also benefitting this year from £. million of Crown Estate asset revenues # as well as its rural estates.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

There was quite a lot of interest in Pipsqueak, but once Mrs Murray#s had done all their checks they offered us the chance to take him in.#Anne added: #He doesn#t show any tendencies of a dog who has been abused and he#s very affectionate. He loves cuddles.#He#s looking so much better than he did # he#s now got a really lovely coat.#The couple now want other prospective dog owners to consider rehoming and giving a pet a second chance.Anne said: #Pipsqueak is  and is happy just to be cuddled for the rest of his le. We are lucky to be able to do that.#Rehoming has been great for him, but it#s also had a very positive impact on us. You can#t underestimate how important it is for a household.#I#d definitely encourage people to do it.#Neil Raffan, assistant manager at Mrs Murray#s, said: #We really try to promote adopting a dog because by doing it, you are giving a dog a second chance at le in a forever home they are suited to.#We are always trying to get that message through to people, because it can make a huge dference to a dog#s le.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary.

There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

Here is some advice on how to take advantage of the great outdoors and get the whole family fit this summer.The summer months offer us all the perfect opportunity to make changes to improve our mental and physical health. Getting active is good for your body and mind, and there are lots of easy ways to get active. Taking a brisk walk every day will help shed the pounds, but there is nothing better than heading out into the great outdoors to take in some of the wonderful countryside and coastal sites close to home. There are fabulous woodlands, beaches and picnic spots everywhere. And you don’t have to just go walking. Cycling has become ever more popular during lockdown and swimming in rivers and lakes is another wonderful way to get the blood pumping and improve your health. A survey taken at the start of lockdown revealed that one in four of us admitted that we were more active than before lockdown.This increased to one in three as lockdown continued, with combatting lockdown weight gain and helping mental health given as the top reasons many people are turning to some form of physical exercise. There is so much to choose from to keep you active from dusk to dawn.From aerial assault courses to horse riding treks, there are a massive range of outdoor family activities and endless possibilities for days out packed with family-friendly outdoor activities.No matter where you are, lakes and waterways make for not only incredibly scenic views but also cover a whole range of activities.The United Kingdom’s  National Parks also contain some of the nation’s most beautul and inspiring landscapes.You’ll find some of the best walking, cycling and horse riding locations and a whole host of other adventure activities in the spectacular parks.Add nearly  Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and you’ll find you’re spoilt for choice when it comes to exploring our famous countryside and keeping fit.NOTE: Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have dferent guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Whether you are heading for the hills, planning a coastal stroll or fancy splashing about in the sea or a lake, make sure you take time to check out what you need to do to stay safe.Visit visitbritain know-before-you-go to learn more about heading outdoors safely.Walking in Scotland means mighty mountains to conquer, plenty of forest paths or coastal walks to meander along, charming villages to discover, and exciting city routes to explore.Whether you’d like to enjoy a walking holiday, or simply an afternoon’s amble, you’re definitely in the right place when you are in Scotland.  What are you waiting for It’s time to explore one of Scotland’s best assets – the great outdoors Scotland’s Great Trails, such as the West Highland Way, the Great Glen Way, Fe Coastal Path and the Southern Upland Way are among the best walking routes in the world for experienced hikers and take you through some outstanding scenery. They’re fantastic for those who want to discover the country on foot, by bike or even, along one route, in a canoe.The trails are distinctively waymarked, largely off-road and traffic free and have a range of visitor services along the way.  You can take the family and walk or bike a route in small sections on an afternoon or day trip, or plan a multi-day epic and tackle a trail in one go.If you decide to opt for a multi-day walk or want to stay overnight, check out businesses that are part of the Walkers Welcome scheme.Learn more at visitscotland see-do active walkingAdults should  aim to be physically active every day.  They should attempt to do strengthening activities that work all the major muscles in the legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms on at least two days a week.It is also recommended that people do at least  minutes of moderately intense activity every week, or  minutes of vigorously intense activity a week.However, people need to make sure the type and intensity of activity is appropriate for their level of fitness, and take medical advicenecessary.Moderate activity such as brisk walking, riding a bike and hiking will raise your heart rate, and make you breathe faster and feel warmer.  One way to tellyou’re working at a moderate intensity level isyou can still talk, but not sing.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

There are a lot of young people for whom the real world is more amazing than anything you could make up.\"Again, thats another thing were born with that gets beaten out of us, and we start using the word ordinary ndash and theres nothing ordinary.\"Were surrounded by magic. You think Harry Potters magic  Just look around you.\"That curiosity is our biggest asset because thats how we learn to adapt, thats how we learn to survive, thats how we learn to cope with the world around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt new things during their years in home-schooling.Particularly that of one of his daughters who was astonished to learn all about Antarctica ndash home of her then favourite animal, the penguin.\"I believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy, and here we are, face to face, learning about it and discovering things together, then there is nothing more inspiring than engaging with a nine or -year-old.\"Chris Lloyds Humanimalbook event will be

Then, McAllister recommends, lsquoIf you know yoursquoll be wearing your mask for a long period of time I would suggest applying a thin layer of Aquaphor Healing Ointment to the areas that will come in direct contact with the mask.rsquoYou can also try an anti-chafing balm, like Body Glide which is is a favourite of Reviewed staffers who run. Apply it on areas where your mask typically rubs against your skin, like the nose, cheeks, chin, or ears.Keep in mind, too you should wash your face mask regularly in the laundrymdashand McAllister agrees. She suggests using a detergent specically for sensitive skin thats free of any dyes or perfumes.Bonus: If you have the luxury of picking and choosing your mask , McAllister says the type of fabric can make a big dference in your masks comfort. She recommends a soft cotton fabric thats more breathable than other alternatives.McAllister says once again to start with Aquaphoryou notice any irritation or discomfort.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet.

But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

Those that belong to the pea and bean familyfor example, in summer, can store nitrogen in their roots,that can be ploughed back into the earth.Which crops make good green manures At this time of year they include mustard, fodder radish, fenugreek, buckwheat and phacelia, which can be slotted in in six to eight week gaps when the ground is cleared between crops. Some sown in early autumn, including winter beans, grazing rye and winter tares, will last through the winter and can be dug into the soil when it warms up in spring.How long do they take to grow Some, such as mustard, are fast-germinating. Two weeks after sowing youll find the ground covered with small seedlings, and after six weeks, these can be chopped and folded into the soil to add nutrients.Fenugreek is another nitrogen-fixer for summer, really fast growing and its bushy plants are great for suppressing weeds. It can be planted in late spring or summer and grown for up to three months.When do I cut them down Chop the fast-growing ones when you need the ground back. Just dig them up, chopping up the leaves and stems as you go to speed up decomposition. Leave them a few days to wilt and then dig them into the soil.Longer term crops such as alfalfa, red clover and trefoil can be left in the ground for a year and clipped from time to time to stop them from going woody. They are ideal for soil thats been overused and needs to rest.What benefits do they provide Clover, fenugreek, winter beans and alfalfa are good nitrogen-fixers, storing nitrogen in their roots, while clover and phacelia flowers are a magnet for beneficial insects, which can help pollinate crops, so leave some to flower. Italian ryegrass and buckwheat have root systems that will help break up heavy ground.When can I plant crops in the space again A few weeks after youve dug in your green manure, you can sow late crops such as onion and garlic.WhatI want to wait If you have no crops to fill the space, cover the green manure-treated bed with cardboard or landscape fabric to keep the nutrients from the green manure in, which will give you a great seedbed to sow seeds in come spring.What  can I grow to help my crops Try growing comfrey, which absorbs nutrients and minerals and can be made into a liquid feed. Just cut it down to the ground, fill a bucket with the leaves and stems of the plant, packing them in tightly and then filling the bucket with water.Set it aside for three weeks , then strain off the liquid into a container with a tight lid. When you want to feed your plants, dilute the liquid with water at a ratio of around : and feed your plants weekly into autumn."},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-10-best-gardens-visit-summer","story":"Still short of things to do during summer holidays  Why not visit some of our most glorious gardens, which have reopened to the public.They all detail the Covid- safety measures theyve put in place on their websites.

I hope I win the lottery on Saturday but that doesnt mean it is going to happen.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, was a hasty addition to the line-up. On a typical Sunday, Ridge has to make do with grabbing pavement interviews with Ministers when they are on their way to The Andrew Marr Show. This time, Mr Raab was live in the studio, at the requisite two metre social distance.No worker following quarantine guidance should be penalised by employers, he said, including by being put onto sick pay.\"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they cant have penalties taken against them.\"As for his ministerial colleague Mr Shapps being caught on the hop, the Foreign Secretary said it showed the risks for everyone.Mr Raab could not guarantee other countries would follow Spain and be taken off the ldquosafe list.\"All we can say is weve got this Joint Biosecurity Centre, we monitor the risk in real time, we take decisive swt action and so there is an element of uncertainty this summerpeople go abroad.

You can read what he had to say in full where in the paper, but in summary: Boris Johnson was uselessScottish Labour had been uselessand current Labour leader Keir Starmer was proving usefulIt was fairly predictable stuff for the former Prime Minister, except for the end when Ridge asked why he could not seem to wrench himself away from politics.

Therersquos a general acceptance that, rather than sharing culpability with previous generations, we are the ones at whose door it can be laid. Obviously there is a lot of truth in that, as we continue to consume oceans of gas and oil, and despoil the seas with plastic. Yet the culprits for harming nature and tipping it out of kilter can be found in centuries past as well as in the international departure lounges of our airports. We should not shoulder all the blame.Irsquom thinking, as one example in my own backyard, of James V. For all his qualities as a leader he was never as impressive as his father James IV, or even his daughter Mary Queen of Scots. Quite apart from his military deficiencies at the Battle of Solway Moss, James V is the man who introduced , sheep into the Ettrick Valley, to raise money for his ambitious plans. In so doing, he destroyed the ancient Ettrick Forest, in which he and other royals had hunted and killed stags by the barrowload. The kingrsquos flocks arrived a some point after , and it did not take them long to strip the valley of its trees. By our own times, all that was left of this magnicent haven for wildle was a handful of thorn trees and birches. The rest is empty scrubland.I learned about this vandalous act in a newly published collection of essays called A Journey in Landscape Restoration: Carrran Wildwood and Beyond, edited by the biologists Philip and Myrtle Ashmole. Unlike most of the books I read this is not about the past, but about the future. There are almost as many photos as words, but the ones that most vividly illustrate the tale are those taken of the Carrran Valley, in the hills near Moffat.At the end of last century, this was a bleak expanse of severely depleted upland, grazed almost to extinction. A winter photo from  shows it as a dreary unrelieved desert: think of a chocolate brownie and yoursquod be close, though dusted with snow rather than icing sugar. Now, after  years of dedicated work by volunteers, it is growing lush once more. Swathes of native woodland clothe the hillsides, and its increasingly rich undergrowth is attracting an abundance of birds, insects, flowers, fungi and amphibians. The range of moths alone is heart-warming. As before and after images go, the dference could hardly be more striking.Previously you would have been lucky to hear much more than a grouse cackling, or watch a buzzard circling overhead now it is like the RSNO, as a sorts of birdle, from meadow pippits to willow warblers, wrens and winchats, strike up from the branches of native trees: birch, aspen, ash, oak, willow, rowan, hazel, Scots pine and juniper.In a series of pithy pieces,  of those who helped bring about this transformation describe how they went about it. Philip Ashmole originally had the idea to recreate an area of woodland in the Borders that replicated how it would have been before humans arrived. Out of this notion the Wildwood Group was established, which later formed itself into the Borders Forest Trust. On Millennium Day, the trust took ownership of the Carrran Valley, and set to work on creating a wildwood.In subsequent years, other ecological restoration schemes were also begun, at Corehead and Devilrsquos Beef Tub, and Talla and Gameshope. Together these groundbreaking ventures began to restore an area they have named The Wild Heart of Southern Scotland. Inspired by their example, others are now following their lead across the country.Living as I do in one of the great medieval sheep rearing districts of the Borders, in the vicinity of Melrose Abbey, itrsquos not hard to see the effect  and more years of grazing have had on the landscape. As one of the contributors to this book writes, sheep are engrained in our economy and culture, and they are the main reason, along with other herbivores such as voles, deer, goats and rabbits, why native woodland planting is rare: ldquoItrsquos no mystery: sheep eat trees. As flocks expanded, their predators ndash wolves and lynx ndash were killed, so that today other grazers, and especially deer, roam and breed without any natural check.The Borders Forest Trustrsquos vision was aided by bodies like the Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage, but its core remained a motivated army of volunteers. Many of these came with scientic credentials ndash geographers, botanists, ornithologists, ecologists and such like. Others were simply determined to help re-establish wilderness in barren terrain. One weekend last autumn,  members of the Glasgow branch of Extinction Rebellion arrived at Gameshope, and in two days helped plant , trees. In the words of Anna Craigen, the trustrsquos work would been impossible without volunteers: ldquoThey are our muscles, brains, eyes, dirty hands and the true heart of the Wild Heart.What is so uplting about this story is not just the determination and imagination of those who have made all this happen, but the tangible evidence of the regeneration they have promoted. Page after page of A Journey in Landscape Restoration is filled with photos of wildle now thriving in Carrran.Amid the bad news headlines about climate change, and images of bush fires, floods and landslides, it is good to be reminded of the things being done to turn the tide. Work such as that in Carrran Wildwood not only restores nature to its rightful state, but gives a terric boost to our own depleted sense of hope.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The film has been more-or-less finished for almost a year, but like many films such as the latest Bond, it has been pushed back due to the coronavirus pandemic. Originally scheduled for July , the film has been delayed three times and even briefly taken off the roster entirely, triggering worried chatter from film fans.But now itrsquos finally coming out The filmrsquos producersrsquo Warner Bros. have announced Tenet will be releasing in  countries, a list that notably includes South Korea, Germany and the UK, but not the United States. The odds are in favour of the film debuting in Scotlandrsquos cinemas on August  as the producers have likely already lost signicant sums due to repeated postponements.Whatrsquos it all about Under Nolanrsquos all-seeing-eye, the cast and crew have taken a vow of silence on the inner workings of the film. Piecing together clues from trailers and marketing packages, the basic outline of the film appears to centre around the protagonist, played by John David Washington , who works for a shady organisation called Tenet. Washington is tasked with preventing global catastrophe by securing a device that seems able to reverse the flow of time: for example, the trailer features a car crash occurring in reverse, and a building littered in bullet holes from a shoot-out that hasnrsquot yet occurred. For those familiar with Nolanrsquos work, time-meddling will come as no surprise.Time-meddling  Can you be more specic Nolan is famous for fiddling with the flow of time in unconventional ways in many of his movies. Interstellar uses Einsteinrsquos theory of Relativity to show Matthew McConaugheyrsquos character, aboard a super-fast spaceship, experience a slower rate of time than his family back home on Earth, as McConaughey is tragically forced to watch decades pass for his family within the space of a few hours.Inception is infamously indecipherable due to its complicated concept of lsquodreams within dreamsrsquo, where the flow of time slows throughout each new lsquolayerrsquo of dreams. His early work, Memento, throws the concept of watchability almost out the window with the scenes arranged lsquoback-to-frontrsquo and the plot occurring in reverse.So itrsquos going to be totally incomprehensible then Probably not. Most of Nolanrsquos blockbusters are very accessible such as his last big release, Dunkirk, or his acclaimed Dark Knight Batman trilogy. Though his films sometimes contain confusing concepts, they are still an enjoyable experience, especially in the distraction-free cinema environment.Is it worth going to see then If you enjoy Nolanrsquos previous work or the action or thriller genres, itrsquos the film for you. And of course, the film features the biggest and best of Hollywoodrsquos blockbuster glitz, glamour, soundtrack and special effects. Remember to come prepared with sweets and drinks for a two-and-a-half-hour runtime.FINLAY SCOTT"},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-madonnas-latest-controversy","story":"What did she say Madonna shared a video about a coronavirus conspiracy theory on her Instagram account where she has . million followers.

They are also being reminded that there is local support available to them should they find themselves to be the victims of the issue.NFU Scotland Orkney#s regional policy advisor Kerry Omand said: “If anyone finds themselves to be in this unfortunate position there are key steps that they need to take and responsibilities that livestock owners have. I believe that the public are very aware of their rights and responsibilities as dog owners, and our members need to have the same knowledge and confidence in dealing with these situations.”The legislation relating to this is the DogsAct  and #worrying# is defined as attacking livestock, chasing livestock in such a way as may reasonably be expected to cause injury or suffering to the livestock or abortion as well as being at large, not otherwise under close control or on a lead, in a field or enclosure where there are livestock.Kerry highlighted: “There is often an assumption that an attack or incident must be physical for it to be taken seriously, and that is simply not the case as signicant harm can be caused to animals without any direct contact occurring.”If farmers come across an incident of livestock worrying they should contact the police on the incident is ongoing, or dial  to report the incident, try to contain the dogpossible and gather their livestock for treatment and or retain any dead livestock as evidence. Finally, a dog must only be shot as a last resortthey cannot be contained and this should be reported to the police within  hours.Kerry added: “I completely empathise with members who find themselves in this situation, having been the victim of livestock worrying myself. This was a few years ago now, but from that experience I would encourage farmers to gather evidencethey can, in the form of photos or videos of the incident occurring. That may seem like an unnatural thing to do when you are wanting to put an end to the incident as quickly as possible, but it also crucial to have this evidence to hand.”Mark Evans, animal welfare officer with Orkney Islands Council wants to remind dog owners to ensure that their dogs are always under control and avoid going into fields where livestock are grazing.He said“If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land then the owner and or the person in charge of the dog, is guilty of a criminal offence.”Mark reiterates “Farmers should make every effort to catch the dogit is worrying livestock and it is only as a last resort to shoot the dogit is not able to be caught. This needs to be reported to the Police and to the Councils Trading Standards Service.”Orkney preventions and interventions officer with Police Scotland, Constable Simon Hay said: “The worrying of livestock can have devastating consequences for farm animals and has an obvious financial and emotional impact on farmers and their businesses.“The advice to dog owners or anyone walking and exercising their dogs in the countryside is to ensure they are under control at all times and avoid going into fields where livestock is grazing. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code says dogs should not be taken into fields where there are lambs or other young farm animals.#Police Scotland will enforce the existing legislation robustly, ensuring all reported cases of sheep worrying are thoroughly investigated and offenders reported to the Procurator Fiscal. Farmers and those who use the countryside are urged to report all incidents of livestock worrying to police on  or  in an emergency.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3221834.jpg--.jpg?1594293881000\n","title":"patricia ready to steer inner wheel","story":"BALLYMENA’S Patricia Perry, has been appointed as all Ireland Chairman of the Inner Wheel Organisation.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing! The colour and vibrancy has helped to lighten the mood of everybody in the village and those travelling through it.When in the area look out for the horse and all the displays andyou want to learn more about the work of the Cullybackey Community Partnership, ring Joanne on .

We went some time speaking upon the United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union and seeking to benefit and get the maximum benefit from that, she said. I look forward to greeting members of the Irish government as our next plenary meeting in Armagh in December.Before then we will have a British Irish council meeting to discuss the common travel area, she said. Taoiseach Micheal Martin described the meeting as warm. Mr Martin said the chief medical officers in the Republic and Northern Ireland are working well together and the challenge for both north and south is keeping the community transmission low.There is an agreed position to try and keep working together to optimum level of co-operation north and south. We noted that on the island, the level of community transmission has been brought down to low levels and we hope to keep it there.There was a general discussion on Brexit and our officials have promised to engage on the technical aspects of the protocol.He said the Irish Government will seek a meeting of the British Irish Council to discuss the dferent travel rules between Ireland and the UK.Deputy first minister Michelle O#Neill said after three-and-a-half years, it was good for both administrations to meet again.She said: I#m delighted that we have paved the way for more meetings to take place in the years ahead. I think that when we restored the Assembly and Executive back in January - I don#t think any of us would have predicted that we would have been dealing with a global pandemic.We had a good wide ranging discussion on a iety of issues such as climate, greenways, infrastructure projects, Brexit and Covid-.I think it is interesting that we meet in this format today where we have eight parties in government in some form or other.Our co-operation is more important than ever as will continue to respond to the biggest health emergency we have ever faced and when we reflect on the previous months, we must reflect on the fact that , people have died from Covid on this island alone.Mrs Foster said: Obviously we are very aware of what has been happening in England over the past few days so we do feel the need to have a conversation about the common travel areas.At the moment, the travel area pertains to Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The Republic of Ireland have decided that anyone coming from the common travel area apart from Northern Ireland will need to quarantine so we need to have discussions around that.In relation to international travel, there is a need for a discussion on the location of international travellers as they come through Dublin as there is good sharing of information.In terms of Brexit, we want to see a comprehensive free trade deal, quota free deal and I welcome the commentary in relation to a lack of a border north south. We also don#t want to see borders developing east- west in relation to trade either.Mrs Foster said she would much prefer people from Northern Ireland to holiday at home this year, and people should acknowledge that they may have to quarantinethey are ing from abroad.She said: We had to act in relation to Spain, and Luxembourg has gone on the red list too. What we have said to people in our travel advisory is clear, we would much preferpeople stayed at home and had a #staycation# and discover parts of Northern Ireland they have not been to in a while.Butthey do decide to travel then they need to be aware of the risk and that they may have to quarantine when they come home and I do think we have been clear it is in relation to the risk.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming db .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ddde-af-e-bf-ff_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming db .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ddde-af-e-bf-ff_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming db .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ddde-af-e-bf-ff_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming db .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ddde-af-e-bf-ff_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming db .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ddde-af-e-bf-ff_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandMinisters from Belfast and Dublin to meet to discuss Covid- and BrexitThe first summit of the North South Ministerial Councilsince before Northern Ireland’s powersharing administration collapsed is under way..\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bcbe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bc--d-fb-_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bcbe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bc--d-fb-_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bcbe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bc--d-fb-_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bcbe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bc--d-fb-_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bcbe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bc--d-fb-_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  .\"Northern IrelandArlene Foster rejects speculation her leadership is in questionArlene Foster has rejected speculation her leadership of the DUP may be under threat.Most ReadWidow of surgeon Kyle McDonald recalls #phenomenal husband and father# in moving tribute Sacking of Dunnes manager #who ate food worth £ was justied#Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Arlene Foster #proud# as NI launches first tracing app in UKTyrone crash victim Patrick McGinn#s organs saved six lives, funeral told Woman jailed for spitting in hospital worker#s face at height of coronavirus pandemic ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBack to school costs are pushing a third of parents in Northern Ireland into debt, a survey has revealed. Allan PrestonTwitterEmailJuly   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailBack to school costs are pushing a third of parents in Northern Ireland into debt, a survey has revealed.Research commissioned by the Irish League of Credit Unionssaid % of parents found themselves saddled with debt, averaging £, to cover school costs in . That is up £ on last year.Parents were also questioned about how the pandemic had affected family income and their concerns for the new school term.Overall, parents spent an average of £ on primary school items - up £ or % since , with unorm costs rising £ to £.Secondary school costs dropped slightly to £,, compared to the £, burden on parents last year, with unorm costs increasing by £ to £ and school lunches costing £.Voluntary expenses increased dramatically by %, costing £ per child in primary schools and £ in secondary schools.Although % of parents considered back to school costs a financial burden, this has dropped considerably from the  figure of %.Around three-quartersof parents pay for school supplies out of their monthly outcome, with % using a credit card and % drawing on savings.Similar to last year, a small number of parentsturned to a doorstop lender or payday loan company.Cutting back on family holidays remains the biggest sacrice to pay for school supplies at %, but a signicant drop from % last year.A total of % cut back spending on extracurricular activities, with a thirdhaving to deny their children new shoes.The survey found that the impact of Covid- caused a drop in household income for a third of parents in Northern Ireland.One in foursaid feeding children at home while home schooling was the biggest extra cost.Most parentsexpect a mix of home schooling and classroom learning for the new term, while nearly halfof parents said they were worried their children have fallen behind in their studies at home with many admitting they spent too much time watching TV or with mobile devices.A further % of parents said ing to work would be a struggleschools did not reopen full time.Paul Bailey, ICLU head of communications, said it was good news that less parents felt under pressure over school costs, but urged those struggling to find cheaper forms of finance such as a credit union loan.

The industry reacted with disappointment to the UK government#s decision to impose a -day quarantine on tourists ing from Spain due to its growing level of coronavirus cases. The quarantine also covers Spain#s Canary and Balaeric Islands.TUI, the UK#s biggest tour operator, announced it is shutting around one third of its total of  stores.The decision was made following changes in customer behaviour, the firm said in a statement. Around  retail stores will remain following the closures. However, it would not comment on which Northern Ireland stores were at risk as a consultation is taking place.Tory MPs are putting pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to introduce coronavirus testing at airports to cut the -day quarantine.And a group of  airlines, airports and tourism leaders - including Belfast International Airport chief executive Graham Keddie - have also called on the Prime Minister to introduce virus tests for those arriving in the UK. TUI said stores which are have reopened since the pandemic are not at risk of closure. But only one of its  Northern Ireland stores - a branch at Waterloo Place in Londonderry - have so far reopened. The shutters remain down at branches in Armagh, Coleraine, Lisburn, Newtownards, Ballymena, Craigavon, Omagh, Dungannon and Newry - as well as two branches in Belfast#s CastleCourt Shopping Centre and on Bloomfield Avenue.The chain has  stores in the Republic and is based in Germany.Andrew Flintham, managing director of TUI UK and Ireland, said: We want to be in the best position to provide excellent customer service, whether it#s in a high street store, over the telephone or online, and will continue to put the customer at the heart of what we do. It is therefore imperative that we make these dficult cost decisions, look after our colleagues during such unprecedented uncertainty and also offer a modern customer service.TUI is the latest high street chain after bakery chain Greggs and bookseller Eason to indicate that it won#t reopen at least some of its shops following lockdown.Greggs is closing three of its  stores - while Eason has shut all seven of its remaining Northern Ireland stores.Glyn Roberts, the chief executive of Retail NI, hoped TUI would provide clarication on which stores will be affected by the closure plans.It#s fair to say that this was a company which was facing a signicant challenge before Covid- due to the growth in online holiday bookings, he said.And in other businesses such as Eason which have also faced troubles before Covid, Covid- has now almost finished them off.There are not just the effects from the numbers of jobs lost in retailers, but closures like TUI and Eason also had a knock-on effect as footfall into the area is diminished.The pandemic and lockdown have had a catastrophic effect on demand for overseas holidays, with many bookings cancelled after quarantine was introduced. Yesterday easyJet cancelled a number of its flights.In a letter to Mr Johnson, the bosses of British Airways, easyJet and Jet demanded a more nuanced policy than the -day quarantine.They called for the introduction of regional travel corridors to replace the blanket requirement of -day quarantine for anyone ing from an at-risk country.Transport Secretary Grant Schapps cut his family holiday in Spain short as a result. As he ed to the UK, he defended the UK government#s decision.I very much understand, it obviously had an impact on me and my family, and I#m very, very sorry and upset for the thousands of Brits who are either away or perhaps even haven#t managed to go away this summer as well to Spain, he said.But it#s absolutely essential we acted when we did, it#s why all four nations of the UK acted together and the figures since have turned out to justy that action.We have to, I think, have a clear message and make sure we act by adding entire countries to that list for the time being.People who test positive for coronavirus or display symptoms must now self-isolate for  days as Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned of a second wave starting to roll across Europe.The UK#s chief medical officers said on Thursday that the period must increase from the current rule of seven days because of the risk iniduals may still be able to spread Covid-.In a joint statement, they said the change for those who experience the key symptoms of a new continuous cough, high temperature or loss of taste or smell is needed because of the low but real possibility of infectiousness up to  days.Their move came as official analysis said England had the highest levels of excess mortality in Europe across the first half of .Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumReliance on nursing temps could jeopardise patient safety in Northern Ireland: reportPatient safety could be compromised by a reliance on temporary staff to plug gaps in Northern Ireland#s nursing and midwery sector, a report has warned.Northern Ireland PremiumBelfast#s #Breastival# in plagiarism rowThe organisers of an annual Belfast festival celebrating all things breastfeeding have expressed anger after their name was used by a well-known baby brand to promote a similar event.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

On July , , Ray Cossum set off from France to swim across the English Channel. He completed the journey non-stop in a time of  hours  minutes. In doing so, he became the first Irishman to officially swim across the channel. It had been a long-held ambition for Ray. Born in Folkestone on the south coast of England in , he grew up hearing stories of people who had swam across the channel. It was an ambition he would come back to later in his adventurous le. googletag.cmd.push Ray served in the Royal Nay for eight years, five of which were in the submarine service as an escape instructor. While he was in the Navy, he was based in Derry where he met and married Bridie Loughrey, before the couple set up home and raised a family in Creggan. His love of long-distance swimming was developed and honed in the waters of Lough Swilly in Donegal where he regularly swam between Buncrana and Rathmullan. After much preparation, he decided to take his efforts to another level by attempting the channel swim he had heard so much about when growing up. googletag.cmd.push However, it was not an easy thing to achieve. He tried unsuccessfully twice to complete the swim. However, he finally realised his dream in the summer of . Almost  hours after leaving France, on July , , Ray made it back on to land near his home town of Folkstone. “I had tried to so the swim a couple of times before and on one of those times I was just a couple of miles from finishing it when I had to stop because of gale force winds,” he said. “So it was great to finally manage to swim across the channel and it was a big relief after all the training I had put in.” As a result of his success in , the local man became involved in the Channel Swimming Association which is the official body which regulates channel swims. He later went on to become vice president of the association. He remains proud of his achievement  years ago and the special relationship he has with the Englisn Channel. “I can say that I have worked as a er on the bottom of the English Channel, I have swum the channel, I was vice president of the Channel Swimming Association, I have passed through the channel in submarines, I have been through the Channel Tunnel, I have flown over the channel and passed over the channel on ships,” he said. “So I can say that I have see the channel from every angle possible.” Ray is also well-known locally for his deep-sea ing exploits. In , he bought the rights to the wreck of the SS Laurentic which sank on January ,  after striking a mine at the mouth of Lough Swilly. There were  passengers on-board the ship. Of these,  people died and only  survived. After the Laurentic sank, the Royal Navy organised a huge amount of es over subsequent decades to recover a large number of gold bars which were worth an estimated poundm in . Since buying the rights to the wreck, Ray has organised a large number of es to what remains of the vessel and had also been heavily in preserving artefacts which have been salvaged from it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Desertmartin and Craigbane have dropped from intermediate, to be paired with  junior champions Magilligan. Also in the mix are Moneymore and Drum, who have lost the last two junior deciders. In an interesting subplot, Derry senior captain Chrissy McKaigue and County Chairman Stephen Barker will be in opposing camps. Ballerin have been paired in the other section with Doire Colmcille, Ardmore and Sean Dolans who have struggled to find any kind of form in recent seasons. Craigbane v MagilliganFriday– BanagherRef: Emmet McShane James McGrath s as Craigbane boss, but points to a lack of action in what he describes as a trying season for the players. googletag.cmd.push They learnt a tough lesson against Tyrone side Naomh Eoghan, an amalgamation of Dregish and Newtownstewart. It was their first game since February . Lee Moore ed from Australia but transferred to Dublin club Thomas Davis to train. He is back with his native Craigbane but is on the injured list. He is joined by Bliain Gormley, who made had initially made it back from a gruelling injury. John Kerlin has ed from Australia, but like the rest of the squad is lacking game time. Craigbane have brought through underage talent in recent seasons. Fergal Mortimer in attack is an important player and will be joined this year by Jude Oacuteg Moore and Jude McLaughlin, who has been their main man in attack. googletag.cmd.push Brian Rainey remains as as experienced player, who has coached many of the players coming up through the ranks. In defence Naoise Oacute Mianaacutein, Oisin McCloskey and Conor McLaughlin have made it though and will line out in front of goalkeeper Conor McGuinness. They face Magilligan this weekend, who have former Derry underage player Shane Kealey from Faughanvale in charge, with another Vale man Kevin Morrow and Eamon McLaughlin. Kealey hails the quality of the , while he lamented how small it is. It looks like they will be without Colly Mullan who ended up on crutches after an injury at training. A knee injury has also kept Ciaran OHare out this season. After a good preseason, Kealey has struggled to get challenge games and the latest lockdown after the recent Covid- cases in the local Limavady area hampered their progress further. The Joe Brolly Cup wont be won or lost on Friday night, but the loser will be on the back foot as one team from the group will drop out the race. There shouldnt be much in it, but Craigbane should come through. VERDICT: Craigbane Desertmartin v MoneymoreFriday– LoupRef: Cathal Doherty There is a local derby on Friday night, with Desertmartin and Moneymore crossing paths. Both clubs have new managers. Cookstowns Jason Quinn is at the helm in Moneymore, with clubmate Daire Cummings along with him. They were dealt a blow with goalkeeper Liam Macinnes sustaining a broken leg in training, leaving Derry Chairman Stephen Barker and Padraig Donaghy vying for the number one jersey. Rory Young hasnt committed this season and while Paudie ONeill is back out helping with training, its uncertainhe willto the action on the pitch. Quinn reckons their team this weekend could have  or  players under the age of . Oisin ONeill, Cian ONeill and Abban McCloy have broken into the team in recent years. This season Deaglan Mallon and Lee Colville have joined the . Desertmartin brought in Slaughtneil duo Kevin ONeill and Chrissy McKaigue as their managers, who are assisted by Danny Murray and Ciaran Higgins. The Saffrons have dropped down from the intermediate grade and outside of Ronan McGuckins serious ankle injury sustained early in the season, ONeill report a clean bill of health including Enda McGuckin who has had injury problems. Gavin Donnelly and Eunan McElhennon made their debut last season, with Callum Ormsby coming into the fold this year. In a group where one team will drop out of the championship, there will be a certain bite to all the games. Desertmartin should come through this one.

Woods managed the Wolfhounds to success in  and is joined in the management team by Sean Forrest and former Derry player Karl Diamond. They will have to plan without Ruairi Hassan as his suspension from a sending off against Doire Trasna last season carries over. Woods was happy with preparations earlier in the season, the first time all the players were available with university commitments all behind them. googletag.cmd.push Aside from Conor Boyd , Richard Kingis the next oldest player ahead of the raft of young players who Woods feels are beginning to make GAA their priority. David Brolly is the latest to put his shoulder to the wheel and will be pushing for a start. That said, Woods admits he has a concern that the season could be ended in the blink of an eye with the ongoing situation surrounding Covid across the country. Adrian McGilligan is joined in the Glack management team by Willie Canning and former Doire Colmcille boss Simon Doherty. McGilligan feels the championship is somewhat of a lottery with the lack of preparation and player welfare needs to come first. googletag.cmd.push Back in the fold this year is Tommy OKane who s from a knee injury. After their attractive brand of football last year saw them romp to the junior title, this season has been dferent with football stopped in its tracks. Glack have concerns around Ciaran Carmichael, Cormac Boyle and talisman Niall McGowan ahead of the weekend. There was little between the sides in the last two championship meetings, which were both won by Limavady. It is a derby game and with both teams outside the favourites for the title, the local bragging rights will be at stake and Limavady should come through.

In stepped John Heaney and Damien Hasson to help steer them clear of the drop zone. Heaney is back at the helm, with Paul McGowan, Dermot McNicholl and Anthony McNeill in the back-room team. They were hit by the blow of a second cruciate ligament injury for promising wing back Diarmuid McNicholl who starred against Coleraine in the  championship. Heaney confirmed Paddy Bradleysto the squad and he came off the bench against Ballinascreen at the weekend. He played a starring role in their win over Drumsurn last season and will need to balance his role as Loup manager with pushing for a place in the Glenullin attack, where his brother Eoin will be a pivotal figure. googletag.cmd.push Another addition has been former Dungiven player Gavin McLaughlin, who is married and living in Glenullin, but is balancing training with mid-week work commitments in Dublin. The Glen have brought through some young talent who have experience under their belts in the form of Feargal Close, Conor Rafferty, Donal and Daniel OKane. Heaney confirmed that goalkeeper Pierce McNicholl is struggling with a quad injury and. Neil McNicholl, who had opted out of the squad at the start of the year, has ed to training and may answer the call between the posts - following in the footsteps of older brother Eoin. googletag.cmd.push Eamon Gibson is back at the helm of the Brian Oacutegs and they finalised their plans with games against senior teams Foreglen and Newbridge at the weekend, excelling against the latter in a high-scoring encounter. Stephen Cleary is back in the fold after a y spell working away from home. His exploits almost sunk Castledawson on his own in the  final. He wont have played much since he left, but after featuring in both challenge games at the weekend his presence will be a welcome addition. His Derry minor colleagues from , Neil Forester and Mickey McKinney are still on board. In attack, Ben McCarron and Eoghan Bradley could operate as the perfect duo. The  title was the one that got away, as the Dawson somehow wrangled it away from their grasp in the closing stages. Eamon Gibson will be left pondering where Claudy progressed to after seeing the Oacutegs off in last seasons Round  replay. Both sides will have a say in the race for this seasons title, so there will be more questions than answers after Sunday.

In stepped John Heaney and Damien Hasson to help steer them clear of the drop zone. Heaney is back at the helm, with Paul McGowan, Dermot McNicholl and Anthony McNeill in the back-room team. They were hit by the blow of a second cruciate ligament injury for promising wing back Diarmuid McNicholl who starred against Coleraine in the  championship. Heaney confirmed Paddy Bradleysto the squad and he came off the bench against Ballinascreen at the weekend. He played a starring role in their win over Drumsurn last season and will need to balance his role as Loup manager with pushing for a place in the Glenullin attack, where his brother Eoin will be a pivotal figure. googletag.cmd.push Another addition has been former Dungiven player Gavin McLaughlin, who is married and living in Glenullin, but is balancing training with mid-week work commitments in Dublin. The Glen have brought through some young talent who have experience under their belts in the form of Feargal Close, Conor Rafferty, Donal and Daniel OKane. Heaney confirmed that goalkeeper Pierce McNicholl is struggling with a quad injury and. Neil McNicholl, who had opted out of the squad at the start of the year, has ed to training and may answer the call between the posts - following in the footsteps of older brother Eoin. googletag.cmd.push Eamon Gibson is back at the helm of the Brian Oacutegs and they finalised their plans with games against senior teams Foreglen and Newbridge at the weekend, excelling against the latter in a high-scoring encounter. Stephen Cleary is back in the fold after a y spell working away from home. His exploits almost sunk Castledawson on his own in the  final. He wont have played much since he left, but after featuring in both challenge games at the weekend his presence will be a welcome addition. His Derry minor colleagues from , Neil Forester and Mickey McKinney are still on board. In attack, Ben McCarron and Eoghan Bradley could operate as the perfect duo. The  title was the one that got away, as the Dawson somehow wrangled it away from their grasp in the closing stages. Eamon Gibson will be left pondering where Claudy progressed to after seeing the Oacutegs off in last seasons Round  replay. Both sides will have a say in the race for this seasons title, so there will be more questions than answers after Sunday.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Moville resident Enda Craig has urged local representatives to wake up and finally end all confusion over the Lough. Mr Craig made the comments following a motion at last weeks monthly meeting of Donegal County Council, where the issue of unregulated oyster fishing was raised. At the meeting in Letterkenny, local councillor Terry Crossan highlighted the environmental and visual impact an estimated , oyster trestles is having on the Lough. The Muff-based councillor asked council officials to contact the Marine Minister to engage with his British counterparts to seek to resolve the jurisdictional issues. googletag.cmd.push However Mr Craig stated that there are no jurisdictional issues between Britain and Ireland as the Crown Estate owns the seabed of Lough Foyle. The lough has been a disputed area between Britain and Ireland since the formation of the Irish Free State in . “You cant claim jurisdiction over something you dont own, its that simple,” he told the Inish Times. The Crown Estate is a collection of lands and holdings within the UK belonging to the British monarch as a corporation. Mr Craig said that the issue of jurisdiction has been settled and that local representatives should recognise that fact. googletag.cmd.push “I know that local representatives deal with numerous issues on a daily basis so they may not understand fully that Ireland has no jurisdiction over the lough at all, but it is time that they waken up and stop claiming jurisdiction over something that they dont own.” He also highlighted the feeling of unequal treatment that traditional oyster fishermen have received over the ongoing unregulated farms dotted along the Lough Foyle coast. “The traditional wild oyster fishermen look on as oysters are being harvested in large numbers on trestles on the shoreline of Lough Foyle by fishermen who are not burdened with a licence fee.” He added: “Any attempt to resolve the issue of licensing on the sea-bed of Lough Foyle without firstly taking into account its ownership by the Crown Estates is putting the cart before the horse and is doomed to failure.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The conservation charity uses transects to investigate changes in habitats rather than to simply estimate the number of organisms within it. Pam Hardeman, who volunteers for The Woodland Trust, has been leading the butterfly transects for over a year. Pam’s recent survey was met with much excitement in the Woodland Trust Northern Ireland team as she found the elusive butterfly, the purple hairstreak, and was able to record its sighting. Pam, who found the rare butterfly right at the end of her weekly survey, said: “I was over the moon to find a purple hairstreak. googletag.cmd.push I was actually photographing a speckled wood that had landed close by when it flew in and landed on a bramble leaf. It was quite a breezy but sunny afternoon so perhaps it was sheltering!

Mid Ulster Christian Helpline is listed in the Councils directory as a prayer line and last month distributed literature in the Magherafelt area branding homosexuality detestable onto God. The leaflet also called on those who participate in such immorality to repent and turn from their evil ways and included contact details for people to get in touch. Independent councillors Dan Kerr and Barry Monteith have also written to council management to ask that the listing be removed because it may promote conversion therapy. googletag.cmd.push The incident is under investigation by the PSNI. A spokesperson for the council said the directory listings had been temporarily removed. The online directory offers local business and services a listing opportunity and any inclusion should not be considered as an endorsement by the Council for any goods or services provided by any organisation, they said. However, given the issue which has now arisen, the directory section where community and voluntary organisations have registered their details, has been temporarily removed to allow us to undertake a review of the provision of the service in line with our equality commitments, and to take advice as required. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last weekend, Devines  European Rally Championship campaign got off to a frustrating start with an early retirement from Rally di Roma Capitale. Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy had shown promise early on with eighth fastest time in Friday qualying as well as being the quickest Hyundai i R, outpacing works Hyundai driver Craig Breen and fellow Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing Junior Driver Greacutegoire Munster. On Saturday morning, Devine was running on the fringes of the top  and despite not being fully committed to his pacenotes, was outpacing Hyundai Rally Team Italia driver, and former Italian Champion, Umberto Scandola. googletag.cmd.push “We were slightly disappointed with our start and knew we had much more in us”, said Callum after the event. “We were just starting to get into a flow on stage three and building up speed. To try and be on the pace on these events you have to cut where you can and carry as much speed as possible. There was a fast corner through a dip which we cut and there was a bang as we went over some stones. We didn’t think much of it as it’s not unusual to hear noises like that while cutting a corner. But slowly the engine began to lose oil and then the oil pressure light came on  metres from the finish of the stage, he added. googletag.cmd.push We stopped the engine and coasted over the finish but that was game over. It turned out that in the compression a stone punched through the sumpguard and holed the sump, causing the engine to lose all its oil. I could probably take that corner  times and it would never happen again, it was just a freak thing but when you’re trying that card is always in the deck I suppose. I’m really disappointed for the whole team after all the effort that went into the weekend, I know we would have been in contention for a decent result.” His next European Rally Championship event in Latvia in mid-August and Devine has another chance to show his speed on Italian tarmac this weekend at Rally di Alba, where he joins Kilreas Josh McErlean, the current Young Irish Driver of the Year. Rally di Alba will take place on Sunday, August  with the crews taking on three stages repeated three times with the total competitive mileage of the event coming in at just over km. Following the event Callum and Brian willhome to prepare for Rally Liepāja, the second round of the ERC. “Latvia is a loose surface event andthe year had gone to plan, I would have liked a little more loose surface experience in the Hyundai before this stage of the year but it is what it is”, added Devine. “After a non-score in Rome and the championship having less rounds this year, we’ll need to take points away from Latvia.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Just nine days after this birthday, McErlean travelled to Italy last weekend for the European Championships to support Callum Devine, who will also race in Sundays event, and get his bearings ahead of this weekends action. Last year McErlean won the British Championship and picked up the Billy Coleman award for Irish Young Driver of the Year “This years British Championship was cancelled in June, so our plans were dashed and we had to come up with a plan B,” Josh told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push In stepped Hyundai and the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy to give him the opportunity in an event with a signicant Hyundai over it. “There are  other Hyundai R cars going, so there is a lot of competition, but it is great to get it,” add McErlean, who will be driving the same car used by Callum Devine in Rally Rome at the weekend. “It is great for the both of us winning the Billy Coleman award, from the same area and it shows you how far you can go with the backing of the Academy.” McErlean will again have the support of co-driver Keaton Williams and Junior British Rally Champion will take on one of the biggest challenges of his career so far, across nine stages on the roads of South West Italy. googletag.cmd.push Rally di Alba begins on Saturday with pre-event reconnaissance and a short shakedown stage near San Martino. The following day, nine stages lie ahead, three repeated, totalling just over  kilometres of special stage action before ing to Alba for the finish ceremony. “It will be a big step up from what I am used to,” Josh admits of this weekends Italian date. “It is something I am not that familiar with and it will be great to see what it is all about. “Callum is a good benchmark, he is from here but he has a few more years experience than me...it will be good to judge my pace off. If I can get close to his times, but we will have to build our pace throughout the rally and see how it goes.” McErlean was only able to complete one round of the series, thanks to the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic which halted motorsport across the UK and Ireland. “It gave me the opportunity to look at things in more detail and see what I would improve on, so maybe it was a good thing,” Josh pointed out. In Decemberraced in Italy, but in a dferent discipline at the Monza Rally Show. “There is some dference in racing around a track and going up a mountain road, but at least it gave me the experience of travelling the country,” McErlean pointed out. This time it is going to dferent. As well as Devine, World Rally Championship stars Ott Taumlnak and Thierry Neuville will be tough nuts to crack. “Im delighted to be able to get back to rallying again and this is such an amazing opportunity for me to be heading to Italy in the Hyundai i R” he added. Tuesday is a day of testing, before a day or recce on Friday to suss out the course for Saturdays shakedown. “Then we have the rally on Sunday, so it is a good format,” Josh feels. “A podium place would be a dream,” he adds, but is realistic. “There is a big entry list, there are three World Rally Drivers doing it so it is nearly a World Championship level event. “Monza aside, I have limited asphalt experience of the Hyundai, so I really need to be realistic about my expectations on a result. The focus is to get back into the groove again, six months out of the car is certainly not ideal but it will be pretty much the same for everyone. “I realise that gaining European experience is unbelievably valuable so we will have a clear goal on the pace we want to be at and try to stick at it throughout the day. It is a real honour to be competing out there and Im very thankful for the amazing support around us”. Andrew Johns, Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing Operations Leader, is hopeful for McErlean. “The opportunity for Josh to run at the Rally di Alba gives him a chance to compete against some of the best drivers in Europe, while continuing to develop his career and gain crucial mileage on tarmac stages,” John stated. “He will able to call on support from our customer support engineers at the rally, and hopefully come away with a good result and some valuable experience.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The figure was outlined in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the local harbour.While the key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, they also examined improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.The consultants also undertook a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas, including the fish dock within the southpier. In August last year, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group set up to oversee the regeneration of the port.Cllr Curran says there are plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He said consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall and gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a key part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Couple who met at school enjoy 50th wedding anniversary  ","story":"A LOCAL couple who met at school and whose love grew at a church youth group have recently celebrated th years of marriage.Jim and Angela Wilson marked their golden anniversary with a family party with their three sons and their wives and nine grandchildren.The Saintfield couple, who now live in Comber, married on July ,  at Saintfield Parish Church and honeymooned, like many others of their generation, at home.Angela was just  and Jim  when they got married but despite their tender years starting off married le, the happy couple wouldnrsquot turn the clock back.Retired motor mechanic Jim said: ldquoWe met at Saintfield High School and used to go the local youth club, I was in the BB and Angela was in the GB.

Wersquore very lucky to have it and should make every effort to keep it going.Another resident described confirmation that the facility will not reopen this summer as ldquosuch a shame.She added: ldquoAs the only al open air sea pool left in Northern Ireland the Rock Pool ought to be celebrated and included in Discover Northern Irelandrsquos tourism landmark buildings and locations information.

I was either three or four. My brother Garrett is a year younger than me. We moved from Strangford to Downpatrick when I was four-and-a-half and it was before that.My father had taken the two of us to watch a football match. Other than my mother, perhaps his five favourite things in le were reading, the crossword, conversation, a cup of tea and watching a game.What he wasnrsquot always great at was keeping a close eye on children in his charge. Between watching his old club play and chatting to a couple of the other men on the sideline, he didnrsquot notice Garrett and I making a sprint on to the pitch, looking for a go with the ball.It could well be that memory through the efflux of time has us causing greater disruption that night than actually was the case. In some ways I hope that our presence wasnrsquot even noticed by the players. It would be awful were that to have been the biggest influence that I ever had on a football match, although there is every chance that my high point was that warm evening in Kilclief.Unfortunately my enthusiasm for sport was not matched by aptitude. On one visit to his cousins in Listowel I was being encouraged to eat up my black pudding with the Kerry exhortation that I wouldnrsquot play football for Down without a good diet of black pudding.If only it had been that easy. The biggest problem was an unreliability and inconsistency in a ballrsquos direction of flight after it had been propelled by my foot, hand or implement. Allied to being short-sighted before my teens and having a slight frame, the portents werenrsquot good.Football was the game in the Red High and there were plenty of good footballers about. Kevan Owens, Ciaran McCabe and Patrick Kielty were in my year. Brian Burns the year behind. John Kielty the year ahead with Conor Deegan, Barry Breen, Mark McCartan and John Kelly a few years ahead.The recently-deceased Bro Charles was teaching in the school until my fourth year and every day hersquod put out a tea chest of hurleys for a lunchtime puck-about, which I often took advantage of. Bro Charles also coached a Downpatrick team and under his patient tutelage, and presumably need for numbers, I reached my sporting apogee with an East Down U-frac medal.What I did get from my father was the love of watching sport and going to matches. He brought me to Croke Park for the first time when I was six. It was the  football final. I was mesmerised by the colour and the noise. I know that Dublin beat Armagh that day but I honestly donrsquot remember that.What I do remember is that, for my only time, our seats were in the Ard Comhairle box. And they were soft seats. And I remember Down winning the minor match and them being given a big silver cup and I remember Daddy holding me up in his arms so that I could see it and it being so close that I tried to reach out and touch it.But it wasnrsquot all glamour. I still have yet to feel as baltic as I did one winter Sunday standing on a grass bank in the Marshes at about the age of eight or nine with the cold spreading from the frozen turf through the soles of my shoes and up my legs and Daddy talking and talking and talking as I futilely tried to will him back to the car and the warmth of home.Happier times included a spring and summer of going to watch club hurling matches. He was a member, along with Paddy OrsquoDonoghue I think, of a commission on the future of hurling in Down for the County Board and there were many trips to games, particularly to the Ards.As much as he loved football, in truth hurling was his real passion. Due maybe to a Waterford father. As a young man he had hurled for Kilclief and the county. Nothing better than a good game of hurling, hersquod say. Particularly one played in fair conditions on a firm pitch. He never got to the Munster final as often as he would have liked, but that was considered one of the great highlights of any sporting year.What we did get to and what from a young age what I was lucky enough to have as a highlight were the September trips to Croke Park for the hurling and football finals. Particularly the football finals. I got to see the great Kerry-Dublin battles, Kerryrsquos four-in-a-row, Kerryrsquos three-in-a-row.With a Kerry grandmother I felt some affinity to that great team. The Spillanes, Jack OrsquoShea, Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute, Mikey Sheehy, Bomber Liston, Ogie Moran, Charlie Nelligan. Great men. As magnicent as the modern Croke Park is, part of me will always miss the old wooden benches of the Hogan Stand.But there were green shoots beginning to appear with Downrsquos Minor All-Ireland in  followed by a narrow loss to Meath, my county of residence these last  years and more, in the  National League final. Preludes of course to theof the good old days and Downrsquos second era of greatness.I have never been at a more momentous sporting occasion than the  final.  comes close obviously, but doesnrsquot match it for the sheer joy, relief and euphoria.That match in Celtic Park is another contender. I suspect that had I been in Istanbul in  it might also have come close. I was in Cardf when Leinster came back from the dead with  unanswered second half points to win their second Heineken Cup. That too was an extraordinary day. But rsquo was in a league of its own.Those men of Kerry were heroes. But heroes in the same way as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and John Barnes were heroes. Itrsquos a very dferent thing when the heroes are your own people. The excitement building for weeks before. My father calling in favours from all over the country to secure extra tickets. He could nearly have opened a ticket agency.My seat that day was near the back of the Upper Cusack, two seats along from Paddy Doherty. Afterwards we made our way across the pitch and out on to Jonesrsquos Road to meet up with everyone  for the chat. At some ungodly hour on the Monday night the bus finally arrived into Downpatrick and the great Pete McGrath said that we beat the team that couldnrsquot be beaten.The last time that I went to Croke Park with my father was his last visit, three-and-a-half months before he died. It was the hurling final between his fatherrsquos county of Waterford and Galway.He had been there in  and  when they had won their two All-Irelands. He had spent childhood holidays with cousins near Dungarvan, which is where he had learnt to speak Irish. In  he had a lt by horse and cart into Tramore for the train to Dublin to watch the match.His lungs werenrsquot great at that point and I think he had greater clarity than the rest of us about how long was left. He had said to me one evening in France the month before, ldquoYou know that this is going to do for me. I knew it was, but I thought there was still a good bit leftto go.It was  years since he had brought me that first time to Croke Park when we saw Down win an All-Ireland. It would have been nice symmetry had Waterford won on his last visit but it wasnrsquot to be. The day still finished with him standing chatting to friends on Jonesrsquos Road for as long as he was able. I was happy to have been with him on that last trip.At some point in the lsquos my father stopped driving. He was probably happier with the greater opportunity for the crossword or the newspaper. My mother drove him about, but often therersquod be a lt to a match, usually with Joe Leonard. I think he went to more matches with Joe in his last couple of decades than with everyone  combined.We had started going on holidays to France in the lsquos and by the mid lsquos, by which time he had retired as Ombudsman , he and my mother were spending most of the summer there. They loved itbut,there was one downside, he missed a lot of football and hurling.Initially he relied on match reports by telephone from any of us still in Ireland. The urgency of the reports eased as his access to the internet grew but he still appreciated a call at some point to be told how the match had actually gone.The real salvation though was when their great friends, the McQuaids from Dungannon, started to come on holidays to the next town. That in itself was a good thing, but the real boon was Jimrsquos technical wizardry and ability to use a satellite dish to get RTEacute. Thereafter Jim and Maurice spent many Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons watching Jimrsquos television.I donrsquot know when I first knew of the great feats of the lsquos. I donrsquot ever remember not knowing. Whether it was the flag that my mother kept in the house with ldquoUp Down stitched across it that she had made for one of her brothers in  that my brothers and I loved to take out and wave in the garden.Or my fatherrsquos watch that had been given to him by Brian McCartan and Charlie Carr, which was engraved ldquoTo Maurice Hayes, Secretary of the Down All Ireland Football Team . From B. and C., which fascinated us as children. A watch he wore for the rest of his le and which I am wearing now as I write this.That watch made it clear that this had been something of very great import. I often think of James McCartanrsquos story of meeting his father on Jonesrsquos Road after the  final. His father was in floods of tears and said to him, ldquoYou kept your promise.The names were as familiar as our own. The McCartans and the OrsquoNeills. Paddy Doherty, Joe Lennon, Kevin Mussen, Jarlath Carey, Leo Murphy, Eddie McKay, Tony Hadden, George Lavery, Breen Morgan, Pat Rice, Patsy OrsquoHagan, PJ McElroy, John Smith and Kieran Denvir along with names like John Murphy, Peter Rooney, Larry Powell, Danny Kelly, Ray McConville, Jim Milligan and the great Colm McAlarney from later in the decade.As a boy, when people heard that I was a Hayes, Irsquod at times be askedI was Mauricersquos son and then told that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland but for him. And when Irsquod ask him about it hersquod say that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland without the players, that hersquod never kicked a ball.He spent the best part of six decades holding those men in the highest esteem, as footballers, as people, and as friends. His view was that every one of them had lived constructive lives in which they had contributed to their families, their communities and to society.And for all their achievements, they were modest men. Paddy Doherty recently selected his best Down team of all time for the Down Recorder. He didnrsquot pick himself. Paddy lsquoMorsquo is the only person in the entire country that wouldnrsquot have Paddy lsquoMorsquo on that team.Above all, he loved their company. He loved meeting up with them over the years at matches and ious s. Usually wearing his Club Down tie. Part of the pleasure of going to a match was the half-time cup of tea and the chat with friends afterwards, whether on Jonesrsquos Road, in Newry or whatever ground the match was in.There are two photographs from the GAA Congress in Newcastle ten years ago that show it well. One is a formal photograph with President McAleese and ious dignitaries. Hersquos sitting at the bottom left deep in conversation with Kevin Mussen.In the other, therersquos a group standing on a set of steps. Hersquos at the back having a chat with James McCartan. I think that Bobbie Hanvey was one of the only people that could get him to look into a camera.A third photograph from that Congress showed him standing in front of the huge poster of the  team calling them ldquoThe History Makers. That photograph was used on his memorial card. When it came to his funeral, he was buried in his Club Down tie. Nothing  would have been appropriate.His last visitor before he died was Dr Walsh, who held his hand and chatted to him. Their last words together were, ldquoWe had good times. They certainly did.This article was originally published on the Club Down website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11385995.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

At five miles long, it is a fraction of the proposed -mile NI-Scotland bridge but there are such bridges, including Hong Kong-Zhuhai-MacauBack in  the notion of a bridge was used as satire to lampoon then Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger over the failure of the Union Bill. Pitt, of course, had the last laugh with the passage into law the following year of the Act of Union.Almost a century passed before formal plans for such bridges came into being.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Shane Greer, who describes himself as an entrepreneur, investor and political commentator, is originally from Northern Ireland, now living in Washington DC. © Jessica YurinkoAt least five dferent potential routes have been proposed, debated, rejected, or otherwise left to wither on the vine since then. But just as technological progress advances endlessly to make the once fantastical seem achievable, so too do the impediments to such a bridge recede in the face of that progress.Nevertheless, mockery of the very idea of a physical transport connection between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is indulged with every bit as much enthusiasm as those anti-Union publishers who set their sights on Pitt. And like those publishers, their modern-day contemporaries remind us that the act of mocking is much easier than the act of manesting that which they mock. In Pitt’s case, the Union, in our case a bridge. Yes, there are impediments. Some even verge on the comical, like reckoning with the million-plus tonnes of conventional and chemical weapons dumped in a submarine trench, Beaufort’s Dyke, last century. One can almost imagine the originator of the weapons dumping scheme having one final meeting in a windowless Whitehall conference room before giving the green light. “Anyone foresee any potential problems with dumping all these munitions in the Irish Sea  Jenkins ” “None sir. Seems like a spfing idea.”But let’s dispense with easy mockery and instead engage in thoughtful discussion. First, those with expertise in this area, like Wanda Lewis, Emeritus Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Warwick, do not see even such issues as the presence of wartime munitions in Beaufort’s Dyke as a factor rendering a bridge impossible. She contends that it’s more a question of whether the cost of crossing the Dyke would render other bridge routes more cost-effective. In other words, yes there are signicant challenges, but we have the capability and the capacity to study them, work out the cost of overcoming them, and reach evidence-based decisions on viability.Second, we need only look around us to witness marvels of infrastructure that stand as a testament to our remarkable ability to overcome astonishing engineering challenges. Relatively close to home, there’s the Öresund Bridge connecting Sweden and Denmark. Proposals for a tunnel or bridge crossing the Öresund strait date back almost as far as those for a bridge between Great Britain and Ireland. Twenty years on from Öresund’s completion, we are reminded of our capacity to surmount the once insurmountable.Before anyone retorts that the Öresund Bridge spans a mere fraction of the distance the Irish Sea bridge would be required to cross, I would direct their attention to the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge, which at around  miles is about the distance as the crow flies between Belfast and Cookstown. Distance, like depth and other environmental conditions, are just challenges to be met and overcome.Thirdly, let us remember how transformative it is to be able to get easily from one place to another. Just as it is easy to forget how the ready availability of light at the flick of a switch has transformed human le, so too do we forget how dferent our lives would be without the M, A, or the Ballywhatever Road you take to get the groceries, visit family or commute to work. Gray and black roads like these are the arteries through which our lives flow. Casting all  aside, just consider how remarkable it would be to get into your car and drive to Glasgow, Manchester or London.Fourthly, and perhaps most important of all, we need to dispense with that most tiresome of character traits, the desire to shoot others down and shoot their ideas down. Seats in the peanut gallery are cheap, but they add nothing but distraction to actual events being played out on the stage. It is a tiresome trait that holds Northern Ireland back in so many ways. The notion that that will never work, that engaging in a new venture is too risky, that things are the way they are for a reason, that you should not rock the boat, are not worthy of a people whose capacity to overcome adversity is legend. So let’s dispense with the lazy criticism and support a proper feasibility study. Let facts lead the decision-making process, not untested aspersions. None of this is to say that a bridge to Scotland is an infrastructure proposal of singular importance. As Ben Lowry pointed on these pages last week ‘The Boris bridge to Scotland plan is a nice dream but a distant one and a distraction from other priorities for unionism and infrastructure,’ see link below,a bridge is to be built it will be decades before the first vehicle travels across it. Instead, it must be viewed as one substantial piece of a much more ambitious project to improve connectivity within and without Northern Ireland. With that in mind, and as Robert Park argued here yesterday ‘A bridge to Scotland is not just a unionist umbilical project, but a strategic bridge to Europe and to the world,’ see link below, a bridge shouldn’t be thought of as a “‘unionist umbilical’ project,” but as part of a “massive, strategic investment that willsecurity to us on energy, connectivity, water and jobs.”As a people who have spent decades now building metaphorical bridges between erstwhile detached communities in Northern Ireland, we can do better than trying without empirical merit to prevent the construction of physical ones. • Shane Greer is an entrepreneur, investor and political commentator based in Washington DC• Ben Lowry: ‘The Boris bridge to Scotland plan is a nice dream but a distant one and a distraction from other priorities for unionism and infrastructure’• Robert Park: ‘A bridge to Scotland is not just a unionist umbilical project, but a strategic bridge to Europe and to the world’——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The final times are published on the Belfast City Marathon website.For Clodagh, the virtual marathon was much more of a journey, after she suffered a devastating stroke in .She was left trapped inside her own body as a result but has battled against all the odds toto mobility and has even written an emotionally charged book on her experiences - entitled ‘A Return to Duty’.The profoundly moving memoir tells the remarkable story of a fighting-fit policewoman from Magherafelt, who was left paralysed and spent three months locked in her body following a devastating stroke.Clodagh’s le took a dramatic turn when, at the age of , she had a brainstem stroke which left her fully conscious but unable to communicate, apart from blinking. She had locked in syndrome, which affects around one per cent of people who have a stroke.It is a condition for which there is no treatment or cure, and it is extremely rare for patients to recover any signicant motor s.

I want the world to know the reality of the struggle when you lose the ability to communicate.“Locked in syndrome is a truly horrying ordeal and I was convinced many times that I was going to die in hospital because I couldn’t communicate the fact that I was overheating or in pain.“It was only because my partner Adrian noticed I could blink that we were able to work out a way of communicating until I could learn to make a sound again.”Clodagh added: “Writing the book made me laugh and cry as I relived the experience and I will be delightedthis book can help anyone who has a friend or family member going through a similar situation to understand what is happening.“I know how fortunate I am to enjoy the quality of le that I do, because I know this is not the case for many survivors of locked in syndrome, and that is thanks to Adrian and my family and the dedication of the healthcare workers who helped me learn to breathe, talk and walk again.”She added: “I know I’ll never be % back to full fitness but I am determined to be the best version of me I can be.”A Return to Duty is available to buy at beatinglockedin Kathryn Holland, outdoor events manager, Cancer Focus NI, said: “We are so delighted that Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon chose us as their official charity partner.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Box Two is to recycle foil paper and boxes, food and drinks cans, aerosols and cartons such as milk containers and plastics also. Box Three is for cardboard, glass bottles and jars.Bryson Recycling saysadopted it could mean a jobs boost for the area as well as making recycling easier. The firm already has a link with the council, collecting recycling from homes in the Armagh area.Eric Randall, Director at Bryson Recycling says: “We are delighted that the Council is considering the Wheelie Box option. Collected weekly, the latest Wheelie Box model will offer % more capacity than a standard green recycling bin.This is an image of what can be put in the Wheelie Boxes.“Wheelie Boxes are a very much enhanced version of the kerbside boxes which are already in use in the Armagh area. The boxes have a lockable hinged lid and are integrated onto a trolley with wheels, which makes them secure and very easy to use and move.“As well as providing more space for recycling, Wheelie Boxes will also mean good news for local jobs because % of what we collect using this approach is recycled in Northern Ireland. This compares to typically around % using green bins.”Wheelie Boxes are not new, , households in Northern Ireland already use them.Bryson Recycling also pointed out that two firms based in the borough, Huhtamaki and Cherry Pipes, used recyclable materials.A number of dferent systems are currently in operation across the Borough and the consultation aims to introduce a single, streamlined recycling system from next year.Eric adds: “The Wheelie Box option means local households can increase the amount they recycle every week instead of fortnightly, protect local jobs, boost the economy and play an important role in creating a local, sustainable environment for all.”To voice your opinion, check out the link on the ABC Council website here https:www.armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk green-bin-or-wheelie-box-choose-which-to-use "},{"url":null,"title":"autumn date set opening new south lake leisure centre ","story":"Manwho died suddenly on Sunday was father of a little girl‘He wore his great big heart openly on his sleeve’ mourners told at funeral of ‘legend’ Gary McConaghyNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleAutumn date set for opening of new South Lake Leisure CentreA date has been set for the opening of the new south lake leisure centre in Craigavon with the multi-million-pound facility to open its doors on November .By The NewsroomTuesday, th July , : pmUpdated Tuesday, th July , : pm\"\"The largest capital project to date undertaken by ABC Council, and among the largest in Northern Ireland, the new multi-use sports and leisure complex is described by the council as a major new flagship health and wellbeing destination.Work on the facility was halted by the coronavirus outbreak.
