First, nation states are far more effective in a crisis than unwieldy groupings of different countries.But the most bitter irony for Europe is that the one foreign politician our liberal commentariat have most mocked for years — Boris Johnson — is also the one who acted swiftly and decisively when it came to securing the vaccines.

citing safeguarding issues and staffing constraints.In contrast, others live-stream what is happening in the classroom with the children of keyworkers, including some interaction for youngsters at home.Others have a structured timetable and live lessons as well as pre-recorded video clips in between.A number of schools are reporting a higher turnout of eligible pupils on site - including children of critical workers and those classed as vulnerable - than in the March lockdown, prompting concerns about their ability to balance remote education with in-person teaching.It came as Education Secretary Gavin Williamson set out his expectations for schools during the latest lockdown.He said parents can contact Ofsted if they are unhappy with the offer and have previously raised concerns with their headteacher.Ms Longfield said: \u0027Every child has the right to a good education and it is not acceptable that some children are unable to learn, through no fault of their own, because of a lack of technology, or because their home circumstances prevent them being able to work effectively.\u0027There are also clearly disparities between what schools are offering children in terms of remote lessons.\u0027I want the Government to commit to ensuring that all children have access to technical equipment and broadband to support remote learning, alongside an urgent review of guidance for schools to ensure make sure that children receive a broad and balanced curriculum, whether at home or at school.\u0027As a minimum, those children learning remotely should have daily contact with teachers.\u0027We know the negative impact the last long lockdown had on the wellbeing of many children and I want to see a speeding-up of the process of introducing mental health support and counselling in every school.\u0027Mr Williamson told the House of Commons on Wednesday that the schools watchdog will enforce legal requirements for state schools in England to provide high-quality remote education during the lockdown.He said schools are expected to provide between three and five hours of teaching a day - and if parents feel their child is not receiving enough learning they should complain to the school first and then ultimately to Ofsted.The Department for Education said it expects schools to have a digital platform, such as G-Suite or Microsoft Education, and to provide at least some of their remote teaching via video lessons - this can be done by school-led videos or using other providers like Oak National Academy.Mr Williamson confirmed that children who do not have access to technology are seen as vulnerable and can attend school in person during the national lockdown.One thread on the Mumsnet website showed that parents are concerned about the disparities in learning.\u0027I\u0027m concerned about DD falling behind compared to the keyworker children in her class who are being taught by the teacher,\u0027 one parent wrote.Another said: \u0027There seems to be big disparities in what the offers are.\u0027One parent said they felt \u0027so disheartened\u0027 with the offer from their school, writing: \u0027I have a Year 6 who\u0027s had a maths worksheet and two bite-size clips to watch today.\u0027It\u0027s the same provision as the last lockdown.\u0027I\u0027m so disappointed I thought it would be better this time round.\u0027Then I read on here about other primary age children having live lessons and a more structured timetable and it makes me so disheartened.\u0027Another said: \u0027My Year 5 son is getting three 30-45 minute live lessons per day (his teacher working from home, with his children at home) plus the accompanying work, plus reading.\u0027And one parent said: \u0027Unfortunately we are just getting worksheets and links to bite-size.\u0027MailOnline reported on Tuesday how experts have warned of serious problems developing as England enters its third national lockdown, with one declaring \u0027The pandemic has created a mental health ticking time bomb\u0027.Draconian measures designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus variant will heavily impact many during the gruelling winter months.Depression, anxiety and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder are expected as the restrictions create a sense of terrible Deja Vu.The blow comes especially hard due to the proximity of New Year, where many had believed the start of 2021 would signal more optimistic fortunes.Michael Gove said the curbs on freedom would last for months, triggering more gloom among the public. And children - after being told schools would be safe - face difficult home-learning after the U-turn by Boris Johnson and his government.During his coronavirus news briefing today, the Prime Minister said approximately £12billion had been spent on NHS mental health care, with around another £19-20million contributed towards mental health charities.Emma Thomas, Chief Executive at YoungMinds told MailOnline: \u0027The pandemic is deepening the crisis in young people\u0027s mental health and there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the impact could be significant and long-term.\u0027Young people tell us that they\u0027ve struggled to cope with the changes and loss of coping mechanisms brought on by the pandemic, with many experiencing social isolation, anxiety, and fears around their future.\u0027Many lost access to mental health support during the first lockdown, while others chose not to look for help at a time when the NHS was under so much pressure. With the pandemic continuing through the winter and another lockdown confirmed, it\u0027s likely that more young people may struggle to cope.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4153e59c5e62286db8f9c67afcdd7ae2c177e641/0_0_2500_1667/master/2500.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b4903de82e9ed2de55c4951f395636cb 1440w","title":"great walls of china beijings burgeoning graffiti scene in pictures","story":"A thriving graffiti culture has been brewing for decades in Beijing, featuring Chinese characters, animals of the zodiac ... and complaints about the price of pork "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdc08ef663e9cc44b08e5abf7c52cfe97a7e2ca0/0_95_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=cd540244b640a7029c6d995cfa447cbb","title":"national express to suspend all uk services from monday covid","story":"Coach operator to halt all journeys until March as a result of tighter Covid restrictionsNational Express is to suspend its entire network of coach services across the UK from Monday due to the latest Covid-19 travel restrictions.The company, a major provider of timetabled coach routes, said it would be halting all services until March.Chris Hardy, the managing director of National Express UK Coach, said: “We have been providing an important service for essential travel needs.

Or so it might initially appear from recent comments made by Wonder Woman 1984’s Patty Jenkins on Marc Maron’s WTF podcast, which have subsequently been picked up by media outlets across the globe.Discussing Gal Gadot’s first turn as the Amazonian superhero in 2017’s widely-acclaimed Wonder Woman, Jenkins revealed she initially battled the studio to get her vision of a warm-hearted, loving Diana of Themyscira across, ultimately winning out over an approach that would have seen the character engaging in extreme ultraviolence.“I felt like they wanted to hire me like a beard they wanted me to walk around on set being a female director – but it was their story and their vision,” said Jenkins of her first experiences with the studio.“Even when I first joined Wonder Woman it was like, ‘Uhh, yeah, OK, but let’s do it this other way.’ But I was like, ‘Women don’t want to see that. Her being harsh and tough and cutting people’s heads off … I’m a Wonder Woman fan, that’s not what we’re looking for.’ Still, I could feel that shaky nervousness of my point of view.”Jenkins has since taken to Twitter to point out that she was rarely “at war” with Warner Bros and was discussing conversations that took place over a decade ago, (presumably) with very different executives to those who eventually greenlit Wonder Woman. The Monster film-maker first began talks on taking on a Wonder Woman moviein 2007, but it wasn’t until the best part of a decade later that she was invited to finally make the film with full creative freedom. That makes sense when you watch the 2017 movie, which feels like an entirely different beast to other episodes in the early DC “extended universe” such as the dark and knuckle-headed Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice.Even the later Justice League, a lighter-toned affair clearly influenced by the success of Wonder Woman, didn’t depict Gadot’s battling Amazon the way Jenkins would have. The film-maker told Yahoo recently that she was “uncomfortable with who she was and how she was seen”, after director Joss Whedon oversaw scenes in which the superhero is over-sexualised compared with her appearances in other movies.All of which brings us to Wonder Woman 1984, a so-so affair that, while entertaining enough for hardcore fans, seems to have fallen into the typical superhero sequel trap that previously affected Marvel’s Iron Man 2 and Thor: The Dark World. Here is a movie where Jenkins clearly had full creative control following its predecessor’s impressive box office take and almost universal critical acclaim. So why has it left such a sense of “meh?”The set-piece sequences are spectacular – in particular, Jenkins’ bravura opening vision of a cross-Themyscira athletics marathon that makes the modern Olympics look like a toddler’s egg and spoon race. The Mandalorian’s Pedro Pascal brings an unusual blend of humanity and furniture-chewing bad guy brio to the role of villain Maxwell Lord, Gadot is as splendidly statuesque as ever in the lead role, and her fish-out-of-water badinage with Chris Pine’s miraculously revived Steve Trevor is a thing of joy.The sequel also cleaves closely to Wonder Woman’s essential mantras, her powerful, independent femininity, kindness and grace. It does not pull its punches when depicting masculinity at its most toxic, yet utterly avoids any descent into myopic misandry. These are nuances to treasure.So what’s not to like? Perhaps the only criticism that can be levelled at Jenkins is that there is little new other than the 80s-setting and a freaky new MacGuffin to the essential makeup of Wonder Woman 1984. One can’t help feeling that if this had been a Marvel movie, there would have been scope to introduce other superheroes to lighten the load on the other princess Diana.And yet Jenkins has always preferred the standalone approach. Ultimately the film-maker got to make the Wonder Woman movie she wanted to make, without any studio interference – again, a rare achievement in Hollywood. It’s just a pity she didn’t – quite – manage to pull off the same trick twice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c681daa5c85888ede9e24f9db0193c682f2da9ad/1194_1262_5359_3214/master/5359.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5b951cca698ef48d8d9ba4996dd601f5","title":"mikel arteta expects mesut ozil future to be decided in next few days arsenal","story":"Arsenal have taken out a £120m loan from the Bank of England in an effort to ease cashflow issues that have mounted during the Covid-19 pandemic.The loan, which must be paid back by the end of May along with an undisclosed sum of interest, is designed to cover losses and will not have any impact on Mikel Arteta’s winter transfer plans. It has been provided by the bank’s Covid corporate financing facility, which assists organisations that meet highly specific investment criteria and are deemed to make significant contributions to the economy. Tottenham Hotspur and the Football Association are the only other football institutions to have made use of the scheme.Arsenal’s matchday income, in particular, has taken a huge hit during the pandemic. In 2018-19 it constituted a quarter of their revenue, a proportion unmatched across the top flight, and amounted to about £96m. The return of 2,000 supporters for recent games against Rapid Vienna and Burnley was scant compensation.Research from the Arsenal Supporters’ Trust last April projected the club could lose £144m over the subsequent 12 months if fans remained absent, and commercial revenue streams are also expected to have taken a hit without a pre-season tour. Although the short-term nature of the bank’s loan may raise eyebrows, the club expect no issues paying it back.The owner, Kroenke Sports \u0026amp Entertainment, has played a part in shoring up the club’s finances by providing a loan in July that redeemed the fixed-rate bonds issued when building the Emirates Stadium.It comes as a welcome boost at a time when Arsenal are looking to rid themselves of financial millstones. One of them, the exiled playmaker Mesut Özil, will see his future decided “in the next few days”, according to Mikel Arteta, although the Arsenal manager admits he does not know how or when the saga around him will end.There is little doubt Özil, whose contract expires in the summer, has played his final game for the club and all parties are keen to move on from a soured relationship that has cast an expensive shadow. Özil has been linked with Fenerbahce and DC United in this transfer window although his agent, Erkut Sogut, said on Wednesday that the player’s “priority is to stay” until the end of the season.“I’m saying we will decide what’s happening in the next few days,” Arteta said when asked whether Özil could remain at the club. “I don’t know what is going to happen. Obviously now he’s free to negotiate with other clubs. We will discuss internally what the best solution for him is for the near future, obviously with the player and agent too, and try to find the best solution for everyone.”The logistics around Özil departing this month are likely to be complicated given none of his suitors would be able to match his £350,000 weekly wage. A simpler option might be for the former Germany international to commit to moving after his deal ends, but that would mean Arsenal have to retain a player omitted from Arteta’s Premier League and Europa League squads in October.“If something was sorted this month, it’s because it is good for both parties, it is good for Mesut and his future, and it’s good for the club,” Arteta said. “If that’s the case, we will move forward. If it’s not the case, the player will stay here.”Özil is available for the FA Cup third-round tie with Newcastle on Saturday, although his involvement seems unthinkable. Thomas Partey could return from the thigh injury that has kept him out for all bar 45 minutes of the past two months’ action, although Arteta suggested he could be kept fresh for the Premier League meeting with Crystal Palace on Thursday.Whereas Özil’s fate is a relatively short-term issue for Arteta, the manager is increasingly anxious about the prospects of Folarin Balogun, a highly rated striker, committing his future to Arsenal. Balogun’s deal is up in July and a number of clubs are understood to be making inquiries about taking him on. Arteta suggested any stumbling block lay at the feet of the player’s representatives.“You need three parties to make a deal,” he said. “For sure the club wants to make a deal, the manager wants to make a deal, the player wants to stay and I’m not sure about the agent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90dce577f1e8434ee1e444d0dda057b6ef94b522/0_87_4503_2702/master/4503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e629495c60596e45c163390224db69f","title":"colin bell a life in pictures","story":"The ‘King of the Kippax’ has died aged 74 after a short illness – we take a look back at the career of the legendary Manchester City midfielder"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe1987e5d1df93e1f45f924dbea9467b78aa8b8e/631_358_4643_2788/master/4643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3648aadd82261cfe691b3debc2801e9","title":"the joys of being an absolute beginner for life","story":"The phrase ‘adult beginner’ can sound patronising. It implies you are learning something you should have mastered as a child. But learning is not just for the youngOne day a number of years ago, I was deep into a game of draughts on holiday with my daughter, then almost four, in the small library of a beachfront town. Her eye drifted to a nearby table, where a black-and-white board bristled with far more interesting figures (many a future chess master has been innocently drawn in by “horses” and “castles”).“What’s that?” she asked. “Chess,” I replied. “Can we play?” she pleaded. I nodded absently.There was just one problem: I didn’t know how. I dimly remembered having learned the basic moves as a kid, but chess had never stuck. This fact vaguely haunted me through my life. I would see an idle board in a hotel lobby or a puzzle in a weekend newspaper supplement, and feel a pang.I had picked up a general awareness of chess. I knew the names Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov. I knew that the game had enchanted historical luminaries including Marcel Duchamp and Vladimir Nabokov. I knew the cliche about grandmasters being able to look a dozen moves ahead. I knew that chess, like classical music, was shorthand in movies for genius – often of the evil variety. But I knew chess the way I “knew” the Japanese language: what it looks like, what it sounds like, its Japaneseness, without actually comprehending it.I decided to learn the game, if only to be able to teach my daughter. It took a few hours, hunched over my smartphone at kids’ birthday parties or waiting in line at Trader Joe’s, to get a feel for the basic moves. Soon, I was playing, and some-times even beating, the weakest computer opponents (the ones with catastrophic blunders abundantly programmed in). Yet it soon became apparent that I had little concept of the larger strategies. I didn’t want to try to teach what I knew only poorly.And yet, how to learn? The number of chess books was dauntingly huge. Sure, there was Chess for Dummies. But beyond that, the chess literature was enormous. It was filled with algebraic-looking thickets of chess notation, a quasi-language that itself had to be learned. And the books were achingly specific: for example, A Complete Guide to Playing 3 Nc3 Against the French Defence.That’s right: an entire book devoted to the permutations of a single move – a move that, I should add, has been regularly played for a century. Yet people were still figuring out, 100 years and many chess books later – 288 pages’ worth of new things to say about it.A well travelled fact that one hears early in chess is that after only three moves, there are more possible game variations than there are atoms in the universe. And, indeed, I felt cosmically stupefied as I tried to figure out how to boil down this exponentially complex game to someone whose favourite show was Curious George.So I did what any self-respecting modern parent does: I hired a coach. The twist was that I wanted someone to teach my daughter and me at the same time.For most of us, the beginner stage is something to be got through as quickly as possible, like a socially awkward skin condition. But even if we’re only passing through, we should pay particular attention to this moment. For once it goes, it’s hard to get back.Think of a time when you first visited a new, distant place, one with which you were barely familiar. Upon arrival, you were alive to every novelty. The smell of the food in the street! The curious traffic signs! The sound of the call to prayer! Flushed from the comfort of your usual surrounds, forced to learn new rituals and ways to communicate, you gained sensory superpowers. You paid attention to everything because you didn’t even know what you needed to know to get by. After a few days, as you became more expert in the place, what seemed strange began to become familiar. You began noticing less. You became safer in your knowledge. Your behaviour became more automatic.Even as your skills and knowledge progress, there is a potential value to holding on to that beginner’s mind. In what’s come to be known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, the psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger showed that on various cognitive tests the people who did the worst were also the ones who most “grossly overestimated” their actual performance. They were “unskilled and unaware of it”.This can certainly be a stumbling block for beginners. But additional research later showed that the only thing worse than hardly knowing anything was knowing a little bit more. This pattern appears in the real world: doctors learning a spinal surgery technique committed the most errors not on the first or second try, but on the 15th pilot errors, meanwhile, seem to peak not in the earliest stages but after about 800 hours of flight time.I’m not suggesting experts have much to fear from beginners. Experts, who tend to be “skilled, and aware of it”, are much more efficient in their problem-solving processes, more efficient in their movement (the best chess players, for example, tend also to be the best speed-chess players). They can draw upon more experience, and more finely honed reflexes. Beginner chess players will waste time considering a huge range of possible moves, while grandmasters zero in on the most relevant options (even if they then spend a lot of time calculating which of those moves are best).And yet, sometimes, the “habits of the expert”, as the Zen master Suzuki called it, can be an obstacle – particularly when new solutions are demanded. With all their experience, experts can come to see what they expect to see. Chess experts can become so entranced by a move they remember from a previous game that they miss a more optimal move on a different part of the board.This tendency for people to default to the familiar, even in the face of a more optimal novel solution, has been termed the Einstellung effect (after a German word that means “set”).In the famous “candle problem”, people are asked to attach a candle to the wall using nothing more than a box of matches and a box of tacks. People struggle to solve it because they get hung up on the “functional fixedness” of the box as a container for tacks, not as a theoretical shelf for the candle. There is one group, it turns out, that tends to do pretty well on the candle problem: five-year-olds.Why? The researchers who found this suggest that younger children have a more fluid “conception of function” than older children or adults. They are less hung up on things being for something, and more able to view them simply as things to be used in all sorts of ways. Small wonder they conquer new technology so handily everything is new for them.Children, in a very real sense, have beginners’ minds, open to wider possibilities. They see the world with fresher eyes, are less burdened with preconception and past experience, and are less guided by what they know to be true.They are more likely to pick up details that adults might discard as irrelevant. Because they’re less concerned with being wrong or looking foolish, children often ask questions that adults won’t ask.No one wants to stay a beginner. We all want to get better. But even as our skills improve, and our knowledge and experience grow, what I hope to encourage is the preservation, or even cultivation, of that spirit of the novice: the naive optimism, the hypervigilant alertness that comes with novelty and insecurity, the willingness to look foolish, and the permission to ask obvious questions – the unencumbered beginner’s mind.What the chess master Benjamin Blumenfeld advised a century ago applies as much to life as to chess: “Before you make your move, look at the position as if you were a beginner.”When my daughter first began competing in school chess tournaments, I would often chat to other parents. Sometimes, I’d ask if they played chess themselves. Usually, the reply was an apologetic shrug and a smile. When I volunteered that I was learning to play, the tone was cheerily patronising: “Good luck with that!” I thought: “If this game is so good for kids, why are adults ignoring it?” Seeing someone playing Angry Birds, I wanted to tap them on the shoulder and say: “Why are you having your kids do chess while you do that? This is the game of kings! There are chess games recorded from the 15th century!”At chess tournaments, I saw a dynamic that was all too familiar from the world of children’s activities: kids doing the activity, and adults like me staring into their smartphones.Sure, we parents had work to do, work that we allowed to spill into weekends, work that helped pay for the lessons our kids were enjoying (or enduring). But I also wondered if we, in our constant chaperoning of these lessons, were imparting a subtle lesson: that learning was for the young.Strolling down the hall during one tournament, I looked into a classroom and saw a group of parents with what I took to be an instructor. They were playing chess! Just then, as if on cue, a group of kids passed me, peering in on the same scene. “Why are adults learning chess?” one asked, in a vaguely mocking tone, to the collective amusement of the group. They marched on while I slowly died in front of a cheery bulletin board.I was tired of sitting on the sidelines. I wanted in. And that is how I got a membership card from the US Chess Federation and started throwing myself in.Early on, I was nervous, even though I really had nothing to lose, save my pride. “A master can sometimes play badly,” as one grandmaster put it, “a fan, never!” And fan I was: the sombre rituals, the pulse-pounding encounters, the tense atmosphere. It was three hours of sustained concentration and intense thinking, with my phone turned off. It felt like a gym for the brain.Being a beginner can be hard at any age, but it gets harder as you get older. Children’s brains and bodies are built for doing, failing, and doing again. We applaud virtually anything they do, because they are trying.With adults, it’s more complicated. The phrase “adult beginner” has an air of gentle pity. It reeks of obligatory retraining seminars and uncomfortable chairs. It implies the learning of something that you should have perhaps already learned.There is safety in sticking with what we’re already good at. “It’s hard to be old and bad at something,” as a friend, returning to hockey after many decades, put it. We can be so put off by being a beginner that we forget we were once beginners in all sorts of things, until we were not.Adult beginners face their own version of what is known by sporting coaches as “stereotype threat”, whereby a negative image becomes associated with a particular group of players, and leads them to repeat mistakes – in this case, one that says it’s harder to learn when you’re older. There’s a pernicious, goading little voice: “You’ve started too late. Why bother?” One day, at her swimming lesson, I was impressed to see my daughter “flip turn” at the end of the lane while doing a backstroke. This is not something I can do. “How’d you learn to do that?” I asked. “You have to be a kid,” she responded matter-of-factly.As I was finding out, this kind of idea is deeply ingrained in chess. There seems to be a relation between the age at which you first learned the game and your later success in tournaments. This idea is so pervasive that Magnus Carlsen, the current No 1, is held as a fascinating outlier. “At five years old,” one account marvels, “an age by which any aspiring grandmaster should at least have made a start, Magnus Carlsen showed little interest in chess.”Sitting down against younger opponents, I tried to keep in mind a bit of advice gleaned from the  writer Stephen Moss’s book The Rookie: just face them the way you would anyone else.This could be hard. The way they played just threw me. In the face of my agonised dithering, they would launch fast, brute-force attacks – sometimes effective, sometimes foolhardy. “Children just kind of go for it,” Daniel King, the English grandmaster and chess commentator, told me. “That kind of confidence can be very disconcerting for the opponent.”Young children, for example, have been shown to be faster and more accurate at tests involving “probabilistic sequence learning” – the sort in which people must guess which triggers will lead to what events (for example, if you press button A, event X will happen).After the age of 12, this ability begins to decline. As researchers suggest, people start relying more on “internal models” of cognition and reasoning, instead of what they see right in front of them. In other words, they overthink things. In chess games, where my adult opponents often seemed to battle unseen internal demons, the kids just seemed to twitch out a series of moves.I was buying into the stereotype threat. If I lost to an adult, I would chalk it up to my own stupid errors. But if I lost to a child, I would suddenly imagine them as some incipient genius against whom I never had a chance.When I asked our chess coach about what it was like to teach adult chess beginners as opposed to child chess beginners, he thought for a moment and said: “Adults need to explain to themselves why they play what they play.” Kids, he said, “don’t do that”. He compared it to languages: “Beginner adults learn the rules of grammar and pronunciation and use those to put sentences together. Little kids learn languages by talking.”The analogy goes deeper than we might think. My daughter was, in effect, learning chess like a first language, whereas I was learning it like a second language. Even more important, she was learning it young.Language is one of those endeavours (like music, and perhaps chess) that seems to flourish best if learned during a so-called “sensitive period” in which, as one researcher has described it, “neural systems are particularly responsive to relevant stimuli, and are more susceptible to change when stimulated”.By contrast, because I am an adult, expert speaker of English, my brain may be so “tuned” to the sounds of my native language that it is harder for me to take on new grammar. What I know already gets in the way of what I want to learn. Kids, by knowing less, can actually learn more (the cognitive scientist Elissa Newport calls it the “less-is-more hypothesis”).Harder does not mean impossible. “Sensitive” periods are not “critical” periods, and the science, in any case, is not conclusive. The skill of having perfect pitch, for example, which is not only exceedingly rare but has long been thought to be impossible outside a narrow age range in childhood, can be trained in some adults, as research from the University of Chicago has shown (albeit to not quite as high a level as those possessing “true” perfect pitch).Kids often make more progress simply because they are kids, with lives built largely around learning, having few other responsibilities, and with eager parents to cheer them on. They are also motivated: if you were dropped into an entirely new setting, the way infants are, and found that you couldn’t communicate, you’d probably learn pretty quickly.You may, by now, be rightly asking, why should I bother learning a bunch of things that aren’t relevant to my career? Why dabble in mere hobbies when I’m scrambling to keep up with the demands of a rapidly changing workplace?First, I might suggest that it’s not at all clear that learning something like singing or drawing actually won’t help you in your job – even if it’s not immediately obvious how.Learning has been proposed as an effective response to stress in one’s job. By enlarging one’s sense of self, and perhaps equipping us with new capabilities, learning becomes a “stress buffer”.Claude Shannon, the brilliant MIT polymath who helped invent the digital world in which we live today, plunged into all kinds of pursuits, from juggling to poetry to designing the first wearable computer. “Time and time again,” noted his biographer, “he pursued projects that might have caused others embarrassment, engaged questions that seemed trivial or minor, then managed to wring breakthroughs out of them.”Regularly stepping out of our comfort zones, at this historical moment, just feels like life practice. The fast pace of technological change turns us all, in a sense, into “perpetual novices”, always on the upward slope of learning, our knowledge constantly requiring upgrades, like our phones. Few of us can channel our unided attention into a lifelong craft. Even if we keep the same job, the required skills change. The more willing we are to be brave beginners, the better. As Ravi Kumar, president of the IT giant Infosys, described it: “You have to learn to learn, learn to unlearn, and learn to re-learn.”Second, it’s just good for you. I don’t mean only the things themselves – the singing or the drawing or the surfing – are good for you (although they are, in ways I’ll return to). I mean that skill learning itself is good for you.It scarcely matters what it is – tying nautical knots or throwing pottery. Learning something new and challenging, particularly with a group, has proven benefits for the “novelty-seeking machine” that is the brain. Because novelty itself seems to trigger learning, learning various new things at once might be even better. A study that had adults aged 58 to 86 simultaneously take multiple classes – ranging from Spanish to music composition to painting – found that after just a few months, the learners had improved not only at Spanish or painting, but on a battery of cognitive tests. They’d rolled back the odometers in their brains by some 30 years, doing better on the tests than a control group who took no classes.They’d changed in other ways, too: they felt more confident, they were pleasantly surprised by their work, and they kept getting together after the study ended.Skill learning seems to be additive it’s not only about the skill. A study that looked at young children who had taken swimming lessons found benefits beyond swimming. The swimmers were better at a number of other physical tests, such as grasping or hand-eye coordination, than non-swimmers. They also did better on reading and mathematical reasoning tests than non-swimmers, even accounting for factors such as socio-economic status.Many of these studies or recommendations are oriented toward children. Chess, for example, is held up as a way to improve children’s focus and concentration, to strengthen their problem-solving skills, to bolster their creative thinking. But I’ve become convinced that whenever something is touted as being good for children, it’s even better for adults, in part because we assume we no longer need all those benefits an activity is said to provide.And yet what better remedy for the widespread affliction of “smartphone addiction” than two hours of burning your eyes and brain into 64 squares on a board, trying to analyse an almost infinite variety of moves and countermoves?Learning new skills also changes the way you think, or the way you see the world. Learning to sing changes the way you listen to music, while learning to draw is a striking tutorial on the human visual system. Learning to weld is a crash course in physics and metallurgy. You learn to surf and suddenly you find yourself interested in tide tables and storm systems and the hydrodynamics of waves. Your world got bigger because you did.Last, if humans seem to crave novelty, and novelty helps us learn, one thing that learning does is equip us with how to better handle future novelty. “More than any other animal, we human beings depend on our ability to learn,” the psychologist Alison Gopnik has observed. “Our large brain and powerful learning abilities evolved, most of all, to deal with change.” We’re always flipping between small moments of incompetence and mastery. Sometimes, we cautiously try to work out how we’re going to do something new.Sometimes, we read a book or look for an instructional video. Sometimes, we just have to plunge in. • This is an edited extract from Beginners: The Curious Power of Lifelong Learning by Tom Vanderbilt is published by Atlantic and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, sign up to the long read weekly email here, and find our podcasts here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dca4a2378e2fdc6dec875337df08a92790567ac/0_0_3600_2400/master/3600.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cc4291f9063c7617771e0e55e1f1ae2a 1400w","title":"deaf asl interpreters pandemic","story":"More people than ever are being exposed to sign language through Covid press briefings as interpreters work to pass on vital informationSaamanta Serna describes herself as a Coda – the child of a Deaf adult. She grew up up with a Deaf mother and a father who is hearing and an American sign language (ASL) interpreter, and later decided to pursue interpreting herself after high school.Now a certified ASL interpreter, Serna has done frequent in-person interpreting for medical appointments during Covid. She has also noticed a change in the world’s perception of sign language since the beginning of the pandemic: more people are paying attention.Conveying updated information to everyone in the time of Covid is a matter of life or death, as the Trump administration learned recently after losing a groundbreaking federal lawsuit to the National Association for the Deaf, which ensured that a sign language interpreter must be present in Covid briefings and visible on the live feed from the White House. The Trump White House did not include its first sign language interpreter on a Covid briefing until 11 November, a full nine months after the pandemic reached America.Even within ASL there are wide variants, differences in rhythm or slang, even regional accents and dialects. Black American Sign Language (BASL), for example, is a dialect of ASL developed during segregation. Black dDeaf Americans, denied deaf education, socialized language differently than white dDeaf Americans, with unique hand positions and word formations. Nakia Smith, a 22-year-old who is the fourth deaf generation in her family, explained this recently in a video from Netflix. (Smith’s TikTok channel, which featured her and her grandpa signing and explaining BASL, recently went viral.)Perhaps the interest in signing is due, in part, to pandemic mask-wearing. Masks muffle speech, making it more difficult to communicate using spoken language, even for those who are hearing. For those like me, who are hard of hearing and utilize lip reading, it’s virtually impossible.More people than ever are also being exposed to sign language through frequent Covid-related press conferences. Alongside governors and medical officers, in press briefings and media events, on television and online, sign language interpreters are working to pass on vital information.Translating spoken English to sign language requires interpreters like Berkowitz, who is also certified by the supreme court of Ohio and the Ohio department of education. She made national news with her work signing for Ohio’s governor, Mike DeWine. Admirers made a Facebook fan page, and she even has her own bobblehead doll.Other interpreters who have gone viral recently include Nic Zapko, who works with the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz David Cowan, known for interpreting Governor Brian Kemp’s press conferences in Georgia and Arkady Belozovsky, who grabbed the world’s attention when he interpreted an intense exchange between the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, and reporters.Viewers have been drawn to Berkowitz’s energy, animated manner and expressions. Facial expressions, as Berkowitz said, “are an equivalent to intonation, revealing feelings, thoughts and mood while simultaneously utilizing the grammar markers (eye-gazing, eyebrow raisedlowered …) to distinguish statements from questions”. It’s not simply dramatic effect, but essential to the language. “I wish that people would normalize this communication access versus just making it a show,” said Serna.I talked to Brian Cheslik, the artistic director for Deaf Austin Theatre and an interpreter for performances. Cheslik is also dDeaf, as is Berkowitz, in a field where many interpreters are hearing. Both Cheslik and Berkowitz spoke to the importance of working together with hearing interpreters, especially when information may be impromptu or rapidly evolving. “I cherish my hearing interpreters on my team because they are always there to help me when I miss something, or if there is a change or announcement made,” Cheslik said, characterizing work with hearing interpreters as “a very important relationship”.Perhaps no recent situation has a more urgent need for clear information than Covid press conferences. These conferences relay ever-changing regulations, and provide essential medical advice on stopping the spread of the virus. “Interpreting during Covid is challenging in every way,” Berkowitz said, describing handling press conference jargon, teamwork with other interpreters who may have different styles, and “the tremendous responsibility with getting accurate information in ASL”.“The greatest joy is knowing the Deaf and hard of hearing community are receiving first-hand information seen on TV in ASL for the very first time in our lives,” Berkowitz said.“To have Deaf interpreters spotlighted and highlighted during events like Joe Biden’s press conferences has been so amazing,” says Serna. “Also the fact that that he is normalizing having an interpreter on camera.”All the interpreters interviewed for this story spoke to the struggle of getting sign language to be respected by the hearing population – a struggle I remember from my own studies, when I fought with my hearing professors who said ASL was not a “real” language, and would not count for my degree.“ASL is NOT broken English or even a form of English. ASL is an actual language with its own grammatical structure, and syntax that is embedded in Deaf culture,” Cheslik said. “Yes, ASL is beautiful, but it is our language.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8baca9765c955a2450ca6f57bfd5401b31881e3/0_335_5358_3215/master/5358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=080cb4ac9a12bd209931402a86aaba48","title":"call to provide shelter for rough sleepers over uk winter lockdown","story":"Homelessness groups urge government to act decisively and reboot ‘Everybody In’ schemeHomelessness campaigners have demanded an urgent reboot of the government’s “Everybody In” scheme in England to provide safe shelter for thousands of rough sleepers as the UK enters another lockdown, with winter temperatures expected to plummet.They have called on ministers to reissue strict guidance sent out in March within days of the first lockdown, which required local authorities to provide emergency accommodation to anybody at risk of being left out on the street.“With another lockdown in force, rates of infection at record highs and freezing weather, no one should be facing the streets right now. The government has to act decisively and bring absolutely everyone in,” said Polly Neate, the chief executive of the housing charity Shelter.The Crisis charity also called for speedy action: “It can’t be right for people to be sleeping on the streets in the dead of winter during a pandemic, especially when support services relied on by rough sleepers cannot operate,” said Matt Downie, Crisis’s director of policy.Renters’ groups have called for a further extension to the ban on evictions, again in place since March, which is due to end on Monday. Charities are warning of an “avalanche” of private renters turned out of their homes over the next few weeks if no action is taken.During the first lockdown the Everybody In policy saw approximately 29,000 people helped into settled accommodation, with thousands initially housed in budget hotels. The wide scope of the March guidance meant that even people normally ineligible to access homelessness support, such as migrants, were offered help.But since June, when the guidance lapsed, and the economic recession started to deepen, homelessness numbers have been creeping back up in some parts of the country, including London, where there are an estimated 700 rough sleepers on a typical night.The government has promised further measures to protect rough sleepers will be set out soon. But Labour says ministers have been too slow to act, despite warnings months ago, including from doctors who said rough sleepers could die without urgent action.Ministers’ sensitivity over the issue was reflected on Wednesday when the press office at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) broke with convention by tweeting a rebuttal to the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, after he tweeted that failure to act urgently on rough sleeping would “cost lives”.Meanwhile, a letter to the  signed on behalf of the 20 members of the Renters Reform Coalition, which includes renters, housing and poverty groups, warns that more people are at risk of eviction than during the first lockdown in March.It says: “The government must now ban evictions for the duration of any lockdown measures, to keep renters safe. A full eviction ban means pausing all court proceedings, as well as bailiff action. Renters should not be forced to attend proceedings that may put their health at risk.”One of the members of the coalition, Citizens Advice, estimates that at least 500,000 private renters across the UK are currently in arrears. The average amount owed on rent is £700, with a total of £360m owed to landlords.Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson on housing, called for the eviction ban to be extended. “It would be nice if the government didn’t leave something this vital to the last minute.”An MHCLG spokesperson said: “We will do everything in our power to prevent people from finding themselves sleeping rough or homeless this winter, and that remains the policy of the government.“The ongoing ‘Everyone In’ campaign is protecting thousands of lives. We’ve housed 29,000 vulnerable people including supporting 19,000 into settled accommodation or with ‘move on’ support. We’re ensuring councils and voluntary organisations have the tools and funding they need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc2e19c3e5c27d2fc3fbe72dd0b8dabc97c88c4c/0_268_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e043d9351b54de0a496af5c4338db624","title":"taylor townsend women have kids but it doesnt stop you tennis has evolved","story":"The American on her pregnancy, changing attitudes and making it in tennis despite discouragement from an early ageAs tennis players around the world make their slow return to competition this week after months away, there is one notable player who will not be joining them for a while. In the final months of last season, Taylor Townsend announced she is pregnant and will give birth in March.Some female players who are mothers would rather their tennis was front and centre in their profession and so her case is to be noted simply because it is a clear reflection of a recent cultural change in women’s tennis. In short, this is becoming a normal career option in women’s tennis for those who choose to do so.“I think that 15 years ago if you were pregnant and you had a kid, it was over,” says Townsend. “The whole dynamic has just changed and I think the sport has evolved and realised that this is part of a woman’s life. This is part of what comes with being a woman. Women get pregnant, they have kids, but it doesn’t stop what you’re doing. And it doesn’t stop the path that you want to be on.”When Townsend announced the news in October, she did so in style. In a social media video the American described in chronological order some of the many times people have doubted her with their toxic words and that she will not be perturbed by her next challenge. Her first example was most shocking: at only four years old she was told to quit tennis. “I was told ‘you’re too fat’, ‘you can’t move’, ‘you need to stop’, ‘she’s not going to make it’, ‘she’s too big’. I got all of that kind of dumb shit. That’s what I’ve heard since I started playing.”This has been a constant theme in Townsend’s career, particularly since 2012 when, despite being junior world No 1, the United States Tennis Association asked her to withdraw from the junior US Open claiming her fitness was insufficient. Even at the US Open last year, while she was pregnant, the comments endured. “I stopped listening to that and was like: ‘I need to be happy with who I am. I have to be OK with me,’” she says. “You’re never gonna look like them, that’s fine. But that’s not stopping me from going out and whooping ass. Whatever the thing that you say is holding me back, I can use that as a way to propel me to move forward.”The obstacles Townsend has faced have only toughened her skin and fuelled her drive. “I’m in a cool space because the things I went through as a kid, starting out, I will never allow that to happen to my child. It has given me an opportunity to learn from the things I went through and to be able to shape and change the path for my child. Because I’ll fight someone if they try to tell my four-year-old that they can’t do something. It’s just insane. Those types of people won’t be around.”Townsend recently revealed she is in a financial dispute with her mother over endorsement funds and says this has had a significant effect on how she carries herself. Her circle is smaller. She is not prepared to trust without being certain it will be reciprocated with trustworthiness. “I’ve gone through a sifting-out process and really got rid of all the garbage. Now I’m in the place that I’m pregnant, I’m having a kid, I’m not playing right now. When I go through that process, I will know and it’s very clear what I expect.”In one of her last prominent appearances before the pandemic, Townsend reached the fourth round of the 2019 US Open after beating Simona Halep 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4) in round two. At a time when most players spend their time running away from the net, it was perhaps the greatest net-rushing performance of the generation. She approached the net more than 100 times and in the final set she essentially attempted to serve and volley on every first and second serve.She describes the moment as a “pivotal point” in her career that imbued her with the confidence to know she really can beat top players. Those ambitions are not paused and Townsend is already planning for her return between March and May of 2022 after taking some time to learn the ropes of motherhood. There is more to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99733c2a1b1e61a966f078367704594bb92c4c55/356_211_2273_1365/master/2273.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b73f90ebd7ca8281b103a61a121e5e96","title":"cake decorating quizzes and remote lunches keeping staff connected in the remote work era","story":"We can’t meet for a chat by the coffee machine right now, so how are firms keeping spirits high? With creative and fun virtual activities, it seemsNurturing a sense of shared purpose with work colleagues is challenging in these days of remote work and video meetings. Gone are post-work pints, sandwich-queue chats, tasting your colleague’s “cake-off” creation, and anything else resembling physical proximity and connection to your team. But with a little ingenuity – and a tolerance for 2D socialising – it’s still possible to keep spirits high and have fun.From virtual magicians and online games to judging cakes purely on how delicious they look on Zoom, employees are finding new ways to bond with colleagues – remotely. Events such as quizzes and lunchtime yoga may even have become more popular now that people can log on from home rather than having to stay late at the office or endure a lunch-hour sweat.Jade Emmons, a London-based communications manager for Degreed, a US education technology company, spent part of Halloween in fancy dress, running around her home seeking random items of clothing and a pumpkin as part of a competitive scavenger hunt. That was one of several online games held during her company’s virtual party.Other companies have been equally imaginative. One media organisation replaced its summer party with a global rendition of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, in which correspondents from around the world took on some of Shakespeare’s most popular roles.Meanwhile, at Kindred, a PR firm, winning the 2020 baking competition hinges on how well you can pipe icing rather than perfect the best rise, as in previous years. Each participant received a Betty Crocker cake mix, so the real challenge was the decoration. A Chris Whitty cake – very 2020 – dreamed up by associate director Beccie Stevenson, made it to the final round. “You can’t taste it so it’s all down to the aesthetic,” she says.Stevenson is also a fan of a monthly initiative called Change Maker that gets people to nominate a colleague of the month. Her last pick was Emma Parrish, who won in October for the effort she put into suggesting books, podcasts and music to celebrate Black History Month. “She tackled quite difficult conversations, head on,” says Stevenson. Each winner gets to virtually spin a wheel to win a prize, which ranges from an alarm clock to a pair of sheepskin slippers.Nick Winham, whose job is overseeing a programme to recruit and train the next generation of talent for the software provider ServiceNow, is one of the California-based company’s culture champions, helping to run initiatives to keep its dispersed workforce feeling connected. He says the shift to remote working has resulted in many more people taking part in events such as quizzes. “When we did them at the office, we’d only get 15 people at most,” he says. “Doing them virtually, we’re getting 40 to 50. Other colleagues join in with their families.” Virtual yoga and meditation sessions are also proving to be much more popular than the real-life versions ever were.For companies keen to introduce their own programmes, Winham’s tips include blocking off time during the working day for non-work sessions. His quizzes, for instance, are at 4pm on Thursdays, with a takeaway pizza prize for the winner. “It gets very competitive,” he says.A “step-up” challenge earlier this summer, where ServiceNow colleagues formed teams to record their daily step counts, proved popular thanks to a novel twist that saw two executive directors volunteer to do something different with their hair depending on how much money was raised during the week-long challenge. “That created engagement,” Winham says. “Step-up September” developed as a result, with teams from across Europe.Other activities encourage people to chat openly about the challenges of working from home, with some offering coping tips. “The main advice has been to take a break,” Winham says, adding that he went for a walk before talking to me.London-based LocalGlobe, which invests in startup tech companies, hosts virtual “lunch and learn sessions” with guests as erse as the founder of the small business supporter Funding Circle and a representative of the anti-poverty group Camden Giving.

His mother, he said, used to pick “somebody else’s cotton” as a teenager.“The other day, because this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else’s cotton picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,” he said. “Tonight, we proved with hope, hard work and the people by our side, anything is possible.”The Democrats were propelled to victory in Senate runoff elections by Black voters, young voters and new arrivals to the rapidly ersifying state, a coalition just strong enough to topple a long-dominant GOP and take control of the US Senate.The coalition closely mirrored the one that handed Georgia’s electoral college votes to President-elect Joe Biden, the first Democrat to win the state since 1992. In defeating Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, Democrats will have half the seats in the chamber, leaving Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris to serve as tie-breaker.The high-stakes runoffs drew hundreds of millions of dollars, media attention and a massive organizing effort. The result was a game of inches – both Republicans and Democrats largely held their voters from November, the survey showed, but Democrats did just slightly better in pushing their voters to the polls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a69d20a920b0b059c1bcc86af9a51cc05025c12b/0_0_7068_4241/master/7068.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=290bc15cb968d674e283b2c209343077","title":"gp surgeries england begin offering oxford coronavirus vaccine","story":"Andy Street accuses local MPs of spreading misinformationThe West Midlands mayor has insisted the region will not run out of the coronavirus vaccine in 24 hours, following concerns about supplies across the country.Andy Street accused Birmingham MPs, including his Conservative party colleague Andrew Mitchell, of spreading misinformation after they signed a letter claiming the city was due to run out of the vaccine by Friday.Street said there was “no threat” of Pfizer jabs running out in Birmingham on Friday and that new supplies had been ordered and were in “sufficient supply”.He said he had been assured by the vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, that the city of 2.6 million people will receive the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine on Friday, and added: “The idea that Birmingham will have no vaccines from tomorrow onwards is completely false. Misinformation that causes undue concern is not what the public need in the middle of a pandemic.”The row came as some GP surgeries said they had faced issues getting the coronavirus vaccine, while others started administering the OxfordAstraZeneca jab on Thursday. The deployment comes after the UK daily reported death toll topped 1,000 and London hospitals were said to be on the brink of being overwhelmed.It is hoped more than 700 sites in England will be delivering vaccines by the end of the week in a mass vaccination drive the prime minister has said is now a race.GPs have been given instructions to “stand down non-essential work” in order to focus on the delivery of the jabs, the Daily  reported. Lucy Watson, the chair of the Patients Association, told the newspaper: “For patients to be confident that the NHS remains open for business it would be helpful for there to be clear messages from NHS England about which healthcare activities are being stopped in primary care and which healthcare activities are being continued.”The Birmingham row erupted following a letter sent to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, by Ian Ward, the city council leader, the Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell and Labour MP Liam Byrne in which they said the city’s Pfizer stock was due to run out on Friday “with currently no clarity on when further supplies will arrive”.The letter added: “It remains unclear who is responsible for overseeing the vaccination programme in Birmingham and whom we should hold to account for progress and delivery. I am sure you would agree that such a lack of transparency is unhelpful and frustrating.” The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine – with the second jab taking place 12 weeks after the first – is easier to administer as it can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, unlike the PfizerBioNTech jab, which requires long-term storage at -70C.The government’s joint committee on vaccination and immunisation has published a list of groups of people who will be prioritised to receive a vaccine for Covid-19 in the UK. The list is:1 All those 80 years of age and over and health and social care workers.2 All those 75 and over.3 All those 70 and over.4 All those 65 and over.5 Adults under 65 at high at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.6 Adults under 65 at moderate risk of at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.7 All those 60 and over.8 All those 55 and over.9 All those 50 and over.10 Rest of the population.Seven mass vaccination centres will open next week in London, Newcastle, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Surrey and Stevenage.There were claims GPs have delayed vaccination clinics repeatedly because the delivery of supplies has been inconsistent. Richard Vautrey, who chairs the British Medical Association’s GP committee, told the Times it was “crucial that practices are given greater certainty over delivery date, which then do not change, and as much notice as possible of any potential delays so they can effectively mitigate the impact of rescheduling patients last minute”.One Bristol medical centre reportedly had its first batch, due on 22 December, cancelled at the last minute. A vaccination site in Rochdale, told to expect more than 1,000 doses this weekend, was then told they would not arrive, the Times reported.The ad hoc nature of the rollout was highlighted when it emerged that a surgery visited on Thursday by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to promote the initiative had yet to receive promised supplies of the OxfordAstraZeneca product.Standing in front of the Bloomsbury Surgery in central London, Hancock said: “It’s great news this morning that the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine is from right now being rolled out to GP surgeries across the country.”But GP Ammara Hughes, a partner in the surgery, told Sky News that its first delivery had been pushed back 24 hours to Friday. She said Hancock was “quite surprised actually to learn that we don’t know when all of our deliveries are coming, they’re very ad hoc”. The surgery was continuing in the meantime to vaccinate with the Pfizer vaccine."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452527.1610043840!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"asti tells members not to cooperate with schools reopening plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlexandra College in Milltown, south Dublin, said it would not reopen for Leaving Certificate students. The teachers’ union the ASTI has instructed its members not to coperate with the Government plan to reopen schools three days a week for Leaving Certificate students.The moves comes as one Dublin secondary school announced that it would defy the Government decision to partially reopen schools next Monday.Alexandra College in Milltown, south Dublin, has told parents and students that a partial reopening would pose unacceptable health risks.Principal Barbara Ennis said: “I honestly believe we’ve made the right decision and I would be very surprised if the Government does not reverse the move to reopen schools. Many other schools are up in arms. I think we’ll be the first of many not to reopen.”She said schools, unions and principals had not been consulted over a decision which would jeopardise the health of staff and students.“As principal, I am personally responsible for the health, safety and wellbeing of staff. If we reopen, I cannot guarantee any of those things. I’d be going against the very tenets of my job,” she said.A number of other secondary schools are meeting to consider taking similar action in light of the public health threat posed by Covid-19.The ASTI’s standing committee met on Thursday afternoon, noting it had not been consulted before the reopening announcement.In a statement, the ASTI said it had not been provided with the necessary assurances that schools were sufficiently safe for students and teachers at this time, in the context of the new variant of Covid-19 circulating in the community and the alarmingly high numbers.Its standing committee said it had decided to direct its members not to cooperate with the arrangements announced by the Minister for Education for in-school teaching, but to engage in remote teaching learning provision from Monday, January 11th.“The decision is based on significant concerns about the health and safety of students, teachers and other staff,” it said.Speaking after the meeting, ASTI president Ann Piggott said: “The ASTI has repeatedly sought sufficient assurances that schools are safe for students and teachers at this time, in the context of the new variant of Covid-19 circulating in the community and the alarmingly high numbers.“We engaged with the Department of Education and with public health officials today. Unfortunately, the assurances we sought have not been forthcoming.”Another principal, who declined to be named, said the school may also remain closed due to logistical problems in delivering in-person and online classes.“We have a full online timetable ready to go, but now our teachers are being asked to come into school for sixth years for three days and teach the rest online. How is that possible?” the principal said.“Many teachers have primary school children. This will weaken provision for all other students. It’s a mess.”\u0026nbspIn the past the Department of Education has ordered schools to reopen where they have closed for safety reasons without the approval of public health officials.When asked what consequences there will be, if any, for schools who decide to remain closed, a spokesman only said Leaving Cert students “will attend school three days a week” from Monday next and that the department will fund all necessary infection prevention measures.In addition, special schools and special classes are due to reopen for an estimated 18,000 pupils.ResistanceHowever, there is growing resistance from teachers’ unions and principals’ representatives.The National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals has suggested a delay in reopening is now inevitable.In a statement on Thursday afternoon, its director Clive Byrne said: “Online learning will commence as planned from next Monday for all pupils. A blended approach of face-to-face and online learning is the optimum model but sufficient time is needed to consider and agree all aspects of this in full.“Taking sufficient time also enables us to fully account for the consequences of related personal challenges faced by teachers, including childcare and positiveclose-contact cases.”Earlier, the Principals’ and Deputy Principals’ Association of the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) called on Minister for Education Norma Foley to reverse the decision.President of the PDA Adrian Power said it has “grave concerns” about the safety and logistics of reopening schools for face-to-face learning for Leaving Cert students and special classes .“We believe that the decision of the Government – made without any consultation – is deeply damaging, particularly in light of the huge efforts of all in the school communities since the commencement of the academic year,” he said.Special needsFórsa trade union, which represents more than 12,000 staff in primary and secondary schools throughout the country, including special needs assistants (SNAs) is seeking a pause on the implementation of the policy to reopen special education schools and special classes.The union said the Government’s plans were “unrealistic” and advised the Minister that thousands of school staff would be unable to attend work next Monday.Andy Pike, the union’s head of education, said the plans could not proceed without “due consideration of the operational and safety issues arising”.“Many thousands of staff will be unable to attend work on Monday, January 11th, either due to childcare problems, genuine concerns as to the ability of their employer to provide a safe working environment as required in legislation, or both,” he said.However, special needs campaigners said it is vital that special schools and classes reopen.Adam Harris, chief executive of the autism charity AsIAm, said special classes and schools “must be supported to remain open at this most critical time”.“These educational settings provide essential support for some of the most vulnerable children within our State. Children with the most complex needs are only able to learn in appropriately structured environments, with highly skilled staff in clear routines,” he said.“The evidence is indisputable: remote learning, owing to cognitive differences, does not work for these young people. We saw the devastation this caused during the last lockdown with children losing hard-won skills in the areas of communication, social interaction and personal care, becoming totally overwhelmed and distressed at home and losing the supports which will ultimately determine the quality of life and level of independence a person can enjoy as they grow up.”On Wednesday, Ms Foley said the decision had been made in the best interests of students, especially those facing into exams and with learning disabilities.She said schools and teachers had proved resilient in the past in reopening schools and she was convinced the education sector would “not be found wanting” in reopening again in a limited way.For all other students, schools will be required to put in place remote-learning provisions from next Monday and to communicate these plans directly to families.Under the plan, Leaving Cert final-year students would attend school three days per week, with the other two days’ learning being supported by their teachers remotely.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Company delivered 14m parcels in December, double the level of same period in 2019About 335,600 people will receive the benefit this week"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452360.1610021461!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 vaccine rollout starts in nursing homes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Government hopes to vaccinate all 30,000 nursing home residents and 35,000 staff in the country by the end of next monthThe rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine in privately owned and voluntary nursing homes began on Thursday morning. Twenty-two nursing homes are scheduled to receive the vaccinations from today, with about 3,000 residents and staff to be vaccinated this week.The Government hopes to vaccinate all 30,000 nursing home residents and 35,000 staff in the country’s 582 nursing homes by the end of next month.Tadhg Daly, chief executive of Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI), said it is continuing to engage with the HSE on “expediting rollout of the vaccine to nursing homes across the country in as quick a manner as feasible”. “Every day of the week presents opportunity for nursing home residents and staff to be vaccinated. Experienced peer vaccinators employed within these specialised healthcare settings must be enabled to avail of Covid-specific training to support in the administration of the vaccine to nursing home residents,” Mr Daly said. “Every day counts and every element of support must be utilised. We require a commitment nursing homes will also be encompassed within the seven-day-a week rollout of the vaccine.”John Cremin (95), from Knocknagree, Co Cork and resident at Killarney Community Hospital, was the first community hospital resident to receive the vaccine in Co Kerry.“I’m very glad to be getting my vaccine today – it’s not something that happens every week,” Mr Cremin said.The father-of-four has six grandchildren and has been a resident at Killarney Community Hospital since 2013. He said he is looking forward to a time when he can have visitors again.“We haven’t been able to have visitors for a while now. I’m not a bit worried about getting the vaccine, it’s good that it’s here,” he said.Director of nursing Máire Flynn was the first staff member at Killarney Community Hospital to be vaccinated.“I am delighted that we are receiving the vaccine, and so happy for our residents and our staff. We are so grateful to everyone who has made this happen, and so happy to be a part of this. Our residents are very excited, and are thrilled to be getting something that gives us all new hope for 2021,” she said. Cork Kerry Community Healthcare said it expects to have vaccination teams travelling to more than 30 public and private facilities in the counties throughout next week. “We expect to vaccinate more than 3,500 staff and residents next week alone, and this programme will accelerate in the following weeks,” it said.

Photograph: Julian BehalThe Cabinet has agreed a range of further lockdown measures, including to keep schools closed but allow Leaving Cert students to attend three days per week, and to close non-essential construction projects.The new measures will be in place until “at least the end of January” , Taoiseach Micheál Martin said.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar suggested some restrictions could remain in place past February 1st. “If I was running a business now, I would be thinking there’s a probability I’ll be closed until the end of March,” he said.Mr Varadkar said the regulations would be reviewed at the end of January, but warned “the situation is deteriorating... we won’t be out of the woods by the end of January”.Dig DeepWe “must dig deep within ourselves and face the coming month with steely determination and resolve”, Mr Martin said after the Cabinet meeting.“We have risen to all the challenges that have presented themselves… we may now be entering the most challenging phase of all,” he said.“The personal decisions we make... will directly affect how many more people get sick and how many people die”.“We are in a battle against deadly and ever changing virus,” he said.“ Unless you are involved in absolutely essential work you have no reason to be away from your home,” he said.Ministers agreed that all Leaving Cert students will be permitted to attend school for three days a week from next week.Schools will close for other children with learning moving online. However the Cabinet agreed to keep special schools and special classes in mainstream schools open for an estimated 15,000 pupils.Minister for Culture Catherine Martin’s officials have engaged with RTÉ, TG4 and the Department of Education about restarting learning from home programmes immediately.ChildcareCabinet agreed that essential workers will be allowed to form a bubble with another household in order to provide childcare if they do not have an existing arrangement, under plans discussed by the Cabinet.Childcare services, including regulated childminders and other childcare arrangements, will be permitted to continue to provide services but only for vulnerable children and children of essential workers.ConstructionNon-essential construction work will have to finish at 6pm on Friday.Work on social housing that is nearly completion will be permitted but only if it satisfies set criteria. Large infrastructure projects, understood to include the likes of the National Children’s Hospital and large school building projects, will continue, and emergency maintenance or repair work by plumbers, electricians and gas workers will be allowed continue.TravelCabinet also agreed that a ban on travel from Britain and South Africa will be be lifted this coming Saturday. But passengers must provide a negative PCR test from the previous 72 hours and isolate for 14 days on arrival. This requirement will then be rolled out to all incoming passengers.Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said failure to provide a negaative test be subject to a fine of up to €2,500 or six months imprisonment.He said the Cabinet has agreed provisionally to apply these restrictions to other red list countries He said this will be very difficult for the travel industry and for iniduals who may have plans for travelThe Cabinet also agreed that click and collect services for non-essential retail outlets will no longer be permitted with immediate effect in what will be a big blow for the sector. Click and deliver will continue to be permitted.Getting worseThe meeting came against a backdrop of a significant rise in cases of the disease and with hospitals generally and intensive care units coming under pressure.Mr Martin urged people to remember Mariter Tarugo, the Philippines native who worked at a healthcare assistant at St Vincent’s Hospital and died with Covid-19 on Christmas Eve.Tánaiste Leo Vardkar said “This is bad, it’s getting worse, and we’re only beginning to see the impact on our hospitals”He said the Government was engaging with the banks to ensure payment breaks for mortgage holders and those with loans“January is the month in which we all stay in,” he said.Mr Martin said he was “very worried” about the spread of the UK variant of Covid in the State. “The variant is of huge concern to me, because of the potential of what it could do,” the Taoiseach said, adding that there would be extensive work to improve Ireland’s sequencing capacities and provide real time data on the spread of the variant in the weeks ahead.Mr Martin said the vaccine taskforce was significantly more confident on the supply of Pfizer-BioNtech’s vaccine in the coming months, which would mean a smaller “buffer” would be held in reserve. However, he said there was no clear timeline for the delivery of more than 800,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine approved on Wednesday to the State.“The numbers will be a help on top of Pfizer BioNtech,” he said, “but they’re not huge numbers, and we don’t have a clear timeline in terms of the release to us.” He said, however, that the “only issue holding back the vaccine programme will be the supply of vaccines into the country”.Mr Varadkar said that by the end of February, he anticipated the State being able to vaccinate all residents and nursing home staff, as well as healthcare workers on the frontline. If more vaccines come on stream, he said the timeline could speed up.“That’s with Pfizer and Moderna, if AstraZeneca comes in and becomes available we can step that up and step that up more,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics covid 19 was this inevitable","story":"In our first podcast of the year, Hugh talks to The  health and political editors, Paul Cullen and Pat Leahy, and political analyst and statistician Kevin Cunningham about the social and political ramifications of the recent dramatic rise in Covid-19 cases.

Image: CNN Screengrab.Irish journalist Donie O’Sullivan said he was “overwhelmed by all the love from Ireland” on Wednesday night after he starred in US network CNN’s coverage of the siege at the Capitol in Washington. The Co Kerry native was praised on social media for his reporting from the scene as supporters of outgoing president Donald Trump stormed the building.He calmly relayed news back to the studio as hosts including veteran Wolf Blitzer urged him to “stay safe” amid the unrest and hostility towards journalists at the scene. O’Sullivan at one point reported that he had heard one of those present saying ‘next time we’re coming back with rifles’. His exploits saw ‘Donie’ trending on Twitter in Ireland. Comedian Dara Ó Briain was amongst those who congratulated the reporter, saying “CNN just introduced a reporter called Donie O’Sullivan and fair dues, he sounds exactly like you’d hope”. John King, CNN’s chief national correspondent, described O’Sullivan as “awesome”. Screenwriter Declan Lawn said of O’Sullivan: “All the other CNN correspondents can’t believe this stuff and are freaking out but Donie O’Sullivan is strolling around like he’s seen far worse coming out of a Carlow nightclub.”Responding to the outpouring on social media, O’Sullivan said on Twitter that he was “overwhelmed by all the love from Ireland tonight”. When asked about his experience on RTÉ’s Today programme on Thursday, O’Sullivan said it had been “surreal beyond belief”. “Imagine rioters swinging from the chandelier in Dáil Éireann,” he said.O’Sullivan said serious questions would have to be asked about how, in one of the “most protected cities in the world,” protesters could get into the grounds of the Capitol and also the Capitol building itself. The Cahirciveen man said he was fortunate not to have encountered any aggression from the protesters, but he knew of some colleagues who had been in “difficult situations” during the unrest. He said he had encountered different types of protesters - from pensioners wandering the grounds to “guys dressed up as soldiers who probably never served a day in their lives and were playing dress up yesterday”. He said that had it been a Black Lives Matter protest, he doubted the protesters would have been allowed near the Capitol building, never mind inside and onto the Senate floor.O’Sullivan has been working as a reporter with CNN for almost five years and prior to this spent over two years working as a journalist for Storyful in New York and Dublin.He has an undergraduate degree in history, politics and international relations from University College Dublin (UCD) and a masters degree in political science and government from Queen’s University Belfast.

An accurate and fair election was organised across 50 states and attracted a record-breaking level of participation: 155 million people cast their votes – and all in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic.For Americans, the act of postponing legally-mandated elections is an almost unthinkable prospect, flying in the face of constitutional practice over nearly 250 years. In Britain, not so much. Here, local, regional and even national elections can be scheduled then rescheduled with hardly a voice raised in protest.In Scotland, for example, there was outrage when it sunk in that the coalition government’s commitment to the Fixed Term Parliaments Act meant that the next general election would fall on the same day as the planned Scottish Parliament elections of 2015. Immediately there was a general consensus that Scots, uniquely among the peoples of the globe, are incapable of choosing two sets of politicians on the same day. Your average Florida citizen may well be able to get his head round the task of electing a president, a governor, a senator, a congressman and a swathe of locally elected officials, including the country dog catcher, all on the same day – and that’s before he turns his attention to the inevitable local referendums he’s also asked to make a judgment on – but no, Scots being asked to elect an MP and an MSP on the same day was simply beyond us. Luckily, we weren’t being asked to chew gum as well. And so Holyrood, using powers that for some reason David Cameron saw fit to pass to it, did what all politicians instinctively do when given the chance: it gave itself an extra year in office. And not just for that parliamentary term, but for every parliamentary term to come.So it was inevitable that the stubborn nature of coronavirus would turn our national leaders’ minds towards a postponement of May’s planned elections, some of which have already been delayed from last year. So far, the thinking in Whitehall seems to be that they should go ahead as planned, but that the decision will be kept “under review”. Philip Cowley, the renowned psephologist (he studies elections) recognised this form of words for the alarm bell it represented, writing yesterday of his fears that, as per the British tradition, ministers will “insist that the elections go ahead, right up until the day that they are postponed”, a situation that would be entirely unsatisfactory and frustrating for all concerned.Yet, if 155 million people could cast their votes in America even as Covid-19 was laying waste to society, is it really beyond us to declare that local democracy is important enough for us to go ahead with elections and to put arrangements in place that will protect both democracy and voters? The government could start by insisting that every returning officer in the land makes arrangements now for a 100 per cent postal ballot in every area. Those who prefer to vote in person could be assured that this is a one-off event and that they can vote however they please in future. A nation that has acquiesced in demands for social distancing and mask-wearing will hardly cavil at having to fill out a ballot paper in the privacy of their own homes.The arrangements for Wales and Scotland are theirs to make but there is nothing stopping them following suit. As for the campaign itself, will democracy really be fatally wounded if we don’t get the chance to slam our doors in the faces of tired-looking canvassers of a cold Saturday morning? However many doors I knocked during my tenure as an MP – and they were many – the most common criticism even the most active campaigning MP gets from constituents is “Well, you’ve never been at my door.” So a campaign in which door-to-door canvassing is ditched entirely in favour of phone canvassing or electronic communications would surely be welcome by all.And since the vast majority of the information we get about our local candidates and parties is gleaned from other media – TV, wireless and the internet – and since traditional campaigning techniques such as face-to-face contact are a dying art anyway, the new arrangement would be seen as an inevitable, even welcome, development.Having said all that, I fully accept that I am in a small minority of people who believe that local democracy actually is important – too important, in fact, to allow it to become yet another victim of lockdown. And I am chronically aware that most of my fellow citizens could not give a flying fox about whether votes are counted this May and vacancies on local authorities, city halls, police and crime commissions and devolved assemblies are filled. And that’s precisely why these elections must go ahead. The less we as a nation care about local elections, the less value we place upon those institutions and the less important democracy itself becomes. As the awful scenes we witnessed in Washington DC last night illustrate, democracy can be a fragile thing. It requires nurturing and attention, otherwise it withers. All that is needed is some common sense and someone to take decisions sooner rather than later.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"italian tourist destinations revolt plan build national nuclear","story":"Some of Italy’s most picturesque regions, including Tuscany and Sardinia, are in revolt against the government after it released plans to build a national dump for burying nuclear waste.The publication of a map of 67 potential nuclear dump sites – the culmination of a six-year study - prompted outrage and consternation from locals, mayors and regional leaders.Some of the earmarked sites are close to areas that are popular with British holidaymakers, from the rolling, wooded valleys of Tuscany to the countryside around Matera, the ancient town in the south that is famed for its cave-like dwellings and was used as a location for the latest Bond film, No Time To Die.The governors of the seven regions earmarked, including Tuscany, Puglia, Sardinia and Sicily, vowed to fight the nuclear deposit.They accused the government and SOGIN, Italy’s nuclear decommissioning agency, of failing to consult them.Italy closed down its nuclear power plants after a referendum in 1987, held in the wake of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The new deposit would store waste from those power plants as well as radioactive material that is still produced by industry, hospitals and research centres.Manolo Garosi, the mayor of Pienza, an attractive Tuscan hill town, said he was “incredulous” about the prospect of a nuclear dump being located in his region.The area includes vineyards and celebrated hill villages such as Montalcino and Montepulciano.“How can they be considering a region like ours, which has World Heritage recognition? It is totally unacceptable. This is an area of natural beauty,” he told Corriere della Sera newspaper.“I can’t imagine what tourists would say when they come here looking for beauty and discover instead radioactive waste dumps.” His town was famous for wine, olive oil and pecorino cheese, he said.The mayor of Matera said locating the dump near the historic town would be a “slap in the face,” particularly as it was a European City of Culture in 2019. “We’ll fight it at every level,” said Domenico Bennardi.More than 20 of the potential dump sites are in the northern part of Lazio region, famed for its Etruscan heritage, small villages and farmland.One of the sites is near the village of Gallese, where William Urquhart, a British businessman, helps run a country estate that his family has managed for more than a century.Part of it is a WWF nature reserve, boasting centuries-old oaks and the remains of Etruscan monuments.“It seems mad to choose an area of designated natural beauty for something like this,” he told The . “The government seems to have sprung this on the country out of the blue, in the middle of a pandemic in which people have become more conscious than ever of the importance of protecting the environment.“Of course no one wants buried nuclear waste where they live, but it needs to be an open, transparent process. Instead, it has come as a bombshell that will frighten a lot of people.”With lots of streams, ponds and ditches in the area, it seems “hydrologically, as well as culturally, environmentally and socially, a poor choice,” he said.The publication of the map of potential sites is the first stage in a long process that could last years.“Now that people have seen the list, they can participate in the process and express their views,” said Roberto Morassut, the deputy environment minister.The government said the deposit could bring benefits to a region – there will be 4,000 jobs during the construction phase and up to 1,000 jobs when it is operational.Planners need to find a site that will be able to hold 78,000 cubic metres of low and medium intensity radioactive waste, plus 17,000 cubic metres of more dangerous waste.The factors used for choosing the potential sites included the risk of volcanic and earthquake activity, the danger of flooding and the vicinity to inhabited areas. The 150-hectare facility will cost €900 million and take around four years to build.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"last night straw broke republicans backs","story":"The scenes in Washington DC looked eerily familiar to me. Back in 2000 a mob descended on the parliament building in Belgrade – which has a passing resemblance to Capitol Hill  - eventually forcing Slobodan Milosevic from power.I was forced to watch the action from afar, having been thrown out of the country along with a raft of other western journalists about a week before, as tension rose and mass street protests became a daily occurrence.Of course, this was the sort of thing one expected in a country which at the time could hardly be described as a mature democracy.Never did I think I would see such scenes unfolding in the capital of my adopted country which, so we are supposed to believe, cherishes democratic values so highly. Such assumptions have been ripped apart by Donald Trump since he lost the election. Even before the first vote was cast, he was crying foul and his complaints that the election was rigged have been relentless ever since.He was not short of allies on Capitol Hill who were more than happy to echo his allegations. The majority of the Republican caucus in the House of Representatives felt it politic to object to Joe Biden’s win, as did nearly a quarter of the party’s senators.Whether this was from conviction is a matter of debate. Given the power of the Trump base, it is not unreasonable to suspect that many fear a primary challenge the next time they are up for re-election.On Tuesday – just ahead of the congressional vote – Trump’s son Eric put the frighteners on, saying he would support anyone challenging any party lawmaker who accepted the Electoral College vote.Donald Trump’s ham-fisted – and legally questionable – attempt to persuade Georgia’s Secretary of State to “find” 11,780 votes must have raised alarm bells even among his most loyal supporters.And so it appeared, with an astonishingly forceful speech by Mitch McConnell, the party’s Senate leader who had defended Trump’s right to contest the result in the courts.“If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral,” he said. “We’d never see the whole nation accept an election again.”This was as powerful a repudiation of Trump from the party establishment as I have heard in years. The sentiments were expressed as Trump’s mob of supporters began its assault on Capitol Hill.Let us not forget that only days before, Trump had promised a “wild” protest against the “stolen election.”His speech was hardly an appeal to reason. We will never give up, we will never concede. It doesn\u0027t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved.As the mayhem unfolded, he tweeted just twice – on neither occasion condemning the assault on the heart of American democracy.Even when he released a video on Twitter urging people to go home, he reprised the grievances which had unleashed the mayhem in the first place.He appeared to accept no responsibility for the violence which saw members of Congress cowering in fear, an armed standoff at the door of the House of Representatives and his own vice-president having to be hustled away to safety.Trump has remained unrepentant, tweeting: “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously \u0026amp viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly \u0026amp unfairly treated for so long.”Urging the mob to “go home with love and in peace” he then told them to “Remember this day forever!”So not surprisingly people in Washington are now asking whether the US can survive even two more weeks of a Trump presidency.Several Democratic members of Congress are suggesting that the Cabinet should invoke the 25th Amendment and remove Trump from office as soon as possible.Given the political temperature, that is not surprising. But William Cohen, who was a Republican senator, has said the same thing. Even the National Association of Manufacturers has urged Mike Pence and the cabinet to intervene – a view which was retweeted by conservative columnist, Jonah Goldberg.Such calls are likely to become more widespread in days ahead and the case for action is becoming more persuasive.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mass oxford vaccine push begins gps deliver first doses","story":"GPs have begun administering the Oxford vaccine for the first time as the race to vaccinate the nation against coronavirus intensifies.In a bid to protect the 13.8 million most vulnerable people in the UK by mid-February, GPs have been instructed to prioritise Covid vaccinations over routine care. The British Medical Association told them to re-prioritise and postpone other activities.The first GP-administered Covid vaccine was delivered at the Pentland Medical Practice in Scotland. Every vaccine has so far been delivered in hospitals, but they will now be rolled out in hundreds of GP surgeries.  Ian Cormack was the first to be pictured getting the jab, and all the other patients among the first receiving the vaccine at Pentland are over 90.The first jab comes after the announcement on Wednesday that the daily death toll has topped 1,000 for the first time since April 21, with England\u0027s healthcare workers are having to contend with quickly filling hospital beds.On Monday January 4, a further 3,500 people were admitted to hospitals with coronavirus.GP vaccinations come as welcome news with hospital bosses being forced to find extra beds in the care and nursing home sector as wards fill up amid a surge in virus cases, Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said. Boris Johnson told the Commons on Wednesday: After the marathon of last year we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them. Every needle in the arm makes a difference.The Government aims to vaccinate all over-70s, front line healthcare workers and the most vulnerable by mid-February, which is when a review of the current lockdown rules will take place.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said that the Government and NHS are working around the clock to scale up the vaccination program.He said: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine can be transported easily, and I\u0027m delighted care home residents will begin receiving their first OxfordAstraZeneca jabs this week.This is the first step in the effort to mass vaccinate the most clinically vulnerable population in the UK in the battle against the new virus variant.Upwards of two million vaccines a week will need to be administered for the Government to hit its mid-February target.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock arrives gp surgery promote vaccine rollout no","story":"Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, faced questions about the supply of the Oxford vaccine after he visited a doctors\u0027 surgery to promote the national rollout only to arrive to find that doctors had not received a delivery.Mr Hancock was attending a photocall on Thursday morning as GPs began administering the vaccine for the first time, but the London surgery he visited had not received the Oxford product.The Bloomsbury Surgery, in central London, was expecting the first batch of the Oxford vaccine on Thursday morning but that has now been pushed back by 24 hours, Sky News reported.GP Ammara Hughes told the channel it was frustrating because the surgery has the capacity to inoculate many more patients, but said vaccine deliveries were ad hoc. She said: It seems like there\u0027s been a supply problem for getting that delivery.The doctor told the Health Secretary: We are willing, we are able – you get us the vaccines, and we will deliver.It is understood the practice was ready to vaccinate 400 people on Thursday, and has the capacity to administer 100 more. Dr Hughes said: We were expecting our first AstraZeneca 400 today, but we\u0027ve had a pushback for 24 hours so we\u0027re now getting that delivery tomorrow.It\u0027s just more frustrating than a concern, because we\u0027ve got the capacity to vaccinate, and if we had a regular supply we do have the capacity to vaccinate three to four thousand patients a week.We have been running since the middle of December, and on our busiest days we can vaccinate 500 people easily. If we could get the AstraZeneca, then we could easily vaccinate 500 a day, which would ease the pressure on the health service and we could get more and more people vaccinated quickly and hopefully get out of the pandemic.Mr Hancock said: It\u0027s great news this morning that the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine is from right now being rolled out to GP surgeries across the country.For the first three days with the Oxford vaccine we did it in hospitals to check that it was working well, and it\u0027s working well so now we can make sure that it gets to all those GP surgeries that like this one can do all the vaccinations that are needed.The rate-limiting step is the supply of vaccine. We\u0027re working with the companies, both Pfizer and AstraZeneca to increase the supply.GPs started administering the Oxford vaccine for the first time as the race to vaccinate the nation intensifies. Doctors have been instructed to stand down routine care and prioritise providing Covid vaccinations in a bid to ensure the NHS can deliver almost 14 million jabs by next month.   The first GP-administered vaccine was delivered to Ian Cormack in Scotland. Every jab up to now has been in hospitals.It comes as hospital bosses are being forced to find extra beds at care and nursing home sector as wards fill up amid a coronavirus surge, Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"schools closed new lockdown when reopen uk areas covid","story":"All primary and secondary schools have closed, after England moved into a third national lockdown.The Prime Minister said schools will need to offer remote learning until at least mid-February and GCSE and A-level exams face cancellation for a second year.Mr Johnson said the new measures were necessary: because we have to do everything we possibly can to stop the spread of the disease.Only vulnerable children and the children of key workers will be allowed to attend schools for face-to-face learning, and early years settings such as nurseries will remain accessible.The Prime Minister has promised that schools will be the very first things to reopen when lockdown measures begin to be removed, saying that this could come following the February half term. However, Mr Johnson remains very cautious about the timetable, with restrictions being lifted as a gradual unravelling. Those entitled to free school meals will continue to receive them during closures, and more devices will be distributed to help remote learning, according to Mr Johnson.The Government had insisted schools would remain open only a day before the new measures were announced, reassuring parents it was safe to send their children back for the start of term on Jan 4.But the move prompted backlash from four national teaching unions, who called for the delay seen across London to apply to all schools in England amid concerns the new strain of Covid-19 poses a threat to teachers.Anne Longfield, the Children\u0027s Commissioner for England has called for teachers to be vaccinated as a priority.The new lockdown measures mean the entire country will be subject to the same tougher measures, including the closure of all schools, meaning the tier system is not currently in place.Every school had been instructed to draw up plans to ensure children continue to receive an education even if they have to stay at home.Mr Johnson said on the announcement of closing schools: I want to stress that the problem is not that schools are unsafe to children. The problem is that schools may nonetheless act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households.Read more on the previous tier system: All schools will remain closed until mid-February, with the possibility that these measures could be extended further.This means most secondary school pupils will stay at home until at least February half term. Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, announced on January 6 that GCSE, A-Level and AS exams will not take place this summer. Exams will be replaced by teacher assessments, with Mr Williamson saying that the government will put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms. The Education Secretary has also stated that the Department for Education and Ofqual had already worked up a range of options. Details are currently being fine tuned, but it will be a form of teacher-assessed grades, with training and support provided to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently across the country.When schools reopened in September the Government published 25,000 words of guidance explaining how school children and staff should be kept safe.Older children will be encouraged to avoid close contact with one another, in part because risks increase with age. Teachers are not restricted to a single bubble, but are urged to stay at the front of any classroom to reduce contact. In class, pupils must sit spaced out side-by-side and facing forward.The use of the staff room by teachers is also meant to be “minimised”. Schools must contact local health protection teams immediately so those in close contact with the child can be traced. Currently, pupils in a bubble, year groups and very rarely, the entire school, could be asked to self-isolate. A mobile testing unit could also be sent to a campus. Schools will be offered serial testing of close contacts of staff and pupils who test positive to negate the need for entire year groups to self-isolate at home.Teachers who help a child with symptoms do not have to self-isolate unless they develop symptoms themselves. However, they should thoroughly wash their hands and wear PPE while with the child. The area where someone suspected of having Covid-19 has been must then be intensively cleaned.If a parent insists a child with symptoms should attend school, the headteacher can refuse to take the pupil if they believe there is a threat to others.Staff will also supply and promote the use of tissues as part of the “catch it, bin it, kill it” technique to control germs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel news covid test holidays flights uk restrictions ban","story":"The rules will apply to all travellers except BritishIrish nationalsWhat a new national lockdown means for travelCan I go on holiday?New UK entry testing rules: Everything you need to knowWill cruise holidays make a comeback in 2021?Sign up to the  Travel newsletterThe Government is set to ban arrivals from a number of southern African countries, plus the Seychelles and Mauritius, amid fears of the new South African strain of Covid-19 spreading across the continent.The  understands that all arrivals who have travelled to, or transited through Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, eSwatini, Zambia, Malawi, Lesotho, Mozambique, Angola, the Seychelles and Mauritius in the past ten days will be prohibited from entering the UK.The measure will be in place for a provisional two weeks, and apply to all travellers except BritishIrish nationals.Botswana, Mauritius and Seychelles will also be removed from the UK\u0027s travel corridor list from 4am on 9 January, along with Israel.This comes after the Government on December 23 banned entry for travellers who had been to, or transited through, South Africa in the previous ten days.

Indeed, if strict entry measures continue into the summer, holidaymakers heading to the likes of France and Spain may need to pay for a private test before departure and secure a test before returning to the UK.As holidaymakers have found out this year, securing a Covid-19 test for travel is a costly endeavour. In the UK, private tests generally run from £80 up to £300 for same-day results. There is some hope that the cost could come down as testing infrastructure continues to grow and companies become more competitive with their pricing, but even still it could prove prohibitive to many families hoping to get away.  Holiday companies could potentially build the cost of a return test into holiday packages, but no operator has announced plans to do this yet.Emma Beaumont has the story.Mass business collapses could be on the way as almost three in ten hospitality businesses warn they have little chance of survival beyond the first quarter of 2021.Four in ten food services and accommodation businesses had temporarily ceased trading in the crucial fortnight before Christmas, the Office for National Statistics found, with Covid rules severely limiting their ability to operate in much of the country.As a result, more than three-quarters said turnover was down compared with their usual expectations for the period.Tim Wallace has the full story.The swim-up bar: first seen at SandalsSuch was the familiarity of the Godfather of Jamaican and Caribbean tourism that everyone simply called him ‘Butch’. Gordon ‘Butch’ Stewart, who died on January 4, was an affable man, ebullient and immensely energetic, a giant in the tourism industry who would talk to anyone. He was a salesman and a great communicator, for his businesses and for Jamaica, and his influence stretched throughout the Caribbean and beyond. Butch Stewart had humble beginnings, raised on Jamaica’s north coast, but he was an entrepreneur from the start, and caught the wave of several Caribbean industries. In the 1960s he set up his first company, distributing and servicing air conditioners, then becoming popular on the island.This carried him through the Seventies, a difficult political and economic period in Jamaica, and his success and energy left him poised to ride the Caribbean wave of mass tourism in the Eighties. In 1981 he bought a tired hotel in Montego Bay and re-opened it as a Sandals resort. His vision was clear – as James Henderson discovers.The first Eurosceptic?Brexit is about places as well as people, events as well as attitudes.

You wake up well, said Po Yre, who took the remedy after he tested positive for Covid-19 in July.While there is no scientific evidence that the tea can combat the virus, Kayapó leaders have said all community members should drink it as a form of prevention against Covid, which has killed nearly 200,000 Brazilians, according to official figures.Villagers say it is the best way to keep the pandemic from wiping out indigenous communities, which they say have had limited support from the federal government.Health experts warn that the coronavirus pandemic endangers indigenous communities with limited or no access to healthcare in the Amazon and whose communal living makes social distancing difficult.Ski resorts in France had hoped they would be able to open lifts, many for the first time this winter, today – but their hopes have been slashed, Lucy Aspden reports.Secretary of State for tourism Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne told AFP that in light of a rather steep rise in terms of new (Covid-19) cases and intensive care admissions, the French government has decided to push back the reopening date of the nation\u0027s lifts.Prime Minister Jean Castex and Health Minister Olivier Véran are set to hold a press conference today at 6pm to confirm the decision and it\u0027s safe to say resort bosses are not happy with the prolonged closure.An empty Chamrousse ski resort, near Grenoble in the Belledone range“The Christmas holidays proved that the mountain resorts were organized to welcome holidaymakers in total health security. The practice of an inidual outdoor sport such as skiing does not present any specific risk,” read a joint statement from Jean-Luc Boch, president of France Montagnes  and President of the National Association of Mayors of Mountain Stations, Alexandre Maulin, president of Domaines Skiables de France and Eric Brèche, president of the National Union of French Ski Instructors.“Winter tourism represents 120,000 direct jobs and 10 billion euros in turnover. Without openness, it is not only companies and employees who will suffer the consequences, but also all of life and the inhabitants of our mountain regions. The consequences of a lack of openness risk being the final and irreversible destruction of our economic model,” continues the statement.If lifts stand still into February ski resorts look set to lose huge amounts of revenue. Statistics from France Montagnes reveal ski holidays in February contribute 35 per cent of the winter’s income, making it the most lucrative month of the year.Ali Shah, CEO of holiday booking site TravelUp, believes the introduction of a pre-departure testing requirement for all UK arrivals is long overdue. He says:It is incomprehensible to me why some of the poorest countries in the world were extremely quick to introduce mandatory testing, whilst the UK continues to have some of the most lax measures. In December, the Government launched the Test to Release scheme, which allows travellers to end self-isolation early should they get a negative coronavirus test five days after arrival. However, the system has been a disaster. The Government did not even provide a list of approved testing companies until the day the programme was introduced. Taking a test is also expensive with costs ranging from £60 to over £200.The Prime Minister has been hinting this week that he may introduce testing for UK arrivals. He needs to get a move on and do it. This is not a time for delay. We need urgent action and we need a comprehensive testing programme in place as soon as possible. We need testing to be widely available and for it to be cheap if not free.This new lockdown could not have come at a worse time for the travel industry. We were just starting to see some optimism return to the travel sector with people encouraged by the vaccine roll-out. Families were slowly starting to book summer holidays again and things were looking up after many months of misery. Decisive action now from the government can help to preserve the future for travel.The summer sale comes earlier than ever before, amid strong demand from holidaymakers looking to book trips far in advance.Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2 and Jet2holidays, said: “After much uncertainty, the positive news about a vaccine coupled with a real desire to get away, means we are seeing strong demand from holidaymakers wanting to plan and book future holidays.As always, we respond to what our customers and independent travel agency partners are telling us, so we have put Summer 22 on sale from all ten of our UK bases, meaning we’re on sale with our summer programme earlier than ever before.With sunshine favourites on sale, the scale of our programme means there is plenty of choice and flexibility for customers and independent travel agents to choose from with our award-winning airline and tour operator.With more good news around the corner, we’re sure that our Summer 22 programme will be a huge hit with local holidaymakers looking to secure a much-needed holiday and give themselves something to look forward to.”Japan\u0027s government has declared a month-long coronavirus state of emergency in the greater Tokyo area as the capital reported another record surge in daily infections.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga described a great sense of crisis as he announced the measure, which begins Friday and is less strict than the harsh lockdowns seen elsewhere or even the country\u0027s first virus emergency last spring.It primarily targets restaurants and bars, which will be asked to stop serving alcohol by 7 pm and close an hour later.Shinjuku district in JapanSuga made a special appeal to young people to abide by the requests, saying that more than half of recent new infections in greater Tokyo were among the under-30s.Please act... in order to save precious lives of your parents, grandfathers, grandmothers and friends, he said.Tokyo recorded 2,447 new cases on Thursday - shattering the previous record of 1,591 logged a day earlier, and representing a sizeable chunk of the 7,490 new cases reported nationwide.Still, Japan\u0027s outbreak remains comparatively small, with around 3,700 deaths overall.Rising infections has seen Ireland leapfrog the UK to become the country with the third highest seven-day case rate. The Czech Republic, which was praised for its handling of the pandemic last spring only to be hit harder than the rest of Europe in winter, tops the table.The countries with the highest Covid infection rateThe Government is expected to review its quarantine-free travel corridor list at 5pm, the first update since December 21, and a couple of destinations appear at risk.Cases have risen in the UAE and Barbados in recent weeks, pushing their seven-day infection rates to 131.6 per 100,000 residents and 129.4, respectively. While the UK\u0027s own rate is far higher (607.5), it has previously ditched countries that crossed the 100 barrier.Holidays are not allowed under lockdown rules but any changes will affect those already abroad or needing to travel for essential reasons. It would also bode ill for the prospects of post-lockdown trips. National Express will fully suspend its national network of scheduled coach services with effect from 23:59 on Sunday 10 January.Chris Hardy, managing director of National Express UK Coach: “We have been providing an important service for essential travel needs. However, with tighter restrictions and passenger numbers falling, it is no longer appropriate to do this.All journeys before Monday 11 January will be completed to ensure any passengers making essential journeys are not stranded and customers who\u0027s all customers whose travel has been cancelled will be offered refunds or amendments to journeys.We plan to be back on the road as soon as the time is right and have put a provisional restart date of Monday 1 March in place, added Mr Hardy.“The whole team at National Express worked incredibly hard throughout 2020 and I want to thank them for their efforts as we pause our services. We will now make sure we are ready to get back behind the wheel as soon as the nation needs us again.” There have been a further 1,718 cases of coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 163,234.Public Health Wales reported another 63 deaths, taking the total in Wales since the start of the pandemic to 3,801.The agency said a total of 49,428 doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been given in Wales, including 25 second doses, as of the week ending January 3.This weekend the world’s skiing elite will take to the slopes of St Anton am Arlberg, Austria. But while there will be no human spectators to watch the Arlberg Kandahar races – which include the international FIS women’s downhill and super-G World Cup competitions – a crowd of snowmen has been constructed by local children, to add some atmosphere to the Karl Schranz stadium.All proceeds from the sponsored snowmen will go to charityThey\u0026#39ll enjoy a front-row view of the Arlberg Kandahar racesRace fans can choose to sponsor a snowman for €100, with all money raised going to the CARITAS relief campaign, a sustainable water project in Africa.Prime Minister Boris Johnson will hold a Downing Street press conference at 5pm, alongside NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens.As it\u0027s Thursday, we are also expecting an update from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps on the UK\u0027s travel corridor list at 5pm. Though holidays are, of course, currently prohibited, any changes may impact essential travel – such as work trips and emergency journeys.Shapps usually announces any changes on his Twitter feed, but we\u0027ll have all the updates right here on the Travel Live Blog too.Hotelplan, which owns leading ski operators Inghams, Ski Total and Flexiski, has confirmed it is cancelling all ski holidays until after February 27.The group has already cancelled all holidays for the winter with its brand Esprit Ski.Following the announcement of new national lockdown restrictions, this week, we have sadly further suspended all Inghams, Ski Total and Flexiski holidays until after 27 February 2021,” said Joe Ponte, CEO of Hotelplan UK.  It’s still not clear when we will able to travel from the UK to European ski destinations, and understandably many people are eager to get back on the slopes. Our customers can remain assured that we are continuing to closely monitor the situation and when it is safe to do so, we will be ready to deliver the ski holidays people want.The move follows a similar decision by Crystal Ski Holidays, the UK’s biggest ski operator, which has suspended all trips up to and including February 12 – it is yet to make a decision on February half-term departures.What impact does the UK’s third national lockdown have on ski holidays? Our experts reveal all.Airline Aer Lingus is warning travellers from Britain and South Africa that those without a negative Covid-19 certificate will face a €2,500 fine or six months\u0027 imprisonment. The law will come into effect on January 9 – this Saturday. The airline\u0027s warning reads:All travellers are advised to check the requirements on the Government website.Holidaymakers arriving in Barbados may have to wear \u0027electronic tracking bracelets\u0027 until they are confirmed to be negative of Covid-19. This morning, the updated advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development office reads: If the result of that second test is negative, you will not be subject to further quarantine.It is thought the measure would enable health authorities to check whether holidaymakers are adhering to their self-isolation requirements. Whether British skiers and snowboarders will be able to travel restriction- or quarantine-free to the French Alps this winter remains to be seen. Additionally, while ski resorts have been open for other activities since mid-December, a decision on whether ski lifts in France will be allowed to open, many for the first time this winter, is yet to be made, with an announcement due this evening. Despite the uncertainty surrounding what fate President Macron will cast on ski lifts later today many resorts are still hopeful that by the spring there will be a chance to make fresh tracks.Lucy Aspden has the latest.The Home Secretary Priti Patel has told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that the UK Government will be announcing \u0027further action\u0027 regarding border restrictions imminently. Further action is going to take place, she told the programme. The Government is reviewing measures at the border... You will hear very shortly some of the changes that the Government will be proposing.Earlier this week, The  revealed that passengers would be prohibited from travelling to the UK without a negative Covid-19 test. However, the Government is yet to publish any details of its plans. We will, of course, have more on this story as it develops. Heathrow Airporthas reminded the public that \u0027only passengers undertaking essential travel may enter\u0027 its terminal buildings.That includes those who are travelling for essential reasons under the current lockdown legislation – as well as those offering care or assistance to travellers.Face coverings are also mandatory in terminal buildings, for all people over the age of 11. If you\u0027re thinking of booking a trip for later this year, take advantage of low flight prices while you still can, warns a spokesperson from travel agency Travelup: My strong advice is to book now, especially if you have a particular dream holiday or trip in mind. The prices can only go up. Once we are out of lockdown, the vaccine programme is rolled out more widely, and more travel corridors are opened up with testing, capacity is going to disappear pretty quickly. There is no point waiting to book nearer to departure time nowadays. Years ago there were low cost carriers, charters and scheduled airlines – and they were using different price matrixes. The low cost carriers would start off cheap and then get more expensive as you got closer to the departure date. The other airlines would reduce their prices to fill the empty seats. Now they all use the same model: they get more expensive. They all work on the basis that it’s the people who really need to travel who are booking so close to departure. So there is no point waiting any more.The boss of Norwegian Air has said the airline is \u0027fighting for survival\u0027 amid the coronavirus travel ban – with traffic down 94 per cent year-on-year. CEO  Jacob Schram said that just 130,000 passengers travelled on the airline in December 2020 – just 6 per cent of the passenger numbers in December 2019. The pandemic continues to have a negative impact on our business as it has had since March 2020, said Schram.At the beginning of last year, Norwegian was headed for a positive result in 2020 instead 2020, has been a very challenging year and we now find ourselves fighting for survival.The politan Police has said that officers will now be more inquisitive of people\u0027s behaviour and be quicker to act to engage rulebreakers. Police forces around the country would take similar approaches, Scotland Yard said.Over the past few weeks, officers have already turned long-distance day trippers away from beauty spots around the UK – including Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons. Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council (NPCC) said that police resources were not limitless and officers continued to prioritise their work, adding that it was really, really important that people followed the Government guidance.Canada will end its ban on flights from the UK on Wednesday, Transport Minister Marc Garneau has announced.The ban on UK flights, which was going until midnight tonight will lapse. It will no longer be applicable, Garneau told a press conference. The country prohibited flights from the UK on December 20, amid concerns over the new variant of Covid-19. In place of the ban, Canada has announced that all incoming travellers will be required to test negative for coronavirus within 72 hours of boarding a flight before being allowed into the country.Travellers will still be required to quarantine for 14 days on arrival.Book your holiday now or face potential disappointment, is the message from the travel industry. A spokesperson from Kuoni told  Travel: Many people will have gone for a year or more without an overseas holiday, so there’ll be a lot of hope pinned on summer 2021. January has always been a popular time to book as there are so many good savings, but this year it’s advisable to book sooner rather than later to guarantee you’ll get away to the spot you want.Before we begin, here\u0027s a quick recap of Wednesday\u0027s news:Passengers to be banned from boarding flights to UK without negative Covid testCruise sector in need of \u0027urgent\u0027 guidance from government Social media is full of celebrities on holiday in Dubai – are they above the law?Stansted to close terminal overnight after flight cancellations\u0027Vaccine passport\u0027 could become a requirement, says Fauci Now, on with today\u0027s stories.School closures in Covid lockdown: latest news on when they could reopenCoronavirus latest news: PM promises vaccine within 10 miles of your homeUS Capitol riots: Trump commits to peaceful transition after Biden certified as President - latest newsComment: Sad to say, but Trump and Covid combined have made a mockery of supposed Western superiorityHead of prestigious French university under fire for ignoring Duhamel rape claimsArthritis drugs that reduce risk of Covid death by 24 per cent to be given to ICU patients\u0026#39This is insurrection\u0026#39: Joe Biden\u0026#39s speech in full as US Capitol is stormedUS Capitol siege: Officials \u0026#39discuss 25th amendment to remove Donald Trump\u0026#39 as Republicans turn backs on presidentProud Boys and neo-Nazis: Who are the protesters who stormed the US Capitol?What is the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution and can it be invoked to remove Donald Trump from office?Washington stormed: How dark day for American democracy unfoldedAustralia launches review after it was revealed mystery £1.3bn transferred from the Vatican to AustraliaJake Angeli: The \u0026#39QAnon shaman\u0026#39 from Arizona at the heart of the Capitol riots Ashli Babbitt: Air Force veteran shot dead by plain clothes police during US Capitol riotsFour dead in US Capitol riot after Donald Trump\u0026#39s supporters storm Washington - everything we know Comment: Critics always claimed Trump had lost the plot - now they\u0026#39re finally rightInauguration Day 2021: When is Joe Biden sworn in as US president, and could it be behind closed doors?Saudi Arabia announces plans to build world\u0026#39s fastest rollercoaster in push to attract touristsSpeeding drivers to get letter warning of impact on environment Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vaccines minister needs military style approach lick fumbling","story":"The moment the Prime Minister decided to place a number of areas into Tier 4, it became a racing certainty that the rest of England would be in full lockdown by January. The nature of this new Covid variant has changed the terms of our response and I accept that the Government has had to take action even if I have deep concerns about aspects of the course it has chosen.However, it is clear the Government has now put all its eggs in the basket of the vaccine roll out. The way out for the country hangs on the role out of these jabs. The Prime Minister has rightly demanded of ministers and the NHS that they vaccinate the most at risk members of the public, some 13.4 million people, by the middle of February. That would require the Government to be vaccinating a minimum of 2 million people a week. This is an enormous task.  It is therefore entirely commendable that the PM has appointed a dedicated minister, Nadhim Zahawi, to oversee this task. It is especially welcome that he chose one with the useful experience of having run a global business before entering politics. Yet, even with those credentials, Mr Zahawi knows that to achieve the the task set by the Prime Minister he will have to have the most robust of institutional structures and the powers necessary to overcome the normal inertia, particularly that occurs between government departments.This must be treated as a military operation. He must be clear what the real objective is and make it clear that each person must understand this, all the way down the chain. Maintenance of the Objective, a principle that Mr Zahawi would do well to borrow from the military, cannot be forgotten and an assessment of whether the roll-out is on track but must be made daily. To that end, it is good that 101 Logistics Brigade are now embedded in the process. The military bring key command and control skills, an area in which the Civil Service is typically poor. The main problem is that Civil Servants don’t by nature tend to meet targets. They typically end up giving ministers overly optimistic objectives and then later reporting back failure once it\u0027s already too late. This is because once they set a goal, they often then leave it to those tasked with carrying out inidual assignments to report back up. Without critical interrogation along the way, problems get hidden and the targets get missed. Examples of this are endless but the test-and-trace app would be one recent example.Mr Zahawi will need, on his desk every evening, a report direct from each area of command, town and district. These will be compiled by the contract managers whose responsibility it is to deliver their area. This report should include their targets for that day and week and whether they are on track to meet their broader targets. If they are off, then they must report what they are doing to get back on track. Two days of missed targets should trigger urgent intervention. It is this feature most of all that should occupy his daily meetings. If medical centres are going to be used to organise vaccinations and call people in, then the deliveries of the vaccine must be there on time, otherwise chaos ensues.As the PM has put him in charge, he must have the power to demand that inidual Secretaries of State account to him for their compliance with the plan. The PM will need to work hand in glove with him on this. Inidual departments must not be allowed to drag their feet or have other priorities. Perhaps the best example of where this has already occurred is the delay in getting retired doctors and nurses in to carry out the jabs. The NHS has known about the ridiculous amount of compliance these people were being put through, yet dragged their feet on resolving the issue until this week. The revelation that PHE staff were not planning to work seven days a week, a situation that has since been corrected.On top of that, there is a long list of organisations that need to be on board in the role out. Pharmacies, with pre-existing venues and skills in administering vaccinations. Could coffee shops, pubs or even schools, closed now but with easy access and refrigeration, be used as sites for vaccines? They could even use Job Centres, as the authorities have in Israel, drive-in centres and mobile vaccination units. However, the issue which has the capacity to derail the objective is that of supply. There is some evidence of a problem in the supply of glass vials where there seems to be a shortage. The vaccine manufacturers deny this and say they are on track to meet the need for two million doses a week, but it isn’t certain when that will be. In time for 13.4 million to be vaccinated by mid-February? If so, that means next week.The simple truth, and what may prove to be the Government\u0027s greatest headache, is that I don’t think 2 million vaccinations a week will be enough. I suspect that it will need to be at least three million on a reducing timescale. If such a compression of the timetable takes place, there needs to be a back-up plan to cover it. From production to inoculation, the potential to scale up must be there, including 24 hour vaccinations.Urgency is the key and to that end Nadhim Zahawi should insist that everyone in government, from the Prime Minister down, should now have on their desk a note saying: Action this Day!More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube censorship symptom corrosive philosophy","story":"YouTube\u0027s Medical Information Policy is worth a read. The site has a virtual monopoly of video streaming in much of the world. Its censors are more powerful and less accountable than most governments. YouTube says its policy is to take down content that contradicts WHO or local health authority guidance about Covid-19. It recently took down the channel run by TalkRadio, because it has given a platform to lockdown and vaccine sceptics.Included in the list of things that YouTube will ban are content that claims that any group or inidual has immunity or disputes the efficacy of local health authorities\u0027 or WHO\u0027s guidance or alleges that social distancing and self-isolation are not effective in reducing the spread of the virus. Explaining its decision to ban TalkRadio, YouTube said that it objected to content that explicitly contradicts expert consensus.This is dangerous twaddle, and it is not confined to internet platforms.The Royal Society, Britain\u0027s premier scientific society, has proposed legislation and punishment of those who produced and disseminated false information about vaccines.Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, of the politan Police, who is responsible for counter-terrorism, has questioned whether it was the correct thing for society to allow the dissemination of misinformation.I am not an anti-vaxxer. Some of the arguments of the anti-vaxxers deserve an answer. Most of them are absurd. None is convincing. However, I have to remind myself, as we all should, that every proposition in science is provisional. It reflects the current state of knowledge, experience and opinion. Once upon a time, the consensus of experts was that the sun moved around the Earth, that blood did not circulate around the body, and that Dr Jenner, the pioneer of vaccination, was a quack. On many issues, science does not speak with one voice. The scientific consensus eight months ago was that masks were useless and possibly dangerous. Now it is that they are essential. There are reputable scientists advising the Government, and others who regard the Government\u0027s measures as scientifically indefensible.Dissent is fertile. Science advances by confronting contrary arguments, not by suppressing them. The objection to the growing appetite for censorship is not just scientific. It is also moral and political. YouTube\u0027s ban on TalkRadio was quickly reversed, and did not reflect government policy.But the important point is that the ban was imposed in support of government policy. YouTube\u0027s definition of acceptable opinion is opinion that does not overtly challenge views of public authorities.A century and a half ago, John Stuart Mill, the great Victorian apostle of liberalism, warned that the main danger to liberty came not from the state but from our fellow citizens. It came from social pressure to conform and from collective intolerance of unsettling ideas.In the current crisis, it comes mainly from fear. It is fear that drives people to surrender basic civil liberties to the state in return for what they hope will be a measure of protection from illness or death. It is the same fear that makes them angry with other people who disagree. Because the pressure for mass coercion comes from below, it quickly slides into intolerant demands for the suppression of dissent in the name of social solidarity. These are the authentic symptoms of totalitarianism.Anger and fear are enemies of truth.Perhaps the ugliest example is the slander implicit in the YouTube policy that opponents of lockdown are Covid-deniers, fantasists or fools. Most of them do not deny the gravity of the pandemic and understand perfectly well what is at stake. But they believe that there are better ways of dealing with it and that in the longer term, the economic and social effects of the Government\u0027s countermeasures will be worse. A rational society would take these points on board.Ultimately, the approach of YouTube is based on submission to authority. They demand respect not just for the law but for the values, opinions and priorities of the state. This reflects a view of society as a great collective, which must have a single collective notion of the public good. On this view of the world, dissent is inherently anti-social, even treasonable. It is a widely held view, but profoundly corrosive. If our civilisation is to survive, a great philosopher once wrote, we must break with the habit of deference to great men great men may make great mistakes.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"7 times tories cosied up","story":"News times Tories cosied up to Donald Trump despite the warning signsTory Priti Patel has said the Presidents comments directly led to violence at the Capitol.

Fourteen days before he is booted from office, he reached a new low by telling Capitol rioters “we love you”. The President’s baseless claims the election was stolen from him earned a rebuke from the UK. Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, said Trump’s comments “directly led to the violence” by his supporters in Washington. She told the BBC: “So far he’s failed to condemn that violence, and that is completely wrong.”  Ms Patel’s condemnation was notable partly because it is so rare. In the past her fellow Tory ministers and backbenchers have cosied up to the President to win his favour - despite warnings at the time about his character.Even on Wednesday night, when he condemned the violence via Twitter, Boris Johnson made no mention of Donald Trump. Ms Patel insisted Britain should look forward, not backwards, as Joe Biden enters the White House.“The fact of the matter is they are now transitioning to a new President,” she said. “This isn’t about going back and reflecting on personal relationships.” But for the sake of argument, what would we findwe did  Here are seven times Tory MPs were more friendly than they needed to be to the US President. Boris Johnson suggested he should get the Nobel Peace Prize  The Prime Minister used to be blunt about Donald Trump. In  he accused him of “stupefying ignorance” for saying parts of London “are so radicalised that the police are afraid for their own lives”. Perhaps for diplomatic reasons, Mr Johnson cooled off on the criticism when both men were in government. But critics say he went too far in trying to appease the President - who lavished praised on him and called him aposBritain Trumpapos. As Foreign Secretary  he even suggested Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize. He said: “If he can fix North Korea and the Iran nuclear deal then I don’t see why he’s any less of a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize than Barack Obama, who got it before he even did anything.” The PM of course had history with Barack Obama - who he branded “part-Kenyan” and accused of an “ancestral dislike of the British empire” in . As he hoped for a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, the PM repeatedly stopped short of criticising Trump directly, even in his worst controversies - and even when it was clear he had lost the  election.Needless to say, the much-hoped-for Brexit trade deal with the US hasn’t materialised yet.Michael Gove posed with his thumbs up  Michael Gove, rather than a full-time journalist, won the first UK interview with Trump after his election.It later emerged Rupert Murdoch had sat in the room, amid claims the newspaper mogul had a hand in setting up the meeting. The write-up in The Times praised the incoming President’s intelligence, saying: “Mr Trump’s number-rich analysis of defence spending reflects a businessman’s ability to cut through jargon to get to the essentials of a case.” Mr Gove also called Trump “the master of the profit and loss accounts” and a “determined negotiator”, and they talked about their shared Scottish heritage. The interview asked Trump about his ‘Muslim ban’, which he’d stood by weeks earlier, but the answer didn’t make it into the final edit of Mr Gove’s write-up. To cap it all, the Tory MP then posed with the President-elect with his thumbs up. Unfortunately for him the friendly tactics didn’t work - as when he ran for Tory leader two and half years later, Trump said: “I don’t know him”. Jacob Rees-Mogg said he would vote for him Now Commons Leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg repeatedly sprang to Trump’s defence as a backbencher.Asked in he would vote for Trump, he replied: “I would almost certainly vote RepublicanI were in America.” That was nine months after the President demanded a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States”. Two years later Mr Rees-Mogg urged MPs to “lay out the reddest of red carpets” for the President and “treat him with the greatest respect and courtesy.” He also took up Trump’s claim that he was America’s ‘Mr Brexit’. In a  article headlined ‘President Trump will be our greatest ally after Brexit’, Mr Rees-Mogg wrote: “His election depended upon similar factors to those that led to Brexit. “He appealed to voters left behind by the metropolitan elite and he exudes confidence about his own nation and a determination not to be a manager of decline, which also inspires the Brexiteers.” Andrew Rosindell tweeted support even after the election  The Tory MP for Romford gave fuel to Trump’s baseless ‘voter fraud’ claims with an image he tweeted the day after the US election. The MP’s account shared a crude meme showing Trump as the American Eagle, wrestling back the flag from Biden who was depicted in the form of communism rising from the dead. It happened after Trump went on TV to demand legal votes stop being counted. Andrea Jenkyns had a nodding Trump toy The Tory MP for Morley and Outwood didn’t hold back in her enthusiasm for the US President. When he was mooted for the Nobel Peace Prize she tweeted: Surely even critics of @realDonaldTrump can recognise his good work in this area.” She shouted youaposre welcome Mr President! down from her office window at anti-Trump protesters while playing with a nodding-head toy of the President during his June  visit to the UK. We should roll out the red carpet and welcome President Trump, she said at the time.And she urged him to win the election after he was struck down with coronavirus.Of course wishing his good health is what any sensible person would do. But urging him to win the election, two days after he refused to condemn white supremacists in a TV debate, is a little dferent. Philip Davies said ‘he is not a serious threat of harm’  Shipley MP Philip Davies is another backbencher who was enthusiastic about the US President in the past. In , after the President called for a ban on Muslims entering the US, MPs debated banning Trump from entering the UK in retaliation. But Mr Davies insisted: He is not a serious threat of harm to our society in any way. The uproar is largely because he is rich, white and politically incorrect, and that, to me, is really the crux of the issue. He added: “Lots of my constituents agree with what Donald Trump said, whether I like it or not. [Should they] be expelled from the country as a result of their views ” In the same year he added: “I think that we should celebrate politicians who stand up and say things that are unpopular and controversial.” Theresa May invited him for an instant State Visit "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus live lockdown updates uk","story":"NewsCoronavirus UPDATES: NHS chief slams Covid hoax claims as insult putting lives at riskPrime Minister Boris Johnson made his third TV address of the week on the coronavirus pandemic today, outlining the Armys role in the vaccine roll-out, describing Trump as completely wrong and slamming Covid deniers as needing to grow upmirrorShareByJoseph WilkesReporterUpdated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video boris-johnson-pledges-covid--,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Speaking to MPs, Mr Hancock talked about the four criteria that the government will look at before deciding on when they can end the lockdown.Ministers have said that they plan to end the lockdown in late February - but others, including Michael Gove,have suggested it could drag on into March.Mr Hancock told MPs: Weaposve set out the conditions that weaposll look at for the relaxation of the restrictions. Those are, that there isnapost another major, new iant that is causing dficulties. The vaccination program is working, and the number of hospitalisations and deaths is coming down.The Health Secretary said there were no fixed thresholds for any of the key criteria - but stressed ministers were always looking at the direction deaths and hospitalisations are travelling. The warning came as he insisted - despite the governmentaposs catalogue of errors - that this will be the last national lockdown.It came as Mr Hancock said people may need to be revaccinated every six months in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus.Mr Hancock said: “I anticipate we will probably need to revaccinate because we don’t know the longevity of the protection from these vaccines. “We don’t know how frequently it will be, but it might need to be every six months, it might need to be every year.” Askedhe thought this would be the “last of the lockdowns” because of the vaccines, Mr Hancock said: “I do, yes.” Mr Hancock also said that Covid- vaccines that require adjustments to fight new iants of the virus may not need to go through the usual full trials process. It came as Public Health England confirmed that case rates in England are  rising among all age groups. The Health Secretary also warned that the number of people in hospitals may not fall as quickly as death rates once the vaccine is rolled out as a result of the number of younger adults with the virus. He said Hospitalisation levels I would also expect to fall, but ironically not as quickly as deaths in the first instance. “The reason is that people that are slightly younger spend longer in hospital, often because they survive when somebody who is very old and frail might not survive for as long.” "},{"url":null,"title":"no10 three press conferences week","story":"NewsNo to do three press conferences a week - but White House-style briefings delayedPlans to televise daily lobby briefings had been scheduled to start this month, led by the PMs new press secretary Allegra StrattonmirrorShareCommentsByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN NewsRegular No press conferences willnext week\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

He said Hospitalisation levels I would also expect to fall, but ironically not as quickly as deaths in the first instance. “The reason is that people that are slightly younger spend longer in hospital, often because they survive when somebody who is very old and frail might not survive for as long.” On vaccines, he added: “As with the flu vaccine each year, for a type of vaccine that has been clinically trialled and approved,you make small adjustments to it, then it may not need the full year-long trials process that a new vaccine needs. “That, of course, is a decision for the independent MHRA.” He added: “The way I have described it, isyou are lucky to have Range Rover and you get a new wing mirror stuck on it, it’s still a Range Rover and should be classied as such. “In the same way,you make a small change to a vaccine it’s essentially a regulatory clinical decision as to whether that needs to go through the full panoply of the full three phases of clinical trials Mr Hancock also warned that the number of people in hospitals may not fall as quickly as death rates once the vaccine is rolled out.

The Health Secretary said it was “great news” that the jab could be delivered to family doctors from today to hit a target of inoculating million by February . But the Bloomsbury Surgery in Camden, north London, had not received its delivery of the new vaccine when he visited. GP Ammara Hughes told Sky News: “We were expecting our first AstraZeneca  today, but weaposve had a pushback for  hours so weaposre now getting that delivery tomorrow. She added: “Itaposs just more frustrating than a concern, because weaposve got the capacity to vaccinate andwe had a regular supply, we do have the capacity to vaccinate three to four thousand patients a week.  We have been running since the middle of December, and on our busiest days we can vaccinate  people easily. If we could get the AstraZeneca, then we could easily vaccinate  a day, which would ease the pressure on the health service. “And we could get more and more people vaccinated quickly and hopefully get out of the pandemic. It is thought the practice had not been due to give the Oxford jab from today, because it already had supplies of the Pfizer jab, but could still prove embarrassing to the top Tory.Ministers have insisted they can ramp up from around , vaccines per week to , per day to meet Boris Johnson ’s target. Speaking outside the surgery, Mr Hancock said the “rate-limiting step” was how fast the two jabs could be produced by the firms Pfizer and AstraZeneca. It was not clearhe knew about the Oxford jab delay to that surgery at the time. He told reporters: “The manufacturers are doing a brilliant job and they’re delivering to the schedule that’s agreed. “But that schedule is the amount of vaccine that we have, and that’s what GPs will now be delivering. “The good news is that from today the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine can be delivered by GP practices right across the country.“That means we’ll be able to get more vaccine out to more people more quickly and get everybody who’s vulnerable to this disease the offer of a vaccine by the middle of next month”. Boris Johnson has pledged to vaccinate the four top priority groups - including all over-s, shielders, care home residents and NHS and care staff - by February . There will be  GP-led centres and  hospital sites open by the end of this week, No said, plus seven ‘super’ centres next week. The government is trying to speed up the approval process by which the MHRA regulator has to pass each batch before it goes out. Public Health England is not currently taking ‘routine’ orders of the jab to hospitals on Sundays, but says it can step up and do so at any time. It came as figures showed , people tested positive for Covid- in England in the week to December .

This week the mum of a young baby has warned other parents to be on the lookout for symptoms which can be mistaken for ailments of a common sickness bug or teething in tots. Myer Rudelhoff said her four-month-old son George spent three nights in Basildon Hospital in Essex after suffering from vomiting, patchy skin, swelling lips and a high temperature. The poorly tot also struggled to keep fluids down. Myer said: He got so poorly so quickly when we arrived and was really lethargic. They took a swab and, when they said he was positive, I burst into tears. It was such a shock. Nurses treating George said nurses told her they had treated multiple children with the same mottled skin and sickness before encouraging her to share her story to warn other parents.  Lucy Fisher, from Hertford, also shared photos of her -month-old son Albie with mottled skin after he tested positive for the virus. Images of Albie show the youngsteraposs mottled skin, with his neck flushed and covered in a rash. Another photograph shows a teary-looking Lucy with Albie cuddled into her chest sleeping.The -year-old listed her sonaposs symptoms in a Facebook post on Monday [ Jan] as a warning to other parents, saying: “This is without a doubt the hardest week I’ve faced being a mum. Last month, Tim Spector, lead scientist on the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app and Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King’s College London, said as a new strain of the virus causes a spike in infections across the country people should not just focus on the three main symptoms and look for other signs.He said: Testing alone is not going to stop the spread, just as it didn’t with the previous waves. People need to know all the symptoms and not just focus on the three “official” symptoms that miss over  per cent of cases . If anyone is suffering from any of theseover the coming weeks, stay at home, self isolate and get a test. Stomach ache The American Journal of Gastroenterology published a study suggesting the virus could cause digestive problems such as diarrhoea. It analysed data from  patients in China, discovering that . per cent of them had tummy issues such as vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhoea when they were first hospitalised. Teenager Daraposyana Dyson, from Maryland, Baltimore, US, died from a coronavirus-related inflammatory condition after suffering an upset stomach alongside other symptoms.The -year-oldaposs mum Kandace Knight told WBAL-TV : It happened so fast. I never thought that taking my daughter to the hospital for a stomach pain that I wouldnapost be walking out of there with her. She was so beautul, she was too good for this world. Eye infections Health officials think conjunctivitis develops in around % to % of patients, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Chy Earnest, a nurse at the Le Care Centre in Washington, said that red eyes are the ‘single most important’ sign that patients have COVID-. Speaking to CNN she explained: “They have, like...allergy eyes. The white part of the eye is not red. Itaposs more like they have red eye shadow on the outside of their eyes.” However, the American Academy of Ophthalmology said this does not mean you should panicyou see someone with apospink eyeapos. FatigueA WHO study looking at common signs found that the third most common symptom of coronavirus was a aposflatliningapos feeling of fatigue. Some . per cent of patients reported the symptom in the study, which was based on , laboratory confirmed cases.Researchers previously described fatigue as one of the aposdark horses of Covid symptomsapos, alongside headaches.Using data from the COVID Symptom Study app, the researchers created a list of the most common symptoms reported by patients in the first seven days after onset.  Brain fog aposBrain fogapos is usually a symptom associated with aposlong Covidapos but some patients also experience it before being diagnosed with the disease.Thea Jourdan told The Daily Mail that she first thought she may have been infected when she got a tickle in her throat and a headache.The mum-of-three said: I also had brain fog. I was unable even to fill out forms from the children’s schools. I just wanted to sleep, while trying to keep the kids safe and away from my quarantine area — my bedroom. Dr Hilary Jones said those who do experience the side-effect will be faced with a crippling inability to think clearly. Confusion Dr Halim Fadil, a neurologist at Texas Health Arlington Memorial Hospital, told Healthline : “Many COVID- patients have been reported to have neurological symptoms, such as headache, confusion, seizures, and even strokes.”Delirium usually affects patients who require ventilator support, and is caused by a build-up of carbon dioxide in the body. Neurologist Dr Kevin Conner explained: “Patients with delirium may have auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, disorientation of time and space, agitation, aggression, fluctuating level of consciousness, and impairment of sleep-wake cycle.” Worryingly, delirium can lead to long-term brain damage, while patients who experience it are also less likely to survive, according to the experts.  Skipping mealsProfessor Spector said data from the Covid Symptom Tracker App has revealed that the top five symptoms in children aged under  who tested positive for the virus are headaches, fatigue, fever, sore throat and skipping meals.Speaking on BBC Inside Science, Prof Spector said: These are dferent from the top five we see in adults which includes generally the cough and the shortness of breath and the loss of smell. That’s really important to realise - skipping meals and fatigue are really important, as are headaches.s. Prof Spector has encouraged parents to sign up to the app on behalf of their children.  Muscle pain New York University researchers found a link between sore muscles and serious coronavirus cases during an analysis of  patients in Wenzhou, China. Professor Megan Coffee, the infectious-disease expert who led the study, said deep muscle soreness, known as myalgia, were often exhibited by patients. The World Health Organization said aches or joint pain came up in around  per cent of coronavirus patients. The soreness is caused by chemicals called cytokines being released into the body in response to the infection, according to The Sun.

Sky Diamonds are created by sucking carbon out of the atmosphere which gets turned into eye-catching stones.

Whether we’re talking burgers, cars or football - and now diamonds.Some years ago, I was thinking about the concept of geoengineering - how to extract carbon from the atmosphere. That led me to think about how to store that carbon, and to the simple thought that the most permanent, enduring form of carbon – the toughest of all – is a diamond.  I wonderedit might be possible to take carbon out of the atmosphere and turn it into diamonds. I loved the idea, and not just as an environmentalist it’s radical and evocative – it’s modern day alchemy. So we pursued it. It took few years but we’ve done it.

Was it just me who cheered when they saw the photos of them being apprehended by police  AT LAST.What do you think  Let us know in the commentsHow traumatic for the poor boy forced to watch his father be arrested. What a terrible example to set your child. Instead of teaching him that we must all act together, for other people, for society, for the future generation, he was dragged along in the freezing cold to watch his dad punished for doing what is clearly the wrong thing. The news that these dangerous, selfish fools – and other rule-breakers like them – are going to face consequences couldn’t have come at a better time. This isn’t just the right thing legally, it’s the right thing for the morale of the country. What we’re doing to try to halt the spread of the virus, to prevent the collapse of the NHS, only workswe all do it. Every single restriction flouter makes the sacrices everybody  is suffering pointless.It’s been infuriating for those who have stuck to the rules to see others doing as they please and getting away with it. Well, not any more, thank goodness. Knowing everyone is doing their bit, and in the same boat, is the only thing that makes the struggles we are currently enduring bearable. At a time when the world feels particularly harsh and unfair, finally a bit of justice.

The Margaret Beavan school in Liverpool dates back to the th century, when, before it was opened as a school in , it had been originally built as a Victorian Mansion called Eddesbury.The Grade II listed building was given its name in  after Margaret Beavan, the unmarried aposlittle mother of Liverpoolapos who became the city’s first female Lord Mayor and bought the manor from the former owner Danson Cunningham, converting it into a school educating disabled children, reports Liverpool Echo.But after it was shut down in , it has since fallen into disrepair.

It is understood the building was sold in July  and is now in private hands, but little or no work has been carried out on it.

Parents who work in key worker sectors are permitted to send their children to school - while all others have been told to keep children to engage in remote learning. However, some parents and teachers have claimed schools are dramatically busier than the first closure during lockdown one earlier this year. Some key workers have said they have even been denied a place for the child as classrooms fill up during the UKaposs third lockdown.Victoria Pass told the Manchester Evening News said: I’m a frontline NHS worker and been declined by my child’s school. Now I’m questioning whether to go to work or stay at home and not help save lives because my children need me.A teaching assistant has also been refused spaces for her children because her partner isnapost a key worker, yet he still has to work - leaving her unable to teach at her own school. While mental health worker Ewa Fcia said her son didnapost get a place at school because she works remotely from home - but sheaposs unable to do whataposs required when heaposs there. I work in mental health in the NHS. As it’s not physical health I work remotely from home, she said. Because I work from home my son didn’t get a place in school. However, it is not possible to do any kind of therapy with anyone with a four-year-old at home as he will interrupt any appointments that I will have via video link with patients. I will struggle to see patients as I normally do now. How is that protecting NHS services  Others spoke of how much busier schools are compared with the last lockdown, with some now choosing to keep them home because of the numbers. Among them is Katie Cowley, a teacher who lives in Rochdale, who said some parents at her childrenaposs school had been outside apostalking about what a lovely day they have had at home with no childrenapos.  She said: I was amazed at the amount of children in when I dropped mine off. As a teacher myself I have no choice but to send them in, I am genuinely worried for their safety and may now decide not to send them in, I am so worried for them and myself. aposI donapost need full time provision, there are times when I could keep my children at home and successfully fulfil my duties as a teacher and parent, but to access that provision I have to send mine in full time. Kirsty Frances is also concerned over the number of children, saying: I work in school kitchens and have to put both my kids in school so I can be in work. Iaposve seen my childrenaposs school have to turn people away already but thereaposs far too many kids already in. And Jo Harrow said she hoped schools were checking for proof of key worker status. I hope to god schools are asking for letters from employers to ensure they are genuine, she said. I know my sonaposs school had a number of people taking advantage last time and it’s not fair. The increase in demand is in part due to an expansion of the list of critical workers and vulnerable children entitled to a space.For example, the aposvulnerable children and young peopleapos list now includes aposthose who may have dficulty engaging with remote education at home apos. Teaching unions today raised concerns, with one heads’ union reporting that some schools have had  per cent of their families requesting on-site provision. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the school leaders’ union NAHT, said: We’re increasingly concerned about the sheer demand for key worker and vulnerable pupil places this week. Our members are telling us that demand for places is much higher than it was during the first lockdown last spring. We’ve heard stories of some schools having - per cent in. This could seriously undermine the impact of lockdown measures, and may even run the risk of extending school closures.” Another mum suggested that perhaps parents wouldnapost be so keen to send their children to schoolthey were happy with the remote learning being provided - something thataposs proved somewhat of a lottery for families depending on what their childaposs school is offering.  Catherine Ibison said: Maybe because they know the effect that this is having on their children’s education and they want them to be taught. Not to be given an online class on a mobile app that they have to work from PowerPoint on with no teacher availablethey get stuck. I wonder how many teachers have tested this and see the end user experience . She added: How have all schools not adapted for true virtual learning by now when they have had  months to nail it ! Why have some schools not embraced Zoom and only using it for assembly and not classes. Maybe that’s the reason! Sort the virtual learning out and more parents may have the confidence that their children are indeed getting an education! The issue was raised at Mayor Andy Burnhamaposs weekly press conference on Wednesday. Asked whether he supported the decision of some schools to limit spaces to children with two key worker parents, he said schools need to be trusted to make their own judgements.

A mass inoculation of the Oxford AstraZeneca Covid- vaccine began today as hospitals across the country face rising numbers of seriously ill patients. The vaccines are being delivered to sites all over the UK after the Government committed to offering the vaccine to more than  million people in the top four priority groups by mid-February. It comes as NHS trusts in London are on the verge of being overwhelmed, according to leaked health service documents, while other trusts are rapidly turning normal wards into intensive care units . There have also been reports that dozens of people have failed to turn up for their jab slots for the Pfizer vaccine. In Brighton, pictures this morning showed large queues as lines of people waited to get access to the new jab, seen as a aposgame-changerapos in the fight against the disease and offering ato normality.Harold Millington, , of Chaddesden, Derby, became the first person to be vaccinated at Derby Arena as people came in their droves to get inoculated.Recent figures showed that there were , people in UK hospitals with coronavirus, much higher than the April  peak of ,.Rupert Pearse, professor of intensive care medicine and a consultant at the Royal London, said his own ICU staff were having to care for far more sick patients as he urged the public to heed the aposstay at homeapos lockdown message.  He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme there would usually be one fully-trained ICU nurse to one ICU patient but staff were becoming increasingly stretched. He said: Right now we are diluting down to onenurse to threeand filling those gaps with untrained staff and in some instances doctors helping nurses deliver their care... and weaposre even facing diluting that further to one in four. As intensive care doctors, weaposre not sure how we can together deliver the quality of care that we need to.  Speaking on behalf of the Intensive Care Society, he said the problems were not just in London, but in other hospitals across the UK, and were not limited to ICU wards. He added: We are really very concerned now about the seriousness of the situation... which is definitely worse than the first wave and proving much harder to deal with now as the resources we had in the first wave arenapost available to us. So weaposre really struggling to provide the quality of patient care that we think patients deserve. And the impact of the pandemic is taking care away from other illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. In essence, the healthcare available to all of us is not as good as it should be right now. Prof Pearse said that unless people take the lockdown seriously the impact on healthcare across the country could be catastrophic. It comes amid reports that despite efforts to roll out the Pfizer medicine,  people aged over  have missed their scheduled vaccination appointment at a single surgery in Kent. A spokesperson said that fortunately other patients took their place and none of the vaccine was wasted. According to a Zoom presentation seen by the Health Service Journal , hospital capacity in London will not be enough for the expected rise in patients in the coming weeks. NHS England Londonaposs region medical director Vin Diwakar set out stark predictions to the medical directors of the capitalaposs hospital trusts on a call, the HSJ reported.  The data showed eventhe number of Covid patients grows at the lowest rate considered likely, and measures to manage demand and increase capacity, including opening the capitalaposs Nightingale hospital, are successful, the NHS in London will be short of nearly , general and acuteand intensive care beds by January . The first community vaccinations against coronavirus with the Oxford AstraZeneca jab are taking place in GP surgeries today and about , sites are expected to be delivering vaccines by the end of the week. The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is said to be easy to administer as it can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, unlike the Pfizer jab which requires storage at minus C. Seven mass-vaccination centres will also open next week in London, Newcastle, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Surrey and Stevenage.

Itaposs been a really tough year for him. Most people make adjustments to their lives slowly but for him everything just went at once. A source close to the couple apparently reveals how they feel one year on from telling the world they were leaving royal le. Meghan and Harry took a huge leap of faith to embark on their new le, the source told the magazine. The year started out with a lot of excitement and anticipation. Harry was finally doing what he’d wanted to do for years, and to have Meghan and Archie with him was all he could have asked for.  The insider added: Despite everything that has been going on this year, they don’t regret their move to the US they love that they are able to focus on projects and causes that are important to them. Harry and Meghan left the UK back in March, just as the coronavirus pandemic started to affect the country.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their plans to step back as senior royals, last year saying they wanted to become financially independent and split their time between the UK and North America. After a showdown at Sandringham it was made clear, Harry would not be able to pick and choose his royal duties and would have to choose all or nothing.

Anyone who hopes to call Buckingham Palace, Sandringham or Windsor Castle their office faces a tough job interview process so the royal family family can ensure their staff are discreet and excellent at what they do. When it comes to hiring a new cleaner, the recruitment team have a strange test to spot the special cleaners amid the good ones. According to Tracey Waterman, the head of recruitment, the team put the secret challenge to all interviewees to see how they react. She explains that she will place a dead fly on the fireplace or carpet of the room to seethey notice it - and what they dothey spot it. Speaking during Channel aposs documentary Sandringham: The Royals at Christmas, she said: The dference between housekeeper in a five-star hotel and in a royal Palace would be attention to detail. One of the tests I like to do, to seea candidate has potential eye for detail, is to place a dead fly, either in the fireplace or on the carpet. Once the dead fly is placed, I then bring the candidate into the room. I lead them into the room quite slowly, just giving them a chance to glance at the room, have a little look at what we’ve got inside the room.  Bringing them to the fireplace, maybe highlighting that we’ve got a beautul fireplace. At this point I’d expect them to see the dead fly, and hopefully pick it up.

But how much do you really know about it  New book Very British Weather - Over  Hidden Wonders from the World’s Greatest Forecasters, The Met Office - will make you a weather whizz in no time... Can it be too cold to snow  You sometimes hear people say that it is too cold to snow, but can that actually ever be the case  Strictly speaking, the answer is no, but it can be too dry to snow, and the colder air is, the drier it tends to be because cold air holds less water vapour than warmer air. At -°C, air’s capacity to hold moisture is only % that of air at freezing point. But even the coldest air observed near the Earth’s surface can hold some moisture. So, in theory it can’t be too cold to snow, but the colder the air is, the less likely it is that ice crystals will precipitate out and form into flakes to fall to Earth as snow. Shepherd’s delight Clouds are an invaluable source of information when it comes to forecasting the weather, and not just for trained meteorologists. People throughout history have used cloud formations in particular to predict the weather.One of the most famous examples from folklore is the saying ‘Red sky at night, shepherd’s delight. Red sky in the morning, shepherd’s warning’, which dates to biblical times. But is there any scientic basis to it  The saying is most reliable when weather systems predominantly come from the west, as they do in the UK.  A red sky appears when dust and small particles are trapped in the atmosphere by high pressure. This scatters blue light, leaving only red light to give the sky its notable appearance. Because high pressure moving in from the west is generally an indicator of good weather approaching, a red sky at night means that the next day will usually be dry and pleasant. A red sky in the morning tends to indicate that the high-pressure weather system has already moved east and the good weather has passed, most likely making way for a wet and windy low-pressure system later in the day.So, a red sky at night, or in the morning, can be helpful in working out what weather is to come, but it’s still worth checking the Met Office forecast before you head out without a brolly .The longest-lasting rainbow The longest-lasting rainbow in the UK was observed in Sheffield on  March  – it was visible for approximately  hours, from am to pm. This stood as the global record until it was surpassed by a rainbow in Taiwan that persisted for  hours and  minutes on  November .  Who Needs a Thermometer When You’ve Got a Cricket  Did you know that the sound of crickets chirping on a warm summer evening can tell you what temperature it is  The frequency of a cricket’s chirps is affected by air temperature, soyou count the number of chirps you hear over a period of  seconds then ide by  and add , you will arrive at an approximate temperature in Celsius. Britain’s biggest soaking The wettest day recorded in Britain was  December  when Honister Pass in Cumbria recorded . millimetres of rain in a single day, the result of Storm Desmond, which brought widespread heavy rain and storm-force winds to areas of Scotland and northern England. The same rainfall event also saw the highest accumulations ever recorded in Britain for a two-day period , recorded nearby in Thirlmere. The volume of rain that falls across Scotland in an average year is enough to fill Loch Ness, the largest lake by volume in the UK, more than  times over.  The volume of rain that falls across Northern Ireland in an average year is enough to fill Lough Neagh, the largest lake by area in the UK, around four and a half times. And the volume of rain that falls across England on an average day is enough to fill the Royal Albert Hall almost , times. Britain’s longest icicle Although the s of icicles are not officially recorded, one discovered on a bridge over the River Spey in Grantown, Inverness-shire, must have a good claim to being Britain’s longest ever. It was thought that water from a leaking pipe in the bridge was the source of the mammoth icicles, the longest of which grew to approximately . metres.  Raining Fish Despite the well-known saying, it has never actually rained cats and dogs in the UK, but it has, believe it or not, rained fish before. In , a shower of fish was recorded in Cranstead, Kent. And this was not a one-off event: in , fresh herring fell on fields on Islay in the Hebrides, and in February , dozens of fish fell in Mountain Ash, South Wales. The likely explanation is that waterspouts or tornadoes crossing bodies of water picked up the fish before depositing them again on the ground, much to the confusion of any onlookers.  Does lightning strike twice  Contrary to the popular saying, lightning does often strike more than once. The Empire State Building in New York is struck by lightning on average  times each year and was once struck eight times in  minutes. Closer to home, The Shard in London, the tallest building in Europe, was struck multiple times during a particularly ferocious storm on  May . How much does a cloud weigh  While there are many factors that will determine the exact amount of water a cloud can hold – including temperature, altitude and pressure – we can work with an estimate of about . grams of water per cubic metre in an average cumulus cloud. This means an average-sized cumulus would weigh about , kilograms, roughly the same as an Airbus A.  How extreme do we get in the UK  The highest temperature on record in the UK is .C, recorded in Cambridge in , and the lowest is -.C, recorded in Braemar in Scotland on  February  and  January , as well as at Altnaharra, also in Scotland, on  December . This is the equivalent of .C between the two extremes. Unusual rainbows . Moonbows form at night using light from the moon instead of the sun. The physics are the same as rainbows but, since the moon is less bright and since our eyes are less sensitive to colour at night, moonbows tend to be much less colourful.They are relatively rare, since they need a bright moon and also because showers are less common at night. . Monochrome rainbows occur at sunset or sunrise, the sunbeam has to travel through a larger slice of atmosphere at these times of day.The blue and green components of the sun’s white light are dispersed by the thicker atmosphere and the rainbow is instead dominated by reds and oranges. . Double rainbows occur when sunlight bounces around a raindrop not once but twice. The colours that make up the outer rainbow will be reversed compared to the colours of the inner rainbow.It’s even possible to see a triple rainbow, but each additional rainbow will appear fainter than the last.  . Fire rainbows form when sunlight is refracted through ice crystals in high cirrus clouds also known as upside-down rainbows, or circumhorizontal arcs – their technical name. They often appear high in the sky as quarter-circle rainbows, which is why they are sometimes referred to as ‘smiles in the sky’.How to build the best snowman So, wet snow is best for building a snowman, but surely all snow is made of water, so how can it be wetter or drier  One way to classy how wet snow is is not by how much water would be producedit melted but instead by how much free water it contains relative to the number of ice crystals – the less free water, the drier the snow: Water content in snow Dry: % water Moist: less than % water Wet:  to % water Very wet:  to % water Slush: more than % water Dry snow doesn’t stick together as well, and slush doesn’t hold its shape, so moist to wet snow is best for snowman building.  When it is colder, more water vapour freezes into ice crystals and produces drier snow, meaning that temperatures around or just above °C at ground level are ideal. When actually constructing your snowman, it is also helpful to pack the snow as tightly as possible, as this causes it to melt slightly and then refreeze into ice crystals, binding it together.

Former health worker Beryl Clark had her first dose of the Pfizer jab on December  at the Sale Le Centre and was booked to have her second on January . But the second appointment has been cancelled and postponed - and she is yet to be given a new date, the Manchester Evening News reports. Ms Clark says this is despite medics drumming into her how important it was to get it within three weeks. She says she feels worried and had the first dose under  impressions. And she is one of a huge amount left confused at the change. One social media user tweeted: Just found out that my mum got the vaccine and had her appointment for  days after for the second, as has been tested, but the government has cancelled those appointments and is making her get it  weeks after her initial one, which could be completely ineffective  Another said: My parents would love their second shot of the Pfizer vaccine but government decided their pre-arranged appointment should be cancelled. Has your vaccine appointment been cancelled  Let us know in the comments below One said: Had my appointment for the nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine cancelled today.

At five minutes per phone call, thataposs  hours work. Not to mention the grief and anger. The four UK Chief Medical Officers have determined that prioritising the first doses of vaccine for as many people as possible on the priority list will protect the greatest number of at risk people overall in the shortest possible time and will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality, severe disease and hospitalisations and in protecting the NHS and equivalent health services. Second doses of either vaccine will now take place within  weeks rather than the  days that was initially planned with the Pfizer BioNTech jab, following a change in guidance which aims to accelerate immunisation. Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said administering the second dose of the vaccine  weeks after the first instead of the original three will save lives. Ms Clark received a text on Monday morning telling her the appointment on the th would no longer be going ahead. The text read: “Following updated NHS guidance to prioritise the first dose of the vaccine, your second dose on January  has been postponed. “You will contacted to rebook your second appoint in due course. Please avoid calling about this as we don’t have availability for the second vaccine. “Your first dose still offers considerable protection.” Beryl hasn’t been given a new date for her second dose.  She said: “I’m not very happy. When I went for my first dose they were drumming it into you how important it was to come back for your second dose within three weeks. “I gave permission for my first dose on the understanding that I would receive my second dose in three weeks. “I had that first dose under  impressions, they’ve broken that contract. Now, they’ve given me no date, nothing at all. “You’ve got the government telling you it’s okay, but when you’re watching the TV and reading the paper, and Pfizer themselves say it needs to be done in three weeks. “I’m stuck there wondering what is happening and nobody knows.” Beryl used to work for Manchester council and Salford town hall’s health team, originally supporting the work of mobile health clinics during the role out of the polio vaccine. She said she is concerned about the potential effect of increasing the time between doses. Beryl added: “In all probability it will be fine, or it could lose all its power and result in a lot of people with just one injection. “Will it continue to give you protection ”  Beryl said those who had second doses booked in should have their appointments honoured. She said: “For those who agreed to having them three weeks apart, they should given that second injection. “For those who weren’t booked in, make sure they have the facts in front of them and they can make that decision for themselves. “It makes you worried. I’m not one for panicking, but I am concerned. I do feel rather let down. “I blew up when I saw [the text], I was so angry. I know how important it is to get vaccinations out there. “We older people stay calm about things, but it doesn’t do you any good when you’re sat here isolated, worrying about it. I think there will be a lot of people worried and concerned with nobody medical to talk to about it and reassure people. It just hangs over you, it’s not right.”  Beryl’s daughter Yvette said: “It’s knocked her confidence and taken that glimpse of hope away from her. She was feel a bit invincible, then all of a sudden that’s changed. No, she’s frightened.” In a letter to all NHS trusts in England, the NHS’s chief executive, CCO and medical director said: “The aim, of course, is to vaccinate at-risk groups as fast as supply makes possible. The four UK Chief Medical Officers have determined that ‘prioritising the first doses of vaccine for as many people as possible on the priority list will protect the greatest number of at risk people overall in the shortest possible time and will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality, severe disease and hospitalisations and in protecting the NHS and equivalent health services.’ “They recognise that this will mean we need to reschedule second doses for most of our current first dose recipients, but for the reasons set out today, doing so should substantially improve inidual and population-level protection against Covid- over the next three months.”  A spokesperson for the NHS said: “The MHRA, JCVI and UK Chief Medical Officers have updated the second dose timing guidance which the NHS has to follow, and which will increase the number of vulnerable people protected against COVID over the next three months, potentially saving thousands of lives.” It comes as red-faced Matt Hancock visited a GP surgery today to hail the Oxford vaccine rollout - but its delivery of jabs hadn’t arrived yet. Dr Ammara Hughes, a GP at the Bloombsury Surgery in London visited by Matt Hancock, told reporters: We were expecting our first AstraZeneca  today, but weaposve had a pushback for  hours so weaposre now getting that delivery tomorrow.

Yet almost four years on, the country is filled with more hate, death and destruction that has left it unrecognisable to the one I arrived in almost eight years ago. Amid of backdrop of Trump’s Tsunami of untruths, I’ve born witness to some of the most shameful events ever to take place in a supposed civilised society. They say journalism is the first rough draft of history, but only time will tell what will be taught in US high schools in  years time. Whether it will be America’s biggest ever mass shooting in Las Vegas, travelling to see a US leader toady up to murderous dictators, immigrant children being held in cages while separated from their parents, withdrawing from the fight against climate change or emboldening the rise of the deadly far-right, the list is endless. The writing was on the White House walls no sooner had Trump, and First Lady Melania moved in. Ever since, amid made-up crowd sizes, an obsession with Barack Obama, and “alternative facts,” the Trump presidency has been a factory of hoods from the get-go. It has churned out distortions, deceptions, conspiracy theories and brazen lies at a production-line pace that has fuelled an industry of fact-checkers. The firing of former FBI director James Comey was more signicant than most could have thought. During a dinner with his new boss, he was asked by Trump whether he would pledge loyalty to him.  Comey avoided making such a promise explaining his role was to serve the American people. Months later, he was fired without being told. Above all, it illustrated Trump’s disregard for the rule of law that has since seen him turn the US Department of Justice into his own legal firm. To then see Trump in July  side with Vladimir Putin against the FBI contradicting his own US intelligence agencies who said there had been Russian interference in the  election, was jaw-dropping. If allies like the UK had not been put on notice before the Helsinki summit over where the US leader’s feelings lay at that point they did. He single handily shattered America’s global image. Only the month before I had travelled to Singapore to see Trump meet with North Korean despot Kim Jong Un on the hope of striking a deal to de-escalate the rogue nation’s proleration of nuclear weapons. What followed was an abject failure on the Trump administration’s part, yet the President still crowed about how he “fell in love” with the murderous dictator. If the problems were not bad enough on a world stage, domestically they were worse. Shortly his inauguration, the simmering rise of the white nationalism emboldened under his leadership boiled over.  During a ‘Unite the Right Rally’ in August  members of the alt-right, neo-Confederates, neo-fascists, white nationalists, neo-Nazis, the KKK and ious right-wing militias marched on Charlottesville, Virginia. The event quickly turned violent when Hitler-loving James Field ran over  counter-protestors killing Heather Heyer. As the country became a tinder box of racial ide, Trump initially refused to comment, but I watched in New York as he then said there were “very fine people on both sides”. It was the first of many instances of his apparent support for the far-right that, along with the radical left, has seen many of America’s cities more recently go up in flames. The fact that now no one blinks an eye when the leader of the free is called a “racist”, should be of enormous concern to us all.  It was never more apparent in the wake of George Floyd’s death in May this year - killed after white cop Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes. As I stood watching the city of Minneapolis looted and torched, it was a time for the President to show leadership - to bring together a country that was clearly hurt and in turmoil. Instead, Trump added fuel to the already burning fire pitting Black Lives Matter protestors against police and more shamefully white nationalist groups. Yet despite high-profile incidents of police violence against Black Americans in recent months, including the killing of Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake sparking nationwide protests, renewed calls for the removal of Confederate symbols and public condemnations of systemic racism from lawmakers, corporations, sports leagues and others, recent research shows adult white America feels largely unmoved.  Americans are sceptical the current moment of racial reckoning will lead to major changes in the States, according to a new Pew Research Centre survey. They found: “The public is about evenly split on whether the increased focus on issues of race and racial inequality in the country in the past three months will lead to major policy changes to address racial inequality - % say it will and % say it will not. “A sizable sharesay this will not lead to changes that will improve the lives of Black people. And while a majority say the heightened attention to racial issues represents a change in the way most Americans think about these issues, just % say this represents a major change.” They found overall, % of U.S. adults now say the country hasn’t gone far enough when it comes to Black people having equal rights with White people but “White Americans are virtually unchanged”.  But it’s not just races that Trump, who became only the third president ever to be impeached, ides, its gender too. We should have all known. While campaigning for the White House, he was heard on tape saying of women it was perfectly acceptable to “Grab ‘em by the p****. You can do anything.” Yet still, America’s females voted for him in their millions. He has repeatedly, even during this campaign, belittled women none more so than the two dozen who have accused him of sexual impropriety and even rape. In response to writer E. Jean Carroll’s claim, he sexually assaulted her in a dressing room at a Manhattan department store in the mid-s he simply replied: “She’s not my type”.  Yet despite the accusations, the evangelicals of America still embrace him as he claims to be a good Christian - “a man of God” - using the Bible as a prop for any photo opportunity. Even after his alleged  marital affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels came to light paying her off to keep her silent, that was ok with the church because he was now a “changed person”. If it were left to Trump, the Bible would no doubt read: “Let he who has bedded a porn star just after the birth of his fth child with his third we cast the first stone.” He also pushed for transgender servicemen and women - who unlike his dodge of the Vietnam draft were prepared to put their lives on the line for American freedoms, to be banned from the military. It’s challenging to know which of Trump’s policies have been for the greater good. There is no doubt he had continued to build on the economy inherited from Barack Obama and almost wiped ISIS from the earth. Still, his recent handling of the pandemic will go down as one of the worst disasters in US history.

Members of his cabinet have begun talks to invoke the th Amendment on the basis he is unfit to serve out his final two weeks - a position that Democrats and many Americans have held throughout his presidency while Republicans protected him and allowed him to remain in power. Ratied after the assassination of John F Kennedy in , the amendment has never been used to strip a sitting presidentaposs powers, but it would be the fastest way to seize control from Trump. Click here for our live blog with the latest updates on the chaos in Washington. Trump, , incited his supporters as they rallied in Washington while lawmakers met to confirm Democratic President-elect Joe Bidenaposs election victory. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be sworn in on January . Trump was blamed when a mob of his deluded fanatics - condemned as terrorists - stormed the the Capitol bulding in Washington in a bid to overturn his election defeat. He was condemned as he sat back and watched it happen, failed to condemn the violence and swtly call for peace, and later told those involved in the insurrection: We love you. Youaposre very special. Four people died during the chaos, including a Trump fanatic who was shot.  It caps four years of Trump iding America by encouraging chaos and violence, courting white supremacists and far-right groups, and spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories. He may have cemented himself this week as the worst US president ever. What is the th Amendment  The th Amendment of the US Constitution - specically, Section  of the amendment - allows a transfer of presidential powers to the vice president, but it does not remove a president from office. This isnapost the first time it has come up during Trumpaposs reign of terror. It would happenthe vice president and a majority of the cabinet determined the president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties” of the office. If a president opposes, Congress can order the transfer of power with a two-thirds vote in both chambers - the Senate and the House of Representatives. The vice president, currently Mike Pence, would then become acting president.Is it going to happen before January   A source told Reuters there have been discussions among some cabinet members and Trump allies about invoking the th Amendment. But a second source familiar with the effort doubted it would go anywhere with Trump having just two more weeks in office. A growing number of Republican leaders and cabinet officials told CNN they believe Trump should be removed from office before January . CNN said four of them called for the th Amendment to be invoked, and two others said the president should be impeached. Some cabinet members are holding preliminary discussions about invoking the th Amendment, a Republican source told CNN.  It remains unclear whether the movement will gather enough support. Why does it exist  The amendment was introduced by federal lawmakers and approved by US states after President John F Kennedy was shot dead in . Before JFK was confirmed dead, there was a debate over who would run the countryhe survived but was unable to carry out his duties. The amendment was ratied in . Has it been used before  The th Amendment has never been used to remove a president from office. It was used to fill two vice-presidential vacancies in the s.Is there another option  In the wake of Wednesdayaposs violence, there have been calls for a second impeachment of Trump. The only way to remove a president from office is an impeachment in the House and a conviction in the Senate. If Trump is impeached and removed, the Senate could vote to disqualy him from ever holding federal office again. An elected Republican official told CNN: He has to be impeached and removed. A former senior official added: How do you keep him in place for two weeks after this Trump was previously impeached but survived a trial in February last year when the Senate acquitted him of obstructing Congress and abusing the power of his office. He was accused of freezing Congress-approved aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, and impeding the inquiry by blocking witnesses and documents sought by the House of Representatives. Trump would have been removed from office and replaced by Pence had he been convicted of either charge. What happened in Washington  Lawmakers from the House of Representatives, the lower chamber, and Senate, the upper chamber, were meeting at the Capitol to confirm Bidenaposs clear victory over Trump in the November  presidential election. The certication of the final Electoral College vote -  votes for Biden and  for Trump - was the final step before Biden and Harris are sworn in on January . Trump, who has ly claimed that the election was rigged, encouraged his fanatics, including white supremacists and far-right extremists, to march on the Capitol after inciting them for months.  Speaking to thousands of his supporters near the White House shortly before the chaos unfolded, he told them to pressure their elected officials to reject the results and urged them to fight. As lawmakers held a debate before the certication of the fair election result, hundreds of deluded Trump supporters - condemned as terrorists - stormed Americaaposs seat of power in a bid to overturn his election defeat. Police and security have been heavily criticised for failing to stop the insurrection. Four people died.  A Trump fanatic was shot dead and three other people suffered fatal medical emergencies as the mob clashed with police, invaded the floor of the Senate and offices belonging to the likes of House Speaker and Democrat Nancy Pelosi, and raided rooms. This happened as Trump refused to condemn the insurrection and attempt to de-escalate the violence. Later, in a recorded video, he told the protesters We love you, youaposre very special and repeated his lies about the election result, overshadowing his weak request for them to go home. At least  people were arrested. It was the most damaging attack on the iconic building since the British army burned it in , according to the US Capitol Historical Society.

Sheaposs worn it for work, while out walking, to chill out on the sofa and even on Christmas Day. In fact, the -year-old has worn the Rowena dress, which is made from sustainably sourced merino wool, for  days in a row. The church Leader and college chaplain Sarah Robbins-Cole joked that sheaposs taking her job very literally, becoming a lady of the cloth. Sarah, who  lives in Boston, USA, joined the  Day Dress Challenge on September ,  in a bid to live without fast fashion and help save the planet. She enjoyed it so much that sheaposs set herself a new challenge for . “To my surprise, wearing the same dress for  days in a row didn’t take anything away from my le. “Instead, it’s inspired me to go one step further and not to buy any new clothes or accessories between January , , and January , . “I realised that, at my age, I have clothes for every occasion andI need a ballgown, I’ll dust one off that’s been in my wardrobe since !“I am thinking of clearing my wardrobe and having a big declutter, but I’ll wait and see what I do wear over this coming year first.”Sarah has three children with her British husband, clergyman Adrian - Elizabeth and Will - and the family have two rescue dogs. She was among about  women who took up the -day challenge, run by clothing brand Wool.  Designed to show participants how wearing just one garment every day would change their spending habits, reduce their laundry load and, by not buying fast fashion, help them to save the planet, it also changed the way Sarah felt about how she looks and dresses. “I first saw the challenge on social media and thought why not ” said Sarah. “So, I really was a lady of the cloth!” Participants were allowed to wash and dry the dress overnight, butthey were awake, they were expected to wear it. And anyone who completed the challenge would win a , which is £, voucher to spend on a new Wool dress.  Teaming her long-sleeved, scoop-neck, knee- Rowena dress, made from sustainably sourced merino wool, with a dog collar when she was working and even tucking it into jeans for an outdoor hike, she then documented the challenge by posting all her  dferent looks on her Instagram page @thisdressagain.Sarah, who has just started a sabbatical and is in the midst of a doctoral programme in educational leadership, says not only did her repetitive wardrobe simply her le, it also taught her about something she calls “spotlighting.” “Spotlighting is that feeling that everyone is looking at you when in reality, they’re probably not,” she said. “Wearing the same dress for so long helped me avoid that feeling.”  The only really dficult part of the whole challenge, according to Sarah, was having to post a new look every day on social media. She said: “I forewarned my college students that I would be taking the challenge because they’d be seeing me in the same dress every day, which they might find odd. “But, more importantly, I told them not to think when they looked at the pictures I posted that they were a true reflection of my le and that I was always that tidy and well put together. “It was important to me for them to know that. “I remember one student telling me how she could come out of a lecture feeling happy, check her phone, see what looked like someone ’s picture-perfect le and feel depressed by the time she had crossed the campus to her next lecture.  “By taking on this challenge, I had an insight into the unbelievable pressure that comes with social media.” She was equally surprised by the number of random followers she attracted – including some very handsome men – who found their way to her Instagram pages – who she feared were not who they said they were. She also received some intimate and inappropriate comments from strangers, who she ended up blocking. But, overall, she had a very insightful and worthwhile experience, saying: “The dress was comfortable, easy to wear and completely unremarkable.  “I enjoyed accessorising it and, although I missed wearing jeans and found the long sleeves a bit warm when the sun came out, I didn’t really miss anything from my normal wardrobe. “It was so easy to get up and get dressed in the same thing. It saved me loads of time and it was simple to brighten it up using accessories. “The challenge did make me think about how many clothes end up in landfill, how much water is used to produce cotton and how we don’t really know whether the clothes we buy are made ethically, too.” Most importantly, the challenge helped Sarah to connect on a deeper level with what really matters in le.

Christine Dacera, from General Santos City in the Philippines, was found dead in a bathtub and rushed to the hospital on January  morning. Prior to her death, Christine checked in at the luxury City Garden Hotel in the city of Makati with three male friends for a New Year’s party, where more men joined them. She is seen in one of the images holding a glass of wine as several men follow her to the room. Christine had been partying with at least  men, most of which were identied by police as gay men, starting December  evening until she was found unconscious in the morning. Makati police chief Colonel Harold Depositar said the -year-old had injuries on her arms and legs with traces of sperm on her genitalia, which police claim was rape and homicide. He said: The victim had lacerations and sperm in her genitalia.  Only three of them were Dacera’s friends. The others were practically strangers to her, as they were only known to her three friends. The initial autopsy report of the cause of death was a ruptured aortic aneurysm, which could be due to very strenuous activity and probably a high level of alcohol toxicity.  However, Christine’s family as well as the Commission on Human Rights will be conducting independent autopsy examination. People yesterday said Christine may have been gang raped during the all-night party. Ms Dacera was with several colleagues and one of them, the men, woke up at around am and noticed her asleep in the bathtub, he said.  He covered her with a blanket before going back to sleep. When the man woke up several hours later, he found her still unconscious and a blue colour. The Philippine Airlines attendant was given CPR after the man raised to alarm, but she did not wake up.  Ms Dacera was rushed to the Makati Medical Clinic where doctors confirmed her death. Sharon Dacera, the victimaposs mother, told  Oras that she believed her daughter would be safe at the party. “I didn’t have any presumptions that something will happen to my daughter because she was with other flight attendants,” Sharon said.“Why did they have to do that to my child  I want to seek justice. Investigators confirmed that the young womanaposs body was bruised and cut prior to the autopsy. Around  people attended a private party in the room the group had rented.

Conservationists dashed to her rescue on New Year’s Eve placing the Indian elephant in a specially designed ambulance for the , mile journey from the city of Dhanbad in the east of the country to Mathura in the north. Emma was found severely malnourished and suffering from painful and chronic osteoarthritis and degenerative joints disease. Sharp glass, metal and stone fragments were also embedded in her footpads. Wildle SoS, who staged the rescue, said her abusers had given her little respite as they regularly used Emma for “begging, religious processions, wedding ceremonies, tourist rides and any activity that her owner found to be lucrative.” The Indian charity said: “At night, she was tightly restrained, preventing her from lying down and resting. She was fed an unhealthy diet of sweets and fried foods that left her immunity and health severely compromised. “She was also regularly force-fed crude country liquor to force her to work despite the pain in her legs.“When questioned her owners said they couldn’t afford proper medical treatment. Shockingly, it is not uncommon for captive elephants to be given alcohol and tobacco by their owners as home remedies to combat health problems. “In reality, elephants cannot metabolise alcohol and it is toxic for the animal. Such callousness can also cause inebriation, which could result in the elephant running rampant across a crowded area, endangering the lives of innocent bystanders.”An examination by Wildle SOS’ vet said the elephant is lting her forelimbs abnormally frequently to compensate for the severe pain in her legs caused by years of abuse resulting in degenerative joints disease of the forelimbs.

opened a public consultation on its proposals, seeking feedback from locals ahead of it filing any formal planning applications.Details will be formally lodged with Aberdeen City Council in the coming months.According to the plans, the ,sq ft supermarket will have  parking spaces and #improve the range and quality of shopping available# to those in Altens, Kincorth, Cove and Torry.It is proposed for the site of oil firm Amec Foster Wheeler#s former offices, which are currently being demolished after lying empty since .A statement from Aldi said: #The proposals would see a new, modern food store development to serve residents living within the south of Aberdeen, including the communities of Altens,#The development will also help regenerate a high-profile site that has lain vacant for a number of years, delivering both investment and jobs to the local area.#The supermarket chain is preparing to open a new store in nearby Portlethen this year.And in September, planning permission was granted for an Aldi supermarket in Countesswells.Scottish Conservative north-east MSP Liam Kerr said: “It’s extremely positive to see plans for a new Aldi supermarket in Altens during such a dficult period caused by the coronavirus pandemic.“Job creation is absolutely vital and these proposals will provide a welcome boost to residents living in areas such as Altens, Cove, Kincorth and Torry.“It’s

develop and it’s great to see businesses wanting to invest in the area.”Kincorth, Nigg and Cove councillor Alex Nicoll said: #As local residents are aware the area continues to be built out and the provision of additional services is necessary.#I am sure the local community will welcome the provision of an additional choice of supermarket to serve the area.#The plans can be viewed in detail at:

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print please be aware that track and path closures can happen at any time. All walks are undertaken at your own risk. Please continue to adhere to current guidelines as set out by the government, exercise responsibly and use appropriate clothing and equipment for your chosen outdoor activity. Inform a contact about your route whereabouts. Don’t forget your phone, snacks, drink, any medication first aid supplies you may need and to check weather conditions. Most walks are dog friendly but please keep your dog under close control, especially around livestock and wildle.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

These additional consumers will need more food while Scotland’s multial land can also meet, at the same time, the growing demand for a range of goods and services that hits targets on climate change, the environment, renewable energy, bioersity, and the wider and hugely important rural economy.#To move forward urgently, let us identy all the means and mechanisms we can put in place.  Let us have credibility for farmers by investing in bioeconomy, bioenergy, agro-forestry, precision farming, and shorter food chains – support for which is within the Government’s gt.#NFUS has been promoting our industry as one that can change to meet public goods for public money requirements, with an upbeat forward-looking mindset. This outlook will empower our farmers and crofters and drive us forward to the holy grail of sustainable profit with all the environmental, welfare and standards the public expect as thefor their investment and support for our industry.#In , the black cloud of COVID- needs swept away, a process driven by the vaccines that our scientists have developed, and lessons learned on the things we should do better but also how we have adapted and adopted new methods for good.#People should be more accepting of others’ views with ambition to work collaboratively for mutual benefit. There is a belief binary tribalism is ‘the norm’ and the use of social media to promulgate the “yer either for us or agin us” culture is acceptable. It is not hard being considerate and kind.#Agriculture also urgently needs delivery of an ambitious coherent policy delivering a sustainable profitable industry that addresses climate change, bioersity and an increasing demand for nutritious high standard and welfare food. Procrastination has a price.#Brexit will go by, like foot and mouth, the oil crisis, and the great depression, but we need enough freedom and flexibility to be able to innovate and chose our own paths through it as well.#We need to throw open our doors to the public and build trust on what we do and how we do it. There is huge potential from selling our story both on farm and in the food chain.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes amiss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!First footingA tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.TelevisionAs always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. Therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.Live eventsThe events that Scotlandrsquos festive season is famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year. However, many are embracing a digital approach for the first time, making it easier for us to enjoy the festivities from our homes.Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay, which usually takes the form of an incredible street party with live performances and festivities, will instead be heading online. It will bring to le an exciting new piece of writing by award-winning poet and Scots Makar, Jackie Kay, creating Scotlandrsquos first-ever large-scale drone show and the largest drone show ever seen in the UK.Around  drones will create iconic images and words in the Scottish sky set to original words and music by Jackie Kay and Skyersquos Niteworks.

Clearly, we will stay closely involved and be seeking the best possible outcome as we have done in the past.’TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOSpy camera scheme takes a step forwardThe group planning to set up a town centre security system in Campbeltown is considering applying to the government for funding.The Scottish Office has just made £ million available to pay for , new closed circuit television cameras to help fight crime in Scottish towns.The driving force behind Campbeltown’s proposed system, Kintyre Crime Prevention Panel, recently received an estimate for the cost of installing a system from a leading security firm. Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

A year that saw so many things we took for granted taken from us – our normal family events, our employment and our interaction with our friends.In true Kintyre style, we found ways of minimising the effects of these disruptions by using technology, supporting the vulnerable and keeping in touch by telephone. But it was a scary time for all of us.When this #Thought for the Week# was in the planning stage, we imagined that in our corner of Scotland, in Kintyre, we would be well rid of strict lockdowns, have a low position on the tier system and le would be getting back to some sort of normality. We are not there yet.When parents are bringing up children, they teach them by repetition – clean your teeth tidy your bedroom I love you, you are special.God, as our Father, does exactly the same. In the Bible, more than  times He says: #Do not be afraid# or phrases that mean this. Let us take this truth into the New Year with us.Let us all pray that soon we can say we are not afraid and what a dferent year  is.#Away, then all fears.

There was heavy traffic and, needless to say, Irsquod never driven a bus before and hadnrsquot expected to at this moment either.ldquoYou mean drive the bus  I foolishly asked.ldquoThatrsquos why you are here, isnrsquot it  he replied.I was on the bus with two other learners, as well as the instructor. We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping. I love it, but when I get home I appreciate my bed, my shower and central heating in ways I didnrsquot before we left on our camping trip!The virus has forced a reset on all of us it has taken away many things we took for granted: travel, staying with friends, family meals, a coffee and blether with a friend, hugging loved ones, being with loved ones, browsing in a bookshop. We will all have our list.It has been heartbreaking, with devastating consequences for so many peoplersquos livelihoods and emotional wellbeing, as well as a tragic loss of le.Itrsquos an unwanted, brutal and forced reset, but the le lesson I learnt on the tours has helped me understand that appreciation is the key to resilience and getting through this as best as we can.When times relax, as they hopefully will soon, I know how much I will appreciate hugging my daughter I havenrsquot been able to hug for  months, being able to tell stories to a live audience and have a coffee with a friend in a real cafe. And travel to the places I love within my own country.Perhapsthere is any positive out of this, I hope it will be that I will never again fall into that treadmill of taking things I have for granted.So I say Happy New Year to you, and I mean it in a heartfelt way I never meant before."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-consider-welcoming-new-pet","story":"ONCE your new puppy or kitten has settled into your household, there are several things to consider, ensuring your new pet is kept fit and healthy.Register with your veterinary surgeon. This gives immediate reassurancea problem does arise with your pet.At Dunedin Vets, we offer free puppy and kitten checks and for all new pets as soon as you acquire them this may be carried out by telephone during these Covid- times. Lots of advice is given by vets, qualied veterinary nurses and reception staff.Everyone is thinking about vaccination against coronavirus for humans just now. Vaccination has been the major controller of lethal diseases since the process was developed by Edward Jenner centuries ago.We must vaccinate our pets to prevent several fatal conditions. Pups can be vaccinated from six weeks of age. However, vaccinating at  and  weeks of age is the new normal during this Covid- pandemic, when most vaccinations are given.Pups should be kept isolated until two weeks after the first vaccination, then limited contact with other dogs until after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against parvovirus, distemper, hepatitis leptospirosis and kennel cough.It is advisable to vaccinate your kitten against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia. Two vaccines are usually given three weeks apart from nine weeks of age. Kittens should be kept isolated until one week after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia.Rabbits can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease , of which there are two strains. One vaccine against the two agents can be given from six weeks of age. Boosters are given annually.Everyone loves a new puppy or kitten, but please be aware of unscrupulous dealers who take advantage of the kind and loving nature of the majority of people.Recently, Kimberly Mackie visited Dunedin Vetsrsquo Tranent surgery with her new puppy Poppy. Poppy is a Jack Russell cross Chihuahua, so is a very small pup. However, Poppy arrived with diarrhoea and very dehydrated, weighing only a few hundred grams.Poppy was examined by vet Chris Monk, who immediately saw how ill little Poppy was.Mum had bought her in all good faith from a family home. It was soon discovered that Poppy had been microchipped and had a vaccination in Eire. Poppy was an import from Eire, a victim of the illegal puppy farming trade.It is so dficult for new owners to know the origin of their pup, especially when the sellers can seem so plausible. Ask to see the parents or at least the mother and other pups in the litter, although they find many ways to circumvent these questions. It is also so dficult toa puppy or kitten once you have cuddled them and instantly fallen in love.The good news is that Poppy, after fluid therapy and medications, and lots of loving care from Dunedin Vets staff and, of course, his forever mum, has made a full recovery and is developing her own special character.We must also consider other preventable conditions which our pets may be susceptible to.Most puppies and kittens are born with a roundworm infestation. Worms are passed to them before birth by their mothers and through motherrsquos milk. This is obviously not very pleasant and potentially these worms pose a risk for humans, especially children.Tapeworms are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens, although one type is actually transmitted by fleas.We recommend worming puppies and kittens at eight,  and  weeks of age with a quality wormer in tablet or liquid form, which will kill most worms.Remember, there may be no obvious signs of worm infestation.Worming should be carried out every three months for the rest of your petrsquos le.Many puppies and kittens arrive at their new home with a population of external parasites. These include fleas and mites.Fleas are passed from one animal to another. Although there are dferent types of dog and cat fleas, they donrsquot mind what they jump onto to feed!Fleas are two to three millimetres long and move quickly through the coat. Flea droppings are black and gritty, and turn reddamp cotton wool is applied to them.Fleas can transmit several diseases, cause allergies and general irritation. Fleas live on your pet, and in the house.You must use a suitable insecticide spray to destroy flea larvae, which can survive for months in the environment. Your veterinary staff can advise what is best for your pet and your home.The rabbit flea is unusual in that it doesnrsquot move very fast. They are often found along the edge of catsrsquo ears and are dficult to remove, so are called lsquostick tightrsquo fleas. Cats pick them up when hunting wild rabbits.Walking dandruff mitesare very common in puppies, kittens and bunnies. They are too small to see but occasionally skin scurf appears to move, which is actually the mites, hence the name.Mange mitesare minute parasites which bury into the skin. Some are passed from mother to young and some spread from pet to pet. Some cause intense scratching, some cause hair loss. Some can be very dficult to treat, requiring specialised anti-parasitic washes or spot on treatment.Ear mites live in the ear canals, causing irritation, lots of wax production and a smell.At Dunedin Vets, we strongly recommend taking out insurance for your pet at a young age. Many breeders will provide initial insurance cover, and many vets will offer free insurance with certain companies for a few weeks. This gives peace of mind whilst you are considering which insurance to purchase. We suggest you look for a lsquolelong coverrsquo policy so your pet will always be covered.Consider a pet health club for your new arrival. Many veterinary practices, including Dunedin Vets, offer this type of scheme. Basically, you spread the cost of your petrsquos preventative healthcare over the year rather than being faced with large bills at booster time, so allowing you to budget monthly for this.Dunedin Vetsrsquo pet health club offers many other benefits and discounts. During these dficult times, many people are finding this a great way to ensure the best care for their pets without burdening themselves financially.Puppies, kittens and bunnies bring so much love to a family and help so much in your wellbeing ndash choose wisely, and look after them well, and you will have a friend and companion for le."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-29-31-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoPLEASE drink up... the pub is on firersquo was a headline in the East Lothian Courier on December , .Time was called early at the Auld Hoose pub in North Berwick last Wednesday after a fire broke out in the public bar.Customers spotted smoke coming from the floor near a fireplace about pm and the local fire brigade was alerted.The premises were evacuated ndash including an upstairs flat occupied by Jean Borthwick and her Labrador dog, Freeway ndash as landlord Ian McMinn tried to tackle the blaze with a fire extinguisher containing powder.But help was soon at hand in the shape of his brother Hugh, a local fireman, and the rest of the retained crew who began fighting the dense smoke and flames.Sub-officer McMinn explained that cracks in the old hearth at the pubrsquos real fire had caused joists and beams on the floor to burn.AN EAST Lothian pupil became the first from his high school to be accepted to study at the University of Cambridge, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .Ian Graham, son of Sergeant and Mrs Graham, Tranent, has been accepted for entry into Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in October .Ian is at present in his sixth year at the Ross High School.He was Dux of the School in his fth year and is at present Head Boy.He is a young man of high intellectual ability but at the same time he is an accomplished games player, playing in the School XV and also in the Badminton Club.He is an office-bearer in the Literary and Debating Society and last summer was a gold medallist in athletics at the Scottish Schools Athletics Championships.A MAN was fined pound after being caught stealing a bird from a train station, as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .In the Burgh Court, on Friday, before Bailie Main, James Kelly, railway porter, Church Street, Haddington, pleaded guilty to having, on Tuesday, st, stolen a cockerel from a hamper lying in the booking-hall of the station.The Fiscal stated that, about eight orsquoclock on the night in question, a booking-clerk heard a person entering the booking-hall on tip-toe.On going out, he found Kelly alongside the hamper.He made the excuse that the label had been torn off the hamper, and that he was putting it on.The label was afterwards found lying on the floor, but it was discovered that the hamper had been opened and the cockerel removed."},{"url":null,"title":"7am-wait-worth-mum-bonnie-babies-champion-2020-harris-tait","story":"Harris Tait, who celebrated his first birthday on December , was announced as the winner in last weekrsquos Courier.He lives on East Lintonrsquos Longstone Avenue with mum Kirsty, , and dad Andrew, , a maintenance team leader at Torness Power Station.Kirsty described Harris as a ldquofunny and cheeky little boy with ldquosuch a little personality.She added: ldquoHe knows what he wants and is a determined little guy, which I think he takes from me and Andrew.Kirsty, who has been on maternity leave this year but is ing to work on Monday as a customer trade manager at Asda in Livingston, said Harrisrsquo win had been a boost to the family after what has been a tumultuous year.She said: ldquoItrsquos not really been the greatest year and hersquos not been able to interact with other kids and I thought, lsquoWhat have we got to lose rsquo so decided to enter him.ldquoYou never think that you are going to win competitions like these.When the results were announced in last weekrsquos Courier, Kirsty said she was ldquobuzzing and ldquoa bit emotional.

I will set out our decisions shortly.However, I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from midnight tonight for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":null,"title":"new-lockdown-rules-scotland-covid-restrictions-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules on Monday afternoon, asthe latest restrictions came into effect from midnight today in all Level  areas of the country andwill continue throughout the month.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes.

From fruit and vegetables to herb gardens, the discovery that you dont need a huge space and that lots can be grown in a container, means this will continue to trend.\"Jungle vibes\"Jungle style gardens are on the rise, with our love of big leaves and lush foliage showing no signs of slowing down,\" says Eyles. \"Going tropical, think banana plants, cannas and citrus, and dense planting with pops of bright colour. Whether it is a few statement plants, or a garden filled with exotic greenery, you will be transported to an outdoor oasis.\"Ornamental grasses\"Other planting styles we predict to be even bigger in  are those that help create a sanctuary of calm, with foliage plants in pots, such as ferns, grasses and bamboo,\" Eyles says.Big ideas for small plotsDuff says: \"Its an exciting time because the aesthetic of the garden is changing.

A raised bed can be an ideal solution for this.\"Get them involved from the beginning by adding personalised signs and finding out what they would like to grow.

It was also commended for including a system that brakes the car following a crash. The only real negative was that it could cause higher damage to other vehicles in a crash.Seat LeonThe Leon shares a  with the A and therefore scores similarly. However, it did marginally better in adult occupant protection, despite near-identical comments on injury protection. It also received a small penalty for the damage it could cause other vehicles, but otherwise received good marks for protecting passengers from injury.Volkswagen ID.Volkswagens new electric vehicle also underwent testing this year, getting full marks. It performed well in preventing injuries to its passengers, but was also noted for not causing excessive damage to the crash barrier, indicating its also quite friendly to other vehicles in a crash. The main negative was the fact that the dummy moved too far across the vehicle in the side impact test.Toyota YarisThe Yaris might be small but it scored well across the board, receiving maximum points for protecting critical body parts in the side impact test. It also gained praise for having clear information on the front airbag system, which can be disabled for rear-facing child restraints. However, an unclear manual meant it failed on the installation check for some child restraints.Honda JazzAnother small car that performed well is the Jazz, which demonstrated a stable passenger compartment in the offset frontal test. Protection of the passengers was generally good, but was rated as weak for the drivers chest. It was noted that the centre airbag protected passengers colliding with each other in a side impact.Mazda MX-Another electric car, Mazdas new MX received top marks, doing particularly well in adult occupant protection, where it scored %. The report notes that protection of passengers was strong, scoring top marks in both the side barrier test and more severe side pole impact. It was knocked for not having an advanced emergency call system or post-collision braking.Land Rover DefenderLand Rover will be pleased to learn that one of the most highly anticipated new cars of the year scored top marks in testing, despite not being outstanding in any department. Euro NCAP noted that the femur protection score was penalised, as was chest protection of the rear passenger in the full-width rigid wall test. It was also considered an aggressive partner to other vehicles in the event of a crash.Kia SorentoAnother large SUV and another five stars, the Sorento was another that didnt stand out in any particular area but did well overall. Its central airbag, whiplash protection and driver assistance were all rated highly. However, its protection of the drivers chest and right femur was rated weak, with occupant protection rated marginal in this test because structures in the dashboard could cause a risk to occupants of dferent sizes.Isuzu D-MaxThe surprise of the year was the Isuzu D-Max pick-up, which scored top marks despite competing in a segment that is not famous for highlighting safety. It received similar occupant safety comments as the Sorento in the offset frontal test, and was also penalised for how it interacts with other vehicles in a crash. However, it typically scored highly for occupant protection in a iety of crash scenarios, as well as for having an emergency call system."},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-glasgow-pupils-connected-ever","story":"MANY aspects of our lives have changed because of the pandemic, but signicant effort has been put into keeping things as normal as possible for our young people.

However, this was a journey we were already on, and its effects will be felt for generations to come.Our focus should be on what technology allows our learners and teachers to do ndash and how education can be enriched through digital learning. Consider the young people with additional support needs, or those whose first language may not be English. Using an iPad, which was chosen specically for its accessibility features, we are able to engage with those young people on an even footing.The application of technology should be viewed in the context of delivering long-term socio-economic benefits which connect our young people to new opportunities, create a level playing field, and allow far greater flexibility both in and out of the classroom. Technology breeds creativity ndash and attainment is known to improvea young person feels more engaged and able to tailor their learning.We also recognised that the plan would not work based solely on new equipment but ensuring that our dedicated teachers and supportive parents and carers were on board. We created Digital Leader of Learning roles in each school, who are now working together across the city, sharing knowledge and experiences in a way like never before. We also created easy-to-use guides for parents so learning and teaching can continue just as easily at home as it can in the classroom.Our approach is being noticed across the world as an example of how we can support children and young people to become digital citizens and develop skills for the future.

My father was a typographer, and I was very interested in him, and by extension in his career. When I was  years old I studied typography myself, but already by that timethe profession was disappearing. So, I turned to graphic design, thinking in part that that was a profession where I could still sometimes absorb myself in the world of typography.In a year in which we have all been isolated, how have you found being alone  Is a pandemic good for cartooning The pandemic is too unsettling and destabilising for me to be able to make comics. I am ready for the winds of change to blow this unpleasant atmosphere away. I want to rediscover my choir, museums, theatre, art exhibits. After all, art nourishes art.What do you love about comic strips I love working alone. And I love the fact that, with pencil and paper alone, you can create and control a universe as complex as any found in feature- film.Whatrsquos your history with them My father bought me my first Tintin when I was six years old.

This is not the work of crusty French bread or a rogue brazil nut, but a soft-centred chocolate which, when bitten into, put up a fight. In size, this hand-made cherry brandy fondant, decorated in pink icing, was less a piece of confectionary and more a magicianrsquos top hat. Its neighbours were half its girth, whereas the lid bulged over this beauty. It was absolutely delicious but next time ndash and there will be a next time ndash Irsquoll use cutlery.Irsquove been eating a lot of chocolates lately. Turkey, stuffing, and panetone too, and a surfeit of other festive fare. In my defence, these caloric treats are balanced with seasonal side dishes of brussels sprouts, carrots and kale. Irsquove had a fondness for brussels sprouts since we had to boil a saucepan of them in my first domestic science class. It was the only lesson in this subject where I excelled. Back then, I seasoned with pepper.Today, a drizzle of olive oil turns them into the food of the gods. Thus, as I reach for a mid-morning biscuit, eyeing up the snow clouds outside and thinking of the energy required to get me through to lunch, I refuse to feel guilty. Others, however, seem hell-bent on pricking the nationrsquos conscience and turning an innocent cooked breakfast or buttered scone into a source of shame.There are many reasons to dread the start of the new year, not least the dark and cold. One unfailing, ill-timed and unnecessary scourge is the avalanche of advice doled out around January  by nutritionists and dieticians. Even worse than the tips of health professionals is the enthusiasm of former junk food addicts who, after a Damascene conversion that usually involves a near-death experience, are messianic about their new habits.My idea of weight control is whether or not I can tuck a T-shirt into my jeans after theyrsquove been in a -degree wash. The battery on my bathroom scales died years ago, since when theyrsquove been gathering dust under the bed. This is not something to boast about , but while I can face up to many things in le ndash a leaking roof, mice under the eaves, a looming taxdeadline ndash knowing how many kilos Irsquove gained is not one of them.There seems something sadistic about exhorting people to give up comfort food at precisely the time of year it was designed for. It might be fine to start January with a health kickyou live in Alice Springs or Calornia. In Achiltibuie or Crail, however, it feels cruel. When sleet is whistling around the windows, and the streets are coated in ice, the idea of following a meagre, challenging or carefully calibrated diet does not appeal.All of us know, by now, that Covid does not just love a crowd, it is also drawn to love handles. Being clinically obese is thought to raise the risk of coronavirus complications. The unfailing appearance of New Year diets, however, seems more a lestyle adjunct than a serious medical intervention. They fall into the same category as making resolutions to give up fags or booze, or to pound the pavement, clocking up steps like a hamster on a wheel. This year, however, therersquos not even the incentive of needing to be beach-ready by summer. I doubt many of us will be mentally prepared to launch ourselves into a warmer climate and inviting sea in July, evenwe are enviably lithe and toned.Obviously,I felt I was getting too heavy, Irsquod feel obliged to knuckle down and deal with it, whatever the date. It is true also that the majority of us could probably benefit from tweaking our menus around the margins. But the longest, blackest and dreariest month of the year is not the time to begin. It is counterintuitive, and possibly even self-defeating, to ask us to turn ourselves into a new and better version of ourselves, ldquothe best me I can be, when our internal clock is on perpetual snooze, coming alive only at the smell of roasted potatoes. When night descends by mid afternoon, and we have barely enough oomph to empty the dishwasher, let alone turn the kitchen into a MasterChef set, our willpower is posted missing.Perhaps I ought simply to bypass the magazine features that show vegetable slurries greener than a David Hockney landscape, or chargrilled chicken served with an acre of al dente field. Yet it is not the promise of slimness that lures me in but the ever-changing science of food. That, and the thought of the guinea pigs who allow themselves to become living laboratories. One such group is the cohort of older women cited in the German science writer Bas Kastrsquos new book, called The Diet Compass.These grandmothers were each given a muffin a day for seven weeks. One lot was baked with sunflower oil, the other with palm oil. Unsurprisingly, everyone gained weight, but those in the second category grew fattest. More cheering is Kastrsquos discovery thatyoursquore over , a very small glass of white wine with dinner works like a catalytic converter, in terms of cholesterol and insulin.

The blue tits, obviously, impatiently watching me replenish the feeders. And the chaffinches sometimes therersquos more than  of them outside the window. And the woodpecker, running up the tree, and the nuthatch, running down it. And the guest stars: a jay, magpies, doves, corvids, and the wagtails that nested in a hole in my wall. And finally, the A-lister: a robin who poses on the bench like itrsquos a throne.In the last couple of weeks, there have been some newcomers too. A linnet with a breast almost as bright as the robinrsquos and the dowdier female with her go-fast stripes on her chest. And there have been a few house sparrows too, which is a new thing for me in the middle of the country. House sparrows tend to stick to towns, but I can see a few of them checking out the hebe by the window as a potential holiday home. Theyrsquore very welcome to it. I hope they stay.I hope, too, that their presence is a good sign. Sixty years ago, the house sparrow was the most numerous bird in Britain, but the population has declined by  per cent. Fortunately, the situation appears to have stabilised more recently and part of that may be down to more of us putting out birdfeeders in our gardens: sales of feeders and food have increased big-time during the lockdowns.Obviously, all of this is good for the birds, but itrsquos good for us too. A study was published in Germany a few days ago showing a connection between birds and human happiness ndash the more birds you can see and hear around you, said the report, the more satisfied yoursquore likely to be with your le. It also concluded that the effect of more birds is as great as the effect of more money. But then I could have told them that.Irsquod also like to tell you about some of the things Irsquove learned about helping the birds: a few of the tips that experts in the RSPB and other organisations have passed on to me over the years. The first of them is that you should keep your feeders filled all year round, not just in the winter. In the summer, a lot of the birdsrsquo diet will be made up of insects, but even then every little extra bit helps.The second tip could be more dficult: donrsquot be so neat and tidy. A lot of birds feed on the scraps that humans leave behind, and use the hedges in our gardens as shelter, and for food, and for nesting ndash the ordinary garden is a birdrsquos fortress and kitchen and nursery. So donrsquot leave your hedges too trim and neat ndash leave spaces for the birds to get in and out. And put scraps and leftovers out on the birdtable. It will all be appreciated.Maybe we could check our attitudes too. We know the British people love birds, but we also know we have a confused attitude to them. We put up bird tables but put spikes on buildings to discourage pigeons. We celebrate the robin but decry the gull. The hen harrier is killed to protect the right to kill the grouse. Perhaps we could stop trying to impose our rules on the birds. Perhaps we could step back and realise they are all the same. Perhaps we could look at the birds and learn.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

And found that online banking failed to log out consumers when switching to a dferent site .It also found that the website failed to log out consumers when switching to a dferent website or using the forward back button to leave the session andto it.TSB finished second from bottom with a score of  per cent.But the research found that TSB customers do at least enjoy some \"peace of mind\" due to the bankrsquos fraud refund guarantee, which ensures the \"vast majority\" of scam victims get their money back.Santander rounded off the bottom three, with a score of  per cent. Testers found that authentication checks when logging in can be bypasseda user designates a device as lsquotrustedrsquo.It was the not so big names that performed better.Starling came out on top, with a score of  per cent. Experts found nothing concerning with its recently launched online banking website.But they said this is partly due to limited ality, as users can only change sensitive data via the app.Unlike most banks, there were no issues with missing security headers and it scored top marks for encryption.Which  is calling for the voluntary bank transfer scams code to be overhauled so that stronger consumer protections and reimbursement for fraud victims become mandatory for all banks and payment providers.The code developed by the banking industry and consumer groups and launched in May, , compensates those who are tricked into transferring money directly to a fraudster, in situations where neither the victim, nor their bank, is to blame.Previously, victims of authorised push paymentscams had lost large amounts of cash forever, because they had authorised the transfer and so were not entitled to claim the money back from their bank.More than pound. million has been reimbursed to thousands of customers since the code was introduced.But concerns persist that banks are not applying the code in a unorm manner and may sometimes be interpreting the code too narrowly by expecting customers to have sophisticated financial knowledge or relying on customers seeing generic scam warnings as a reason to turn down claims.Which  said the FCA should be required to regularly publish reimbursement rates of inidual banks so consumers can check on their account providerrsquos performance.Many of the banks included in the investigation were signed up to the industry code on bank transfer scams, which pledges to reimburse scam victims who are not at fault.However, the number of victims who get their money ed by banks is worryingly low, standing at around the  per cent mark, the consumer organisation said.Because firms apply the code inconsistently and are not required to publish their reimbursement rates, scam victims face a \"lottery\" when it comes to getting their money back, it said.Harry Rose, editor of Which  said: ldquoBanks must lead the battle against fraud, yet our security tests have revealed a big gap between the best and worst providers when it comes to keeping people safe from the threat of having their account compromised.ldquoThe serious failings we have exposed with some providers reinforce the need for banks to up their game on scam protections, and for greater transparency and stronger standards on fraud reimbursement to be made mandatory for all banks and payment providers.TSB said: \"Providing customers with safe and secure banking is a priority and we continue to invest in strengthening online and mobile protection for customers.\"We are the only bank that offers a guarantee to refund all innocent victims of fraud ndash including those who lose money to online scams.\"Tesco Bank said it will consider the findings when prioritising \"potential areas for further enhancement\" to customer security this year \"against other customer and risk priorities\"\"At Tesco Bank, we take the security of our customers very seriously. Many of the security measures we use on customersrsquo behalf are not visible to external parties, and these measures invalidate a number of the findings of this survey. Customers can be assured we have robust security measures in place to protect them and their accounts.ldquoWe use the latest technology to protect and manage the security of online banking and our mobile banking app, giving customers peace of mind they can bank safely and securely with us.

Although the population of the UAEs cosmopolitan city is largely expatriate, foreigners were still subject to strict laws.

It seems it was decided in some places, lsquoah schools are closed, we donrsquot need to spend that money anymorersquo, even though John Swinney has put additional money in to aid education recovery.ldquoThatrsquos what I would call sharp practice.There have also been reports of schools asking all teachers to come in to look after key worker and vulnerable children, even though Scottish Government guidance species that attendance should be restricted to staff necessary for the implementation of revised reopening arrangements.Mr Searson said: ldquoWersquove had schools in some local authorities ndash even up to [Tuesday] night ndash telling all of their staff to come in because they hadnrsquot established exactly how many key worker and vulnerable children they would have to look after.ldquoWe expect most schools to know how many children would fall into the key worker or vulnerable category.He added: ldquoHopefully common sense is beginning to prevail on this issue. The problem is that the guidance has been woolly and ministers have been saying itrsquos up to local authorities.Mr Searson also warned that consideration would have to be given to overhauling arrangements for additional support needspupils in special schools.ldquoStaff and children in these schools need all the protection that can possibly be provided, he said.ldquoThat may mean that, in those schools, we only have one teacher working with a particular group of children, that they create their own bubble.ldquoMaybe we have to move to the point where itrsquos accepted that not all ASN pupils can be in school all of the time.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoWe have provided guidance for early learning and childcare settings, schools and local authorities on communicating with and reporting to parents during Covid- and supporting parents and pupils with learning at home during Covid-.ldquoWe have invested pound million to address digital exclusion and so far more than , devices have been distributed, and the programme in total is expected to deliver around , devices for disadvantaged children and young people.ldquoThe definition of vulnerable children includes those with additional support needs.

Loganair has recruited and trained engineers locally to take over from retiring long-serving members of its team and is committed to continuing this policy of local investment in Orkney wherever it possibly can. During the new contract, Loganair has said it fully expects to convert the aircraft to use low-carbon propulsion to replace the same type of conventional piston engine which has powered the services for over  years. Loganair is a key participant in several projects to bring low or zero-carbon technology to commercial air transport, and will be supporting flight trials of two separate programmes # hydrogen-powered and electrically-powered aircraft # at its base in the Orkney Islands in the first half of .It is the only UK regional airline invited to participate in the UK Government’s Jet Zero Council initiatives to de-carbonise future air travel.Loganair chief executive Jonathan Hinkles said: “We’re delighted and privileged to have been chosen to deliver Orkney’s essential Inter-Island air services for a further four years.   It’s a vital service for the prosperity of the North Isles, and our ability to retain this contract is entirely due to the experience and hard work of our dedicated team in Kirkwall.“The four-year contract award provides us with certainty on which to plan for the future – whether that be the transition to new low or zero-carbon technology or in the recruitment and training of staff in Orkney to work on the Inter-Isles operation.   The North Isles services are a key part of Loganair’s DNA, and despite our expansion as an airline, we remain today as committed as ever to serving the communities of Orkney.”OIC chairman of development and infrastructure, Councillor Graham Sinclair said: “Communities in our North Isles have been served by Loganair for more than half a century and now, following a competitive tendering process, the airline has been awarded the four-year contract once again.“In these ever-challenging times with uncertainty around every corner, I am sure the continuity of service will be welcomed by residents.“I also welcome Loganair’s future plans which include conversion to use of low-carbon propulsion which can only but assist with our attempts to reduce our carbon footprint.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those who will be aged - by  March  can avail of the jab from over  community pharmacies or through their local GP practice.Health Minister Robin Swann said: “We have seen an increased uptake in the flu vaccine programme this year and whilst this is very encouraging it remains extremely important that we take all necessary measures to help reduce the spread of flu.“This is especially true given the very high levels of Covid- transmission in our communities. Reducing the pressure caused by seasonal flu will help protect our health service and save lives.”Minister Swann continued: “This week has also seen GP practices begin the first phase in the Covid- population vaccination programme. Given the scale of the vaccination programme and the delivery schedule of the vaccines it will take time to vaccinate a substantial proportion of the population. I would ask people to remain patient, wait to be called and appreciate that GP practices will be delivering the signicant Covid- programme alongside their normal service. Bearing this in mind, people in this group can also avail of the flu jab, through participating community pharmacies.”Acknowledging the hard work of GP practices and pharmacies in delivering the flu programme to date, Minister Swann said: “I want to pay tribute to GP practice teams and community pharmacies who have worked throughout the pandemic to vaccinate those most vulnerable in our community. I also want to acknowledge the increased role pharmacy teams will play in vaccinating this additional group which will allow GP practices to concentrate on rolling out the Covid- vaccination programme.”The current groups eligible for a free flu vaccination from their GP are now everyone aged  and over, pregnant women, those aged under  years of age in clinical “at risk” groups, all children aged  to , primary school pupils and school children in year  who missed the school vaccination, household contacts of those who received shielding letters and frontline health and social care workers.

Under the NI Protocol, companies sending parcels here have to complete customs declarations. While a three-month grace period is in force, it was not announced until shortly before the protocol began to apply at pm last Thursday.But freight boss Seamus Leheny of Logistics UK dismissed a call by North Antrim DUP MP Ian Paisley that the protocol should be dropped.Other problems including snarl-ups at ports in Great Britain for lorries carrying food to Northern Ireland were discussed at a hearing of the NI Affairs Committee yesterday.Mr Leheny told the committee that one company had  loads of food bound for here which could not be lted by the hauliers because there was no accompanying paperwork. He said a breakdown in communications between government agencies and the industry in Great Britain has helped create delays.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDUP MP Ian Paisley FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDUP MP Ian PaisleyMany companies there had wrongly believed the grace periods to help the flow of supermarket goods into NI meant no documentation at all was required. However, pre-notications to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsare still required.There is a yawning gap in the knowledge of those in Great Britain exporting to NI, said Mr Leheny.Mr Paisley said that the complications seen in the first few days of the protocol meant that it should be scrapped.A blind man on a galloping horse could have told you this would be a nightmare, he said.But Mr Leheny said there was no realistic alternative. You can#t just walk away and think something  will be better.He added: Industry here did support the backstop but the protocol is where we ended up because every alternative was rejected. The view of our industry is, let#s make it work.But despite reports of delays, a spokesman for the UK Government told the Belfastthe grace periods for supermarkets and their suppliers are working well. Lorries are travelling through NI ports and we continue to work closely with traders as they adapt to these changes.The overwhelming majority of parcels continue to move smoothly, and there is no reason for businesses not to continue to send such goods to NI.The Government is understood to see the three-month grace period from official certication for parcels as a sensible phased solution.However, operators are being urged to carry out movements in compliance with full requirements as soon as they can.The flow of goods is being monitored by HMRC. A Government source said the priority is to have a pragmatic approach that allows us to comply with the protocol without causing undue disruption to businesses and citizens. Crona Clohisey, public policy lead at Chartered Accountants Ireland, urged traders to ensure they have correct documentation, and use the Government#s Trader Support Service for help with the system for moving goods from Great Britain to NI.The reality is that while the UK and EU have concluded a free trade agreement, the NI Protocol brings a whole host of new trading rules to crucially enable frictionless trading on the island of Ireland, she said. Customs declarations are now required when goods are moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland because NI must comply with EU customs and VAT rules at its ports.Belfast Most ReadSnowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne MountainsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRAMeet Belfast family of seven who can#t all gather in their own garden according to Stormont coronavirus guidelinesNI school chef allegedly raped boy and took photo to ensure his silence, court toldLatest BrexitBrexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea borderIan Paisley and Claire Hanna in name calling row over ditching NI Protocol Post-Brexit premises in Larne ready by autumn#Blind man on a galloping horse# could have foreseen problems with NI Protocol, Ian Paisley saysLatest from Belfast Aston Villa’s FA Cup clash with Liverpool in doubt after coronavirus outbreakPublic urged to support health service as hospitals treat , Covid patients, Covid- vaccines administered in IrelandNHS boss cites extra , Covid patients since Christmas as staff share woesCalls for an acceleration in Covid- vaccine programme in nursing homes,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Union said it is essential both to help protect teachers and their pupils but to allow the country to move to a situation where children are back in schools and colleges, minimising the disruption to their education.The NASUWT has presented evidence showing that staff working in both secondary and primary schools are far more likely to be infected than the wider community, with rates of virus prevalence amongst school staff between three and four times higher than the prevalence rate for adults.Read MorePSNI still waiting on new coronavirus laws enforcing stay-at-home orderUp to one in  may have Covid in parts of Northern Ireland, scientist warnsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedNASUWT General Secretary Dr Patrick Roach said: “Teachers and education staff are unable to practice social distancing from their pupils and few are provided with essential PPE as part of their day-to-day roles. “With provision for younger age children and for children with special and additional learning needs, it is clear that there are additional risks present which are comparable to those that exist in the provision of health and social care.”He said that while it is right that health and social care staff are prioritised, teachers must also be identied as a priority group for the vaccine.“Through the autumn term, we have seen a bad situation getting worse by the day,” said Dr Roach.“Now, at the start of , the position is as badnot worse than it was in March.“The impact on this generation of children and young people should not be underestimated and, it is our view, that everything that can be done should be done to ensure the safe and sustainable resumption of school and college-based education for all pupils as quickly as possible.“We have seen too much disruption to childrens# education. Whilst teachers are doing everything that is being asked of them, they also deserve the same levels of protection in the face of this highly deadly and highly contagious virus.”Education Minister Peter Weir has already said he would support the call for teachers to receive vaccinations as quickly as possible.The minister said he would support any measures that would allow teachers and school staff to receive Covid vaccinations early. “It would be helpfulthat was made a priority, but the decision on who is vaccinated and when is made centrally between the four nations, it’s not a call I or Health Minister Robin Swann can make,” he said.“I would be in favour of anything that lessens the anxiety staff in schools are feeling.“I am hopeful that the logistics on the ground will be speeded up to allow the vaccination process to be turbo-charged. Anything that makes those working in education feel safer and more confident would be welcomed.“Education staff are all key workers and there is no intention to alter that.”NASUWT National Official Northern Ireland, Justin McCamphill said staff who are still working face to face with pupils need to be protected, particularly those working in special schools.“It is in the interest of wider public health that all teachers and education staff are prioritised in the roll-out of the Coronavirus vaccines,” he said.“It is particularly important for staff in special schools and all those working face-to-face with children and young people right now.“Getting schools open again as soon as possible, without further disruption, means not only that lessons need to be learned, but also that credible and sustainable solutions are implemented.“This means that tougher control measures will be needed to ensure workplace safety, together with priority roll out of the Coronavirus vaccines to all frontline education staff in order to minimise further disruption to children’s education.”Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fad-fffe-ae-bc-fbd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fad-fffe-ae-bc-fbd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fad-fffe-ae-bc-fbd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fad-fffe-ae-bc-fbd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fad-fffe-ae-bc-fbd_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedA further  people in Northern Ireland have died after testing positive for Covid- and , new cases of the virus have been reported.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bdd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_adadb-cb-a-adc-abf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bdd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_adadb-cb-a-adc-abf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bdd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_adadb-cb-a-adc-abf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bdd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_adadb-cb-a-adc-abf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bdd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_adadb-cb-a-adc-abf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandUp to one in  may have Covid in parts of Northern Ireland, scientist warnsAs many as one in  people may have coronavirus in some parts of Northern Ireland, the region’s chief scientic adviser has warned.CoronavirusPSNI still waiting on new coronavirus laws enforcing stay-at-home orderPolice have yet to see regulations around new powers set to be introduced at midnight on Thursday allowing them to curb non-essential travel.

I would believe that employers wishing to do the right thing should accept previous shielding letters as indication that somebody needs to shield until such time as any further communication is resolved.His comments prompted a flurry of anxious responses on social media from members of the public and charities that support vulnerable members of society.However, a spokesman from the Department of Health subsequently issued a statement to clary that the latest advice dfers from the advice that was originally issued to clinically extremely vulnerable people in March last year.It recommended that anyone advised to shield adhere to strict measures, including staying indoors at all times and limiting contact with members of their household.A statement released on Wednesday night said: Prof Young was referring to the updated advice to clinically extremely vulnerable people issued just before Christmas - with a commitment that letters from the chief medical officer would follow. Some of these letters have already been received.While not ato the shielding advice in place in the early part of the pandemic, the updated Northern Ireland advice does mirror the latest advice in England.Sinn Fein MLA Colm Gildernew, chair of the health committee, on Wednesday night described the confusion over the issue as regrettable.It is slightly dferent revised advice and it is regrettable that people who are vulnerable have felt confused and unclear about the advice, he said.According to the latest guidance, clinical extremely vulnerable people should avoid going to shops, pharmacies and hospitality settings. They should also work from home where possible.The measures were put in place on December  but updated information has not yet been sent out to all the , people who were told to shield last June.Meanwhile, Northern Ireland looks set to remain in lockdown until March at the earliest as Prof Young revealed his fears that Covid- will still be out of control at the end of February.Professor Young has given the clearest indication yet that the draconian restrictions put in place to stem the surge in Covid- cases will not come to an end on February .The Executive Office announced on Tuesday that the additional restrictions would be reviewed on January  and will remain in place until February .However, speaking at the health committee on Wednesday, Prof Young said he expects virus levels to remain signicant at the end of February.Prof Young also revealed that a failure to implement the latest lockdown would have resulted in Northern Ireland#s health service being overrun by patients for three months. And he warned that hospitals will experience a surge in patients at the end of the month.It comes as a further , cases and  deaths were announced by the Department of Health on Wednesday.During Wednesday#s committee meeting, Prof Young came under fire from Sinn Fein MLA Pat Sheehan, who said the strategy put in place by Prof Young, Health Minister Robin Swann and chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride to respond to the pandemic had failed miserably.The CSA said: Do I wish we could have done better  Absolutely. Would there be decisions which I could have been taken dferently looking backwards  Without a doubt.When asked to expand further by Mr Sheehan, Prof Young continued: So, I think that right towards the beginning of the epidemic, on a UK-wide and Ireland-wide basis, there might have been some merit in taking action around travel at that stage, before the virus had become very well established in the country, that#s one thing.I think certainly that we would look back and think might have been done dferently although those are policy decisions, they would have been informed by advice.I wish that we had got the testing developed more rapidly and rolled out more rapidly given all the limitations of it because I think more testing earlier in the epidemic would have been very helpful in terms of trying to keep it under control.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Coronavirus PremiumFlouting coronavirus rules like #slapping a nurse in the face,# rages Health Minister SwannHealth Minister Robin Swann has fired a warning at those who continue to flout health regulations, saying that they might as well be slapping a nurse in the face.Most ReadSnowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne MountainsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRAMeet Belfast family of seven who can#t all gather in their own garden according to Stormont coronavirus guidelinesNI school chef allegedly raped boy and took photo to ensure his silence, court toldLatest CoronavirusBelfast Trust cancels all planned surgeries this week due to CovidTeachers# union wants school staff to be at front of queue for Covid- vaccineMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed cases of Covid- in your council areaPSNI still waiting on new coronavirus laws enforcing stay-at-home orderTranslink cuts bus and train services for second time after Stormont stay at home orderLatest from Belfast Fishing is form of ‘exercise’ so permitted during lockdown – angling groupStudents and teaching unions condemn plans to reopen schools for Leaving CertRecord daily total for deaths in US as coronavirus surges in nearly every stateSchools told not to limit number of key worker children onsite during lockdownUK ‘not missing out on crime intelligence’ since Brexit,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And children aged  and under are not counted in this total.Speaking to the Belfastdad of five Pol Gallagher said his family has been left bemused.It#s a total mess, making decisions changing decisions, he said. Stormont needs to get these things right. It#s undermining efforts of people trying to abide by what the lockdown restrictions actually are.On Wednesday in the Assembly First Minister Arlene Foster gave an overview of the new restrictions and when referencing the number of people who can gather in a garden Mrs Foster said that the Department of Health was working through the details and there would be clarity to come on the matter.On Wednesday night the NI Direct website was updated with the latest restrictions which remain in place until February  and will be reviewed on January .It also said that everyone must now stay at home unless they had a reasonable excuse.Earlier the head of the police federation Mark Lindsay questioned the practicality of the PSNI being able to enforce the new regulations and whether officers had the power to cross the threshold of a residence.He told the BBC#s Stephen Nolan show: We have been quite disappointed over the past year in some of the legislation that we think has been rushed, hasn#t been properly thought through, and police are left to pick up the pieces.Mr Lindsay said it would be easiertravel restrictions were in place in that officers could tell from someone#s driving licensethey were in breach of regulations.He questioned how is it practical to enforce gatherings in gardens of hundreds of thousands of homes - many of which are inaccessible. However Justice Minister Naomi Long told MLAs yesterday that officers did have the power of entry.The health protection regulations as laid by the department of health gave those tasked with enforcement the power to take any actions necessary to enforce any legal restrictions and it is the view of the Executive that that includes the right of power of entry, she told MLAs.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Coronavirus PremiumFlouting coronavirus rules like #slapping a nurse in the face,# rages Health Minister SwannHealth Minister Robin Swann has fired a warning at those who continue to flout health regulations, saying that they might as well be slapping a nurse in the face.Most ReadSnowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne MountainsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRAMeet Belfast family of seven who can#t all gather in their own garden according to Stormont coronavirus guidelinesNI school chef allegedly raped boy and took photo to ensure his silence, court toldLatest CoronavirusBelfast Trust cancels all planned surgeries this week due to CovidTeachers# union wants school staff to be at front of queue for Covid- vaccineMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed cases of Covid- in your council areaPSNI still waiting on new coronavirus laws enforcing stay-at-home orderTranslink cuts bus and train services for second time after Stormont stay at home orderLatest from Belfast Warning issued to pet owners after food laced with poison found in Dundonald car park Robert Snodgrass can be West Brom’s Gary Speed, says Sam AllardyceTed Danson discusses his admiration for we Mary SteenburgenBoris Johnson pledges unprecedented effort to roll out Covid- vaccinesFishing is form of ‘exercise’ so permitted during lockdown – angling group,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He had actually sent copies of them off to Walt Disney and got a very polite rejection letter but he was very proud of the fact he got a letter with Walt Disney#s signature on the bottom.Terry adored his grandchildren Patrick, Peter, Craig and Rory, and Paul believes he must have dug out some of his old Bubble Fairy stories to tell them when they were young.Paul said Gail used her free time in lockdown to start typing her father#s notes and the family decided to use his most complete stories to use as the basis for The Bubble Fairy.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseTerry Moorhead#s daughter Gail FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueTerry Moorhead#s daughter Gail Hats off to Gail, it was no mean feat, because she#s partially sighted, added Paul. Deciphering my dad#s scribbles in pencil on old pieces of paper was not at all easy for her.She typed it up and we thought we would do a family vanity project for dad.He was obviously published a lot through print journalism but he never got to publish the book, which would have been a thrill for him.My sister just thought to gather everything he had written as best as we can, put it in a book and get it published.The book#s illustrations were drawn by Patrick, who is in his final year of animation at Ulster University. Peter completed the design and layout, Paul was responsible for production and Gail was in charge of editing the final book.Paul said his only regret is that his mother and father didn#t get the chance to see The Bubble Fairy.We#d like to think that he#s up there somewhere and we#ve done him credit, he continued. For it to be a project that involved his own grandchildren, I think that would have blown him away.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseTerry Moorhead#s son Paul FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueTerry Moorhead#s son Paul The real collaboration was between Patrick and his granddad since it#s their creative input that has made it what it is.My own, Gail#s and Peter#s involvement has been much more mechanical through editing, layout and production.The creative aspect really has spanned the generation from grandfather to grandson.Patrick is the youngest and actually knew my dad least. He describes it as not having memories so much but more memories of memories after seeing videos and hearing stories about him.In a loving tribute, the family also included some photos of Terry with his grandchildren at the end of the book.Only  copies of The Bubble Fairy were printed to give to friends and family for Christmas Day but Paul saidthe feedback is positive then they will consider publishing it on a wider scale.Belfast Most ReadSnowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne MountainsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRAMeet Belfast family of seven who can#t all gather in their own garden according to Stormont coronavirus guidelinesNI school chef allegedly raped boy and took photo to ensure his silence, court toldLatest Northern Ireland#Fisticuffs you#d see at Ulster Says No protest#: Belfast cameraman who filmed inside Capitol as mob ragedOperations cancelled at Northern Ireland hospitals due to coronavirus casesPublic worship suspended in NI until next monthHauliers warn they are being ‘overwhelmed’ by paperwork following BrexitBrexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea borderLatest from Belfast Robert Snodgrass can be West Brom’s Gary Speed, says Sam AllardyceTed Danson discusses his admiration for we Mary SteenburgenFishing is form of ‘exercise’ so permitted during lockdown – angling groupASTI directs teachers not to comply with plans to teach in schools three days a weekRecord daily total for deaths in US as coronavirus surges in nearly every state,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I wasn#t a fool to this, but someone  once said to me: #What made you do the arrangements with the former terrorist Martin McGuinness #And I said: #The word former#.Julie Hambleton#s sister Maxine was one of  people killed in the IRA Birmingham pub bombings in .

Barman Andy Nutt is preparing to pour the last measure at the well-known local pub.Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Dec   addthis, Knobbsrsquo Tavern closed in March, just before the pandemic arrived. In the week leading up to its final hurrah, we caught up with barman Andy Nutt and a few regulars.A well-known County Derry pub that has been in operation since  will close its door for the final time on Thursday.Knobbs’ Tavern in Kildoag, between Claudy and Donemana, was originally a grocery store that serviced the local area, but the community it sustained has been shrinking.On Saturday, they held a packed farewell concert, and when the County Derry Post caught up with a few of the regulars on the Friday afternoon, they were in reflective mood.“We’ll miss the yarns and the company,” said previous owner, Jack Knobbs, who was perched at the corner of the bar with his dog, Honey.“It was originally what they call a licensed shop and the first time it was opened as a bar was in . Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.” googletag.cmd.push Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. googletag.cmd.push  “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed. “It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!     “I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble. “I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above. There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. googletag.cmd.push The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. googletag.cmd.push By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore.     “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear. Im in shock here, but Id just like to thank the staff, and in particular Fionas childrens teachers. “Theres a fantastic team in Year  who made children feel comfortable in coming back to school. “Its been tough, but everybody has gone above and beyond from teachers, classroom assistants, our building supervisors and cleaners. “Im going to relay this to all the staff because it will lt everybodys spirits,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When she was two and a half she asked Santa for a moo, neigh and a quack! “Her uncle built her a stable and Santa brought her a first Shetland pony when she was two and a half.” Dogs have always been part of Clionas le. After leaving school, Cliona completed a Diploma at Wizards of Dogs in Cookstown, where the experience was immersive. googletag.cmd.push “When I was training,a dog comes in that was biting or anything, we had to do it ourselves, to help us learn how to cope when we qualy,” she told the County Derry Post. “That prepared me for going out on my own when you get dogs like that you know how to deal with it. You just try your best to work with them and find a way that works better than what youve tried. “I couldnt have done it without the Wizard of Dogs, Ive learned so much. You do your first aid and start off grooming two dogs a day.     “By the end it was loads more, and I covered all the dferent cuts, so I got plenty of experience there,” she added. While dog groomers have been able to remain open throughout the latest raft of Covid- restrictions, Clionas sister, Nicole, hasnt been so lucky. “Her sister has a salon in Maghera and we were laughing that Cliona has only started and she can stay open whereas Nicole has to close,” explained Joanne. “We could maybe get her an odd dog to bath.” You can follow Fairy Tail Dog Grooming by visiting their Facebook and Instagram pages.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Several important areas of land on key entrances to the city are currently vacant. Derry City and Strabane District Council is now looking to set up the new  to ask their opinion on the design quality of any planning applications which are made for these sites. One of the sites expected to be discussed is the derelict site of the former Tillie and Henderson shirt factory at the cityside end of the Craigavon Bridge. googletag.cmd.push It emerged recently that the current owner of the site is to apply for planning permission to build an apartment complex on the land. Speaking at a meeting yesterday of the local councils Planning Committee, Eamon Molloy, the councils Head of Planning Performance and Improvement, outlined the proposal for the new advisory . He said the creation of such  had been put forward as part of a review of the Planning Service. Mr Molloy said the  would offer advice to councillors on important gateway sites in the council area. He said the setting up of such a  would also allow the council to be in a state of readiness for the post-Covid recovery period when, he said, there hopefully would be many opportunities in terms of development in the council area. googletag.cmd.push Mr Molloy told the meeting that he would be in contact with the Ministerial Advisory Group on Architecture and Built Environment to agree terms on how the proposed  would operate. He said he would bring a report on the matter to next months meeting of the Planning Committee. There has been much debate in recent years about the development of gateway sites in Derry. The Tillie and Henderson site, in particular, has been at the forefront of the discussions. The site has been unused since the derelict factory building was destroyed in a fire in . The owners of the site, Belfast-based Andras House, had originally planned to build a hotel on the site.     However, those plans never came to fruition and it emerged last month that Andras House has now teamed up with local developers, the Martin Property Group, to build an apartment complex on the site. Director of Andras House, Rajesh Rana, said a residential development is the most appropriate use that can be delivered at this time. Just across the road from the Tillie and Henderson site is another derelict piece of land which was also previously home to a shirt factory. This would also be regarded as a gateway site in Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Health Minister Robin Swann said:“We have seen an increased uptake in thefluvaccine programme this year and whilst this is very encouraging it remains extremely important that we take all necessary measures to help reduce the spread offlu. “This is especially true given the very high levels of Covid- transmission in our communities.

Bearing this in mind, people in this group can also avail of theflujab, through participating community pharmacies.” Acknowledging the hard work of GP practices and pharmacies in delivering thefluprogramme to date, Minister Swann said:“I want to pay tribute to GP practice teams and community pharmacies who have worked throughout the pandemic to vaccinate those most vulnerable in our community. googletag.cmd.push I also want to acknowledge the increased role pharmacy teams will play in vaccinating this additional group which will allow GP practices to concentrate on rolling out the Covid- vaccination programme.” The current groups eligible for a freefluvaccination from their GP are now everyone aged  and over, pregnant women, those aged under  years of age in clinical “at risk” groups, all children aged  to , primary school pupils and school children in year  who missed the school vaccination, household contacts of those who received shielding letters and frontline health and social care workers.

I would implore that everyone plays their part, stays at home, follow the guidelines and take the vaccine.ldquoWe are absolutely slaughtered in hospitals and those big numbers of new cases will feed into admissions and we are already at capacity.ldquoA fortnight from now, a proportion of the new cases will end up in hospital and hospitals have not yet had the chance to get out of surge two and we are straight into surge three.The local councillor spoke of her personal relief at being vaccinated.ldquoAt the moment Irsquove only got the first jab which I will get the second in about  weeks time. But % or so protection is better than none.ldquoI view it as a great blessing and we have to be very grateful to our scientists who have worked around the clock to get us where we are today.The DUP councillor said she experienced no issues from having the vaccine.She confirmed that her vaccination team are doing around  vaccinations a day and that hospital staff will be rolling out the Pfizer vaccine while Gps will be responsible for administering the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine.ldquoWe have our doctors and nurses taking the vaccine and these are healthcare professionals who understand the rigorous testing that all new drugs go through, said Cllr Owen. ldquoThey are putting their money where their mouth is and at the end of the day so am I.ldquoIrsquom happy to stand over this to encourage others in the uptake. Itrsquos our way out of this nightmare that we are all in.Her one regret is that her husband and children are not been yet vaccinated from the virus.She added: ldquoThey will have to wait their turn but I am the one in the family whorsquos probably at the highest risk as I work on wards and could be bringing it home.

I thought this group without doubt deserved more. They are outstanding and deserve a Christmas performance so I went about to make this happen, he explained.ldquoI decided to put on a show for the children as for some of my class this would be their final hurrah in an eagerly anticipated Christmas play with a dference.Mr McGarrity said St Malachyrsquos had previously used green screen technology and he set about organising an ldquoamazing surprise to mash the school play and green screen technology together to make a Christmas show.ldquoThe boys and girls were so excited and overall delighted to be taking part in a somewhat dferent type of production, he said.And with only three weeksrsquo practice before the Christmas holidays they pulled it out of the bag, planning, ing and deliveringlsquoScroogehellipA Ghost of a Chance rsquo, which was screened via YouTube.Mr McGarrity said the link for the recent screening was shared with families, local community groups and care homes as the pupils wanted their story to be heard across the country in a time of need.The primary school teacher said the school was also keen to promote festive cheer and good old Christmas spirit, especially in these unprecedented times, bringing hope and joy to all families. young and old.The St Malachyrsquos production can be viewed at https:youtu.be vsNXbepVw and the school is hoping it will help put a smile on peoplersquos faces..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2021 Ballykinlar.jpg","title":"Ballykinlar is key to future in Down  ","story":"DOWN GAA county secretary Sean Og McAteer has said there potential for ldquoimaginative funding ahead of what is likely to be a very testing year financially at inter-county level.All sporting bodies found their funds hit last year by the spread of covid- and the impact that had.With sport shelved for a large part of the year, and the same happening again in the early part of , it continues to be a trying time.With the virus still posing a signicant threat going into the new year, it is likely that sport at all levels will continue to see many dficulties going forward.Conor Murray, an Irish Research Council Postgraduate scholar at the School of History and Geography at Dublin City University, has been analysing numbers from the GAArsquos annual financial reports from -.He has calculated the levels of grant money given to each county to fund games development and expenses.Whilst at the top end of the scale, Dublinrsquos figure sits at euro. million for the period, for Down the figure is a much more modest euro,, putting them in bottom place.Mr McAteer said Downrsquos expenditure was in no way comparable with that of other counties.ldquoWe are on the low side of the money list, no doubt, he admitted. ldquoWe certainly have the ambition to begin to address the deficit. We want to be able to develop our coaching set-up, particularly in urban centres like Downpatrick, Newry, north Down, the Down parts of Belfast. Hopefully those opportunities will come up.Mr McAteer said the implementation of a Down training hub at Ballykinlar was a key aim when it comes to considering where spending will take place in Down GAA.ldquoThe development at Ballykinlar is a huge thing, both for Down and the community in Ballykinlar. That is one of the key fronts we are working on, he said.ldquoOf course though, we cannot take our eye of the importance of development in urban areas. We can see how much Dublin for example have benefited from utilising their urban areas, and the rewards they have reaped from that in recent years on the pitch, as well as financially.He did caution that, as ever, the availability of funding is major issue.ldquoThe GAA took a huge hit financially in  - that is likely to happen to some degree at least, again this year.ldquoIn terms of us here in Down though, we are in a stronger position to deal with the climate I would like to think, certainly when compared to other northern counties.ldquoWe have big urban centres which is vitally important. We can also explore the possibility of greater cross-border development with counties like Louth, and the use of the Dublin Institute of Technology. There is, going forward this year, a lot of potential for imaginative funding that we can use to our advantage here in Down.Another cornerstone of the approach to keeping Down GAA in good health is continuing to appeal to the younger generations coming through in the Mourne county.ldquoWe need to try to make Gaelic Games the number one sport of choice for young kids in Down, Mr McAteer said.ldquoIf you look at our record from July of  to the end of the year, we staged , games. A lot of those games were at an under-age level. Some clubs have got very very strong groups of kids at very young ages.ldquoWhat we need to do is to ensure that those young people who come into the GAA in Down at that stage stay with it into adulthood.ldquoOur games need to be attractive and innovative going forward.ldquoThat means we all need to keep pushing, keep the facilities as good as possible and promoting ourselves as well as we can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit deal is ‘best of both worlds’ for local fishermen  ","story":"THE Brexit fisheries deal with the European Union is good news for the Ardglass fishing industry.Thatrsquos the view of former fishermenrsquos leader Dick James, who says Ardglass and the other Co Down fishing ports can look to the future with confidence.Mr James, former chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, says an increase in quotas for key catches will benefit fishermen.At the same time the non-imposition of tarfs on exported fish to EU markets, will underpin the future of the processing industry.Mr James that while some areas of the UK had done badly from the Brexit deal, local fishermen should be pleased with the outcome.ldquoThe deal is good news for our fishermen and should secure investment and new jobs in the industry, he said.In the Irish Sea the amount of herring which can be caught by UK fishermen will rise from the current figure of % to % in  and % in .In the crucial prawn sector, the UK quota for Area , which includes the Irish Sea, will go from % currently to % in  and % in .There will also be increases in the UK quotas for other types of fish, including haddock, cod and whiting.Mr James said: ldquoWe have got the best of both worlds. Our fishermen can land more fish and we can continue to trade with the Continent relatively unfettered.ldquoThis is particularly important when you consider that most of the prawns we catch locally are exported to Spain.Mr James said the deal has already boosted confidence. ldquoI know of one new boat coming to Ardglass and we are looking at another two, he said.ldquoThe increase in the herring quota secures the future of two herring processing factories in Ardglass and another in Kilkeel.ldquoThis deal guarantees the future of fishing in Ardglass and should encourage more local people to seek employment in the industry.Mr James said it would also add impetus to the campaign for improvements to the harbour in Ardglass.These include deepening the harbour, improving berthing and landing facilities and providing berthing pontoons for smaller vessels..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Calls on public to take coronavirus vaccine  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH man has become one of the first student nurses in the UK to receive the Covid- vaccine.James Savage is now urging local people and fellow health professionals to take up the offer of the potentially le-saving jab as soon as itrsquos made available to them.The  year-old student nurse got his vaccine over the weekend while working part-time as a senior staff member at Ringdufferin Nursing Home near Killyleagh.The former Member of the UK Youth Parliamentfor Strangford, James has recently been elected to the Students Committee of the Royal College of Nursing.He represents the North West region as he attends Liverpool John Moores University where he hopes to qualy in a few years time as a mental health nurse.His call to encourage others to take up the vaccine also comes from his own experience of contacting the virus last March and his sadness over losing his grandmother to Covid- last April, as well as some patients.James, who has worked as a carer in nursing homes since he was , said: ldquoThe vaccine is the best hope for us to overcome challenges currently facing the country.ldquoIrsquove worked in a nursing home during a major outbreak here after which I volunteered as a student nurse to take up a post in the NHS working on the wards helping to care for mental health patients.ldquoDuring my time working in health care and as a student nurse over the last five years, I have had to face many challenges. However, the personal and professional ones I have faced over the last year have been something .I like many in the country have had Covid-, luckily I recovered but like too many, I also lost a beloved family member due to this disease.James received his vaccination at Ringdufferin where he works when he s home for during university breaks. Patients in care homes have been severely affected from Covid- during the pandemic and residents and their staff were chosen by the government to be amongst the first to be vaccinated.He explained: ldquoWhen it came to my attention that I was one of the few student nurses to have received the vaccine at this stage so with my new role as a student ambassador I believed it was important to encourage all student nurses and all NHS workers and of course, all local people, to take up the opportunity to have the vaccine.ldquoThese vaccines are the best chance we have to tackle this pandemic head on. I have personally seen the dedication and strength of our NHS and health care staff across the country.ldquoTheir fortitude and courage have propped up the country in what are indeed dire times. The ability of the nursing profession to overcome adversity is truly great. I am truly thankful for those who cared for my grandmother.James, who often dresses up as Santa Claus at Christmas to brighten up the lives of the care home residents, highlighted the reliability of the vaccine.He said: ldquoThis vaccine has been approved by an independent body here in the UK along with many other countries and has been well tested at every stage.ldquoI have received the vaccine here in Northern Ireland and I feel % confident taking it, having my family take it and encouraging others to take it.ldquoIt will protect our most vulnerable and help our NHS to cope when it is so close to being overwhelmed.

Ellen had a close friendship group of about nine or ten girls who all grew up together and went on holidays together, she said.ldquoWhile the grief hit us all in dferent ways over the years, I was helped dealing with it as I had a lot of friends who were all going through the same thing as we all understood what we were going through.ldquoWe are a tight group of friends and now when we all come together itrsquos not about feeling sad about Ellen, itrsquos about look backing and being happy for her being there.

Ellen, of course, was still going through grief from the loss of her mother. There are people who can get up and get on with things but there are people, such as some of my friends, who did not cope so well, so MYMY provides services for people who are not coping ldquoWhile raising money was not the objective, the real reason was to get people out and about and moving in January as the month is grim enough, but even more so with the tight lockdown.ldquoI wanted it to be something that everybody could take part in, old or young people and you can run one day or walk the next.Cllr Laura Devlin, chairwoman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, is just one of the local people taking part in the initiative.She said she was delighted to hear of Maireadrsquos challenge in memory of Ellen and her mother.ldquoEveryone locally knows the Finnegans and what a tragedy it was to lose two amazing people from our local community.ldquoThis challenge is great for a number of reasons.

Self on Western ShoreThe proposed retrospective exhibition of O’Neill marking the th anniversary of his birth, was due to open on November  in Dublin’s Farmleigh Gallery, having been postponed from its original date in May due to the pandemic. “It was to be the first time since his  Belfast retrospective,” David Britton’s letter continued, “that so many of Daniel O’Neill’s works were to be seen together and included a number of works from The Ulster Museum Collection, as well as from many private collections.”Undeterred by the exhibition’s demise, Karen was determined to mark O’Neill’s centenary year “so we pushed ahead independently” explained David, “and published this monograph on him.” It’s a lavishly illustrated book with over  reproductions of O’Neill’s work and black and white period-photographs of himself and his friends. \"Girl from The North by Daniel ONeill“This is very much an Ulster story,” David’s note continued “as unlike his artist friends Gerard Dillon and George Campbell, who left Northern Ireland, O’Neill lived in Belfast and County Down for  of his  years.”The book is the result of a decade of research and contains much new information on the artist, his le, and the art scene in Dublin and Belfast in the period from  to the early s. The O’Neill family “lived in a Victorian redbrick terrace at  Dimsdale Street, overshadowed by Mackie’s iron factory,” the book’s introduction begins.Daniel was born on January ,  and started painting at the early age of  years old. He loved reading art books from his local library.\"Front Cover of the Book“Following his education at St John’s school on Colinward street , O’Neill left school to become an apprentice electrician.”He and his art-loving friends were “drawn to the Belfast Reference Library to learn more about art.”The author quotes a reference to the head librarian, Mr Jenkinson, “who would, contrary to library rules, allow O’Neill and his fellow painters to borrow illustrated texts for the weekends.”The book recounts O’Neill’s first attempts to exhibit in Belfast during World War II with fellow artists and le-long friends, Gerard Dillon and George Campbell. Considered a mysterious and enigmatic figure during his letime, and “tall, graceful, and incredibly good looking”, new research material in the book shines light on O’Neill’s personal strugglesand his complex relationship with his dealer, Victor Waddington. As well as his solo exhibitions, Karen Reihill’s book explores O’Neill’s participation in mixed exhibitions of Irish art sponsored by Waddington and the new Irish Arts Council, which took place in Ireland, UK, Europe, North America and Canada. In addition to Dillon and Campbell, other artists included in O’Neill’s story are Colin Middleton, Arthur Campbell, Markey Robinson, Nano Reid, Nevill Johnson, Arthur Armstrong and James MacIntyre. Paintings exhibited in art institutions at home and abroad are reproduced in the book for the first time, complimented by archival photographs of O’Neill and his friends, showing the reader how O’Neill adapted to the ious political, social and economic changes in Ireland until his untimely death in . It’s a vivid and evocative portrayal of the somewhat forgotten artist’s le, work and fellow-artists by an accomplished author and art consultant who ran Bonham’s world-renowned, picture department in London in the late s.Karen is a vocal st century champion for the Ulster Painters who has also worked as a conservator at Ireland’s National Gallery before founding Dublin’s Frederick Gallery with husband and fellow art-lover David Britton in . The book ends with acclaimed author and Irish art critic Brian Fallon’s commendation of O’Neill as “one of the strongest and most original personalities in Irish art since the second world war…. a visual poet whose imagination has its own soft, haunting and very inidual radiance.”Daniel O’Neill Romanticism  Friendships, by Karen Reihill, is available to order from bookshops, or online at www.frederickgallerybookshop.

About  Hong Kong pro-democracy figures were arrested by police on Wednesday under a national security law In the largest ever single arrest, over  pro–democracy legislators and activists were arrested and charged for subversion under the draconian National Security Law which had been imposed in July  on Hong Kong by Beijing. These laws override Hong Kong laws and judicial independence effectively ending Hong Kong’s autonomy. Freedom of speech, human rights, and the right to political dissent were early casualties. Among those arrested were former legislators, such as Lam Cheuk-ting, Eddie Chu Hoi-dick, Claudia Mo, James To, Gwyneth Ho, Alvin Yeung and Leung Kwok-Hung. Other people arrested were Professor of Law, Benny Tai, and American human rights lawyer, John Clancey.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The alleged pretext for the arrest of all these champions for democracy was that they had dared to campaign and make preparations for securing the election of a majority of pro-democracy legislators on Hong Kong’s Legislative Council which had been due to be held in September . However, because such a prospect looked likely at the time, the elections were postponed for a year by the Hong Kong government.These arrests had been preceded in December  by the jailing of leaders of the democracy protest movement, Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam followed by the arrest of Hong Kong media tycoon, Jimmy Lai, who is the owner of the Hong Kong newspaper, Apple Daily, and approximately thirty others who were all charged with breaching the National Security Law and who are being detained without any real prospect of being released on bail.China’s objective in all its actions is that after having effectively stripped Hong Kong’s Legislative Council of any democratic legitimacy, it has now turned its attention to crippling and destroying the Democracy Protest movement.Because the international community has been largely distracted by the Covid  crisis, the controversial U. S. Presidential election and the EU-UK Brexit negotiations, there has been an insufficient and uncoordinated response to China’s unacceptable behaviour by the major powers. Another factor has been that some of these countries also prefer to give priority to their short-sighted trading interests with China over their commitment to universal human rights values in light of the plight of Hong Kong citizens, and indeed their own long-term economic interests. This has to change before it is too late.With the Brexit negotiations having concluded and the US Presidential election also close to reaching finality, the Irish Government is now in a unique position to help change things. The opportunity is presented by the fact that on January st we took up our seat on the UN Security Council. When we secured election to this prestigious post in June , the then Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, promised that “we will use our presence to advance the causes we have championed – peace and security, conflict resolution, reconciliation……” Membership of the Security Council includes countries such as the UK and China who were co-signatories to the Sino- British treaty which established the “one country two systems” in Hong Kong. It also includes the United States soon to be led by our Presidential “friend of Ireland”. Furthermore, under the UN Charter “Chapter  the role of the Security Council includes among other things:-The UN Security Council are authorised to investigate a dispute which may lead to an international friction, or is likely to endanger international peace and security.Should a dispute endanger international peace or security, the UN Security Council may recommend terms of settlement of the disputeNow is an opportune time to put our credentials to the test by persuading our fellow members of the UN Security Council to explore these two options.• John Cushnahan is a former Alliance Party leader, Fine Gael MEP and European Parliament Rapporteur on Hong Kong from  to ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The hope is that unionists will consent to anything even the Irish sea border in order to keep governing the Province and remain in the UK. They have absolutely no intention of ever ing to direct rule over Northern Ireland ever again — as proved conclusively during the three year collapse of the assembly. We have got to grin and bear this situation, because there is absolutely nothing that we can do as unionists to change the facts on the ground. Unionist leaders have been consistently out-manoeuvred by British governments and all the protests in the world have failed to change anything from the prorogation of Stormont in , the Anglo Irish Agreement and many other developments forwards.We should become as devious and subtle as republicans, because that is the only way to deal with successive British leaders who have absolutely no interest in or sympathy for our cause, and will always put the interests particularly of England first — note the NI protocol was the price of Brexit which was cheerfully paid, because there are no votes for any British party in Northern Ireland and they really have no ‘selfish or strategic’interest in this place .Frank McClintock, Belfast BT——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...\"Craigavon Civic CentreAt the time, DUP Alderman Stephen Moutray told officers they should be “embarrassed” by the contents of the report and a proposal from Councillor Mark Baxter, seconded by Alderman Ian Burns, saw officers redraw their plans.Revised plans were brought before the committee in December with two options, both with an allocated budget of £, put to members.DUP group leader Mark Baxter proposed that option one was supported by Council and this proposal was seconded by UUP Alderman Ian Burns.All DUP and UUP members of the committee voted in favour of the proposal with all SDLP and Sinn Fein councillors voting against .The committeeChair, Alliance Party councillor Brian Pope abstained from the vote. As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years. We are all volunteers at Penarth RNLI, we give our time freely to support our local community.ldquoMikersquos contribution to the charity over the years has not only been volunteering his time, hersquos also been happy to share his wealth of experience with the crew as we train and work together when someone needs our help.

These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi.

Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
