But then it quickly rallied, spiking to $1.2997 after Carney said in a press conference that a reduction in Brexit uncertainty would help the economy.Stride said: “This is a worrying story on the integrity of the Bank’s information security. When the new Treasury committee is formed, I’d expect us to see the outgoing Mark Carney and incoming Andrew Bailey pretty swiftly. I’ve no doubt that we’ll have some searching questions for them to answer in order to get to the bottom of this.”The security breach followed a restructuring of the Bank’s security ision that prompted a wave of senior departures, first revealed by the Observer. Rob Elsey, an executive director who serves as chief information officer, will become the latest top-ranking security official to leave since the restructuring. He will leave the Bank by June to take up a new role, the  can reveal.A Bank spokesman said Elsey’s departure was not linked to the security breach under investigation.Elsey reports to Joanna Place, the Bank’s chief operating officer with final responsibility for security, who has faced calls to resign because of the breach. The chief operating officer reports directly to the governor.Elsey said: “After a hugely enjoyable and successful five years at the Bank I have decided to take up an exciting new role that offers the opportunity to relocate. This move has been in the works for a number of months, and while it is never easy to leave, the opportunity is one I couldn’t say no to. I will be serving my full notice period, leaving the Bank on 1 June.”The security lapse has cast a shadow over the final months of Carney’s time as governor, and may cause problems for incoming governor Bailey, who takes over at Threadneedle Street on 16 March. Bailey has promised to recuse himself from all discussions on the breach to avoid a potential conflict of interest while his previous employer, the Financial Conduct Authority, investigates.David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank’s influential monetary policy committee, reiterated his call for Place to resign. “It looks like the buck doesn’t stop at the top,” he said. “This needs to be fully investigated by the Treasury select committee.” understands that the Bank commissioned internal and external assessments of the restructuring plans, some of which warned against the approach. Sam Woods, one of the Bank’s deputy governors, challenged the decision in November 2019 during a meeting of the executive risk committee. The Bank said this was a normal part of his duties as chair of the committee, and that he supported the decision.A Bank spokesman said: “In order to strengthen information security, the Bank overhauled its approach in 2019. The new design drew on third-party expertise and extensive consideration of different models in the private and public sector. The resulting structure clarified first-line accountability and consolidated it within the Bank’s technology directorate. It also placed second-line challenge in the new, independent risk directorate.“The restructure has the full support of the executive risk committee, chaired by Sam Woods, and the Bank’s audit and risk committee.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88285453ef932f9d397624f873572a7cef95d019/0_77_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49c1de3f63f7288ea007b3701eebe743","title":"us regulators deny church investors right to hold firms to account","story":"Exclusive: investors say SEC plans will make it harder to push for better governanceManagers of the Church of England’s £8.3bn investment portfolio have criticised US regulators for planning to deny smaller shareholders, such as the church, the right to challenge US companies over excessive executive pay and the climate crisis.A group of 70 church investors, including the C of E, have written to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opposing its plans to “modernise” shareholder rules by adding stricter criteria for filing resolutions voted on at a company’s annual meeting.The Church Investors Group (CIG), which manages a combined £21bn in assets, said the changes would make it harder for independent shareholders to push for better governance.Edward Mason, the head of responsible investment for the Church Commissioners, which is the C of E’s financial arm, told the : “We’re very concerned about the direction of regulation in the US that is restricting shareholders’ ability to hold companies to account. The mission of the SEC is to protect investors but these changes seem intended to protect companies from accountability to their investors.”The C of E said if the rules were changed it would be harder to challenge US companies on issues such as high executive pay, climate change and ersity. Some of its largest corporate holdings are in US companies including Google’s parent Alphabet, the tech firm Oracle and the agriculture equipment firm John Deere.The C of E has previously attacked large US firms such as Amazon for paying “almost nothing” in taxes and criticised ExxonMobil for failing to disclose emissions reduction targets.In the UK, the church has used its shareholding to criticise Sports Direct over poor working conditions and attack energy companies such as BP over their carbon footprints. It is pushing Barclays to phase out loans for fossil fuel companies.Under the US regime, shareholders file a resolution to the company, a copy of which is then forwarded to the SEC. If the shareholder meets the criteria, companies can either allow the resolution to go ahead, ask the shareholder to withdraw it or challenge it through the SEC. “Investors will lose their right to challenge boards,” the CIG letter said. While a number of shareholder resolutions may fail to gain overwhelming support, the CIG argues that proposals by independent investors have helped flag emerging issues to the company before they become a larger concern. “This would simply diminish investors’ ability to seek company disclosure of meaningful financial and other information,” the letter explained.The CIG’s members primarily hail from the UK and Ireland but also include international groups such as the Church of Norway and the Methodist church in New Zealand.The SEC declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/035a2d20ab1e782c7bf01e52805126f3c96a77dc/0_278_4652_2791/master/4652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b482c0f152d3d3f778ad5029da8864ae","title":"keir starmer past scrutiny","story":"I remember in July 2008 when the news broke of the decision to appoint Keir Starmer as director of public prosecutions (DPP). I was at a meeting of socialist lawyers, people who had spent their lives campaigning for the rights of homeless people and asylum seekers. We couldn’t understand why he’d taken the role.On standing for the Labour leadership, Keir Starmer published a video, setting out his record as a barrister who had represented poll tax protesters and striking miners. “I don’t think anyone,” a voiceover says, “really expected someone who dedicated his career to defending workers, trade unions and trade unions to become director of public prosecutions.” They were right about that.As a barrister, Starmer was a principled opponent of state power. He was one of us. But the DPP’s role is all about exercising power: prosecuting defendants so that they are fined or jailed. Starmer’s time as DPP has played a role in the Labour leadership contest, particularly in blogs and on social media – and will be studied even more closely if he wins. What should we make of it?As DPP, Starmer was the head of the Crown Prosecution Service. This is the body that decides whether or not to prosecute someone accused of a crime. Where the decision is taken to prosecute, it is the CPS that employs a lawyer to argue in court for a conviction. The CPS is a huge organisation, undertaking more than half a million prosecutions a year, and employing almost 6,000 people.There were a number of decisions that Starmer got right. He was appointed by Labour but spent half his time in office under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition. There, he defended the Human Rights Act against Conservative proposals to repeal it. Rightwing MPs briefed against him. Starmer deserves recognition for taking that stand.There is a second group of decisions taken by the CPS for which Starmer has been criticised, but it is difficult to say whether the criticisms are justified. The “most difficult” decision was, according to Starmer, in relation to the killing of Ian Tomlinson, the newspaper vendor who was struck by police officer Simon Harwood during protests in 2009.Although between 30 and 50 people die each year in police custody or following contact with the police, these deaths almost never lead to prosecution. In that context, the left demanded Harwood’s prosecution.Starmer told the press that the CPS wouldn’t prosecute. He cited the report of Dr Freddy Patel, the pathologist appointed by the state, who found the death had been caused by natural causes. Although other pathologists disagreed with Patel, the CPS insisted that the fact of his opinion was an insuperable barrier to prosecution. In October 2010, Dr Patel was suspended from practice as a result of allegations concerning the way he undertook autopsies. The CPS again announced that Harwood would not be prosecuted. Only in May 2011, after an inquest jury had found that Tomlinson had been unlawfully killed, did the CPS agree to charge Harwood with manslaughter.The difficulty in criticising Starmer for his handling of this case – or others like it – is that we don’t know what advice he was given. If senior prosecutors were advising him against proceeding, he can’t be faulted for caution. After all, what would be the point of prosecution, if it was highly likely that the officer was going to be acquitted? Which, in 2012, Harwood was.Where Starmer’s record may be more vulnerable to criticism is in his handling of the press. One of the DPP’s tasks is to issue guidance to prosecutors. The guidance reminds prosecutors of the powers already available to them. Usually, the guidance is not controversial. For example, in November last year, the CPS offered guidance on prosecuting offences under the Theft Act. As far as I can tell, no paper reported on that guidance its publication was seen as the routine act of a government department.His critics are able to exaggerate his role because of interviews given by Starmer himself in which he presented modest changes to the advice given to prosecutors as matters of real significance and used a tabloid-friendly language to defend them. This was how he justified the guidance on protests: “There’s a potential for a number of protests over the coming years that may be quite large … If someone has brought along a weapon or means of concealing their identity that’s likely to be evidence that they were anticipating trouble or disorder.”In fact, over the past two decades, it has become more common for demonstrators to cover their faces. They do so because of the increasing use of snatch squads, police filming of political protests and scandals such as detention without arrest. When Starmer called for the vigorous pursuit of protesters who have concealed their identity, he was playing up to press fantasies about their motives.This, meanwhile, is how Starmer explained his guidance to prosecutors in benefits cases: “It is a myth that ‘getting one over on the system’ is a victimless crime: the truth is we all pay the price” and “It is vital that we take a tough stance on this type of fraud and I am determined to see a clampdown on those who flout the system.”The largest group of benefits prosecutions concern the minor infractions of people who fail to declare a piece of information. For example, when part-time workers on housing benefit fail to tell the authorities that their hours at work have increased. Starmer’s words (“getting one over on the system”) were wide enough so that it seemed he was referring to such groups of claimants. And, in doing so, he evoked tabloid myths about undeserving iniduals deliberately and systematically milking the system. To speak of claimants in this way was to denigrate them.Looking back on Starmer’s management of the media while DPP, the sense is of an inidual with a radical past making peace with power. He was at ease there in a way that Jeremy Corbyn, among others, could never have been.His supporters will say that Labour needs a leader capable of winning press support. To which his critics will counter that the rightwing press is already ungenerously studying Starmer’s career. It is a mistake to think that his close proximity to high-profile cases will be anything other than a recurring weak point in relation to the tabloids.Starmer’s enthusiasm while DPP for using mundane news events to feed the press with rightwing talking points is a possible concern for Labour members. If such a leader was faced with news of an injustice in the future – the consequence of a change to immigration rules, say, or of a strike in public services – Starmer’s approach to the press as DPP might raise worries that he would not give a principled defence of the victims but would tell the press whatever it wanted to hear.• David Renton is a political activist and barrister.

John Maynard Keynes’ The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money did not invent monetary analysis. But it changed the way that money, finance, demand and unemployment in a modern economy were understood. Such is its enduring power that, three years ago, it was voted the most significant British academic book of the modern age. Keynes knew what he was on to when he wrote The General Theory. In a letter to the playwright and activist George Bernard Shaw, he wrote: “I believe myself to be writing a book on economic theory, which will largely revolutionise … the way the world thinks about economic problems.”What is interesting from a historical perspective is how such a dominant ideology can be toppled. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of events sent shockwaves around western democracies – student revolts, Vietnam, oil shocks, stagflation and the end of the Keynes-inspired Bretton Woods system. Conservatives mobilised an argument that generous welfare spending did not just undermine capitalism, but had inflationary, destabilising consequences and hence was a threat to democratic governance. By 1975, it became an influential report titled The Crisis of Democracy. In 1976 it was a British Labour prime minister, James Callaghan, who pronounced Keynesianism dead.Monetarism, the economic theory that took over, has failed. Growth in UK GDP per head since 2008 has been almost zero. The economist James Crotty writes in his book Keynes Against Capitalism that this flatlining takes place when “social democracy is in retreat, authoritarian oligarchies are on the rise” in a global system that punishes any country that does not play by the “rules of the game”. Many authoritarians are now using state power to lock in the dominance of the rich. That is what Iain Duncan Smith meant when he told the BBC “you need a dose of Keynesianism to restore monetarism”. Austerity meant the economy was starved of demand when inflation was low. The answer is for governments to spend. But Mr Duncan Smith was not talking about the state intervening on the side of labour, redistributing wealth or socialising investment. Instead, the right now proposes a Keynesianism without Keynes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4b00e49be059567230569addc0c74f1ee38781/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2fd31dbb638e9c69d5e7fdc6ac9dfb09 1370w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of clash","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘clash’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘clash’.Share your photos of what clash means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 19 February at 10am.

The town water supply — never drinkable, but usable for laundry, toilets and watering plants — was turned off.For months there was no water coming from the taps. The rainwater tank, once used just for drinking water but now the only supply, was running low.The family lives in a rundown rented property. Even if it does rain, “we end up with more water in the living room than we do in the tank”, Laurance says.The only option was to pay $450 for a water truck to drop 15,000 litres into the rainwater tank each month.Although parts of New South Wales received a deluge of rain in early February, it did not break the drought. About 70 towns in the state are still facing the prospect of serious water security problems within 12 months, including running out entirely, unless there is significant rainfall. Water carting, bores, pipelines and desalination plants are planned for multiple towns. As many as 15 towns have been forced to cart in water.Euchareena sits in the Macquarie Valley. Just 30 minutes’ drive away is the rest of the region’s main water supply at Burrendong Dam, a vast inland store that can hold as much as three Sydney Harbours’ worth of water, serving about 70,000 people.This map shows evapotranspiration (water lost from the environment and plants) for the period 1986-2005 compared with that projected for 2080-99.

Increased evapotranspiration can exacerbate drought conditions as it means less soil moistureWater NSW says that without major rain, what’s left in the dam is enough to meet “critical human needs” until just the middle of 2020 for towns that include Dubbo, Warren, Nyngan, Cobar and Wellington.Fleur and Locky have a small business running cultural workshops and ceremonies.At the suggestion of a local pharmacist they travelled to Wellington with a mob of kids to perform a raindance. They asked the rain spirit Wahwee to bring rain for the people and the land.The Macquarie Valley sits in the north of the Murray-Darling basin, where the drought has been fierce. Rainfall totals have been the lowest on record here.“This is a very extreme drought,” says Dr Ben Henley, a climate scientist researching water resources at Monash University. “But actually, so far it’s quite short.”He says climate models are so far inconclusive about whether the Macquarie Valley region will get wetter or drier. For the southern parts of Australia, the models are more conclusive. There will be less rain.But the models and the weather observations are clear, Henley says, that climate change is pushing temperatures ever higher.When you live in a tin house with not enough cash for air conditioners, you have to find different ways to cool down. Like running down to the dam, which is no longer safe to swim in.Fleur contacted local media about her town’s water problem and, along with Euchareena\u0027s progress association, started writing to the local council about their plight. In October 2019, Dubbo council applied for state government funding to pay for water to be carted by truck to residents.Now a truck rolls up every 21 days and drops 13,000 litres into the family’s water tank — an allowance of 100 litres a person each day, which cannot be used outside the home. Fleur and Locky run a household with no alcohol, no drugs and no gambling, and they play a critical role in mentoring young Aboriginal people.“We are cultural knowledge holders and we have a responsibility to pass that on,” Fleur says.This means there will often be a lot more than just six people in the house, and it’s the reason why, every 18 days or so, there’s no water left in their tank.

But on Sunday morning at London fashion week, Victoria Beckham broke with the mid-calf length that has become ubiquitous in fashion with a radical trend: the knee-length skirt.A knee-length skirt worn with a blouse and sweater may not sound like a revolutionary look. But Beckham’s influence – as a designer and a much-photographed celebrity – having been key in making longer skirts into a mainstream trend, her volte-face may signal the beginning of a wider trend.“I broke my own rules today,” said Beckham backstage after her show. “I’ve been wanting to do something shorter for a while – I know that I still want to wear a shorter length sometimes. So I’ve been trying to figure out how do I do that in a cool way. And I’m a minimalist, so I’m always looking for ways to make clothes that are exciting but still wearable. I want to challenge myself, not challenge the customer. Clothes shouldn’t make life difficult.”What Beckham called the “gently rebellious” mood of her show extended to the Little Simz soundtrack. With her family attending, Beckham said she had warned her eight-year-old daughter, Harper, that “there might be rude words that you wouldn’t normally hear”.Tailored culottes, or vented tweed skirts, finished just above the knee. Pie-frill collar blouses, velvet blazers and chain belts added to the bourgeois-chic effect, while tight thigh-high boots “make the look sexy and tough at the same time”. For evening, a midnight blue fluid silk dress to mid-thigh with high, draped neckline and full sleeves represented “my version of a modern party dress,” Beckham said. “I haven’t been a typical ‘party dress’ person for a long time, actually. If I go out at night I am more likely to wear some kind of tuxedo. But I want to wear this. I like how the volume on the sleeve offsets the shorter length.”Richard Avedon’s dynamic 1960s portraits of a leaping Penelope Tree were on Beckham’s mood board this season – “something about the spirit and the freedom, more than the clothes” – along with images of Marisa Berenson, who “used to wear the same clothes for day and evening, but put more makeup on at night,” said Beckham. “I think that’s quite cool.”The all-American fashion powerhouse Tommy Hilfiger is making a guest appearance at this London fashion week with a show co-designed with Lewis Hamilton and the Grammy-award winning R\u0026ampB singer HER.But Hilfiger “doesn’t believe in traditional fashion shows”, he says. “What I believe in are unforgettable experiences, where you show clothes. It has to be truly memorable, otherwise it’s just not relevant.”Hilfiger lays claim to be the godfather of streetwear. “We created streetwear in the late 1980s before streetwear existed,” he said at a preview before his Tate Modern show. “We started out as a preppy brand, and then we added sport. Not sportswear as it had been seen in fashion before, but the clothes real athletes wore to play basketball, football, hockey – oversized clothes, bright colours, big type and numbers. The fashion writers at the time called it hip-hop wear, but we said no, hip-hop kids are wearing our look, which is called streetwear.”Hilfiger pointed to a tracksuit in setting-plaster pink with tonal embossed logo as a look showing Lewis Hamilton’s influence. “It’s elegant, luxe street style – that whole Kanye-in-California vibe,” Hilfiger said.HER brought her “unisex, utility, oversized” style to boilersuits with neon ring pulls on the zips. The three-way collaboration is the latest in a series 68-year-old Hilfiger has done with young fashion influencers including Zendaya and Gigi Hadid. “I was afraid to grow up, I guess,” he explained."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cea6d012422bd0fe5c1c80c20d6aa5f676a8b4cf/0_1674_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d081e7d0f344d75297f915d8f207fc3","title":"spring clean the key looks from the new collections in pictures","story":"Power shoulders, pastels, frills and black tie dressing, we take some of the trends from the SS20 season for a spin• Read more from the springsummer 2020 edition of The Fashion, our biannual style supplement"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f9b45ba6bd588ea2eac64e2a335daae8a84a0fb/0_115_5114_3068/master/5114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c405e6b64f250f55d0a01d83b069f8f1","title":"harvey weinstein trial jury deliberations","story":"The #MeToo movement received barely a mention at the movie mogul’s rape trial but is likely to bear heavily on deliberationsThe jury at Harvey Weinstein’s rape trial in New York will begin deliberations on Tuesday, with the world’s media and the expectations of the #MeToo movement bearing heavily upon them.The five women and seven men who form the jury hold in their hands the fate of the disgraced movie mogul. If they find him guilty of two of the five counts against him, of “predatory sexual assault”, he could be sentenced to life in prison.Since the trial began last month, the jurors have constantly been reminded of intense media interest in the case.Prosecutors and Weinstein’s lawyers have frequently directed jurors’ vision to the overflowing press benches in courtroom No 99 at the New York supreme court, and alluded to the sound of keyboards rattling as one way of highlighting the high-profile nature of the case.The process of reaching a verdict will not be easy or brief. The first trial of Bill Cosby, the comedian whose prosecution is often compared to that of Weinstein, ended in a mistrial when the jury failed to agree after six gruelling days of deliberations.Cosby was found guilty at a second trial and sentenced in 2018 to three to 10 years in prison.There are two main accusers in the Weinstein case.Miriam Haley was working as a production assistant in 2006 when she alleges Weinstein lured her to his SoHo apartment in New York and forced oral sex on her.A woman who the  is not identifying, as she has not indicated that she wishes to be publicly named, alleges she was raped in a New York hotel in 2013.Weinstein, 67, has also been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 100 women. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.In the New York trial, four women who accuse the producer of rape and sexual assault – Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra, Dawn Dunning, Tarale Wulff and Lauren Young – were called by the prosecution to give supporting evidence.In closing arguments, Weinstein’s lead defence lawyer, Donna Rotunno, and lead prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon presented the jury with starkly contrasting summaries of the case.Though #MeToo, the social reckoning galvanised by the accusations of sexual abuse levelled against the Pulp Fiction producer since 2017, has rarely been mentioned in court, it has clearly influenced the lawyers’ diametrically opposing interpretations of the case in hand.Rotunno has portrayed the six women as money-grabbing, manipulative iniduals who exploited Weinstein in order to advance their careers. According to that view, they were prepared to do anything – including consensual sex – in order to get on.On Friday, Illuzzi-Orbon gave a very different analysis. Weinstein, she said, treated women who he tricked into entering his lair like “ants he could step on without consequences”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/291ca14579ad73214ca579cc13936273e1bcd695/0_0_2732_1639/master/2732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df3ae6acd13401bfc9cfa59dfd1af9de","title":"parasite film oscars bong joon ho seoul rich poor south korea","story":"Few would begrudge South Koreans their moment of joy after Parasite’s historic success at the Oscars. Not only was Bong Joon-ho’s film the first non-English language production in the Academy Awards’ 92-year history to win best picture – one of four Oscars on the night for the director and his crew – it was long-overdue recognition by the global movie industry of the brilliance of South Korean cinema.But the celebrations, led by the country’s president, Moon Jae-in, concealed an uncomfortable truth about Bong’s masterpiece. Centring on the tension between the Kims, a basement-dwelling family of “dirt spoons” in Seoul, and the Parks, a family at the opposite end of the social spectrum, Parasite’s plot is predicated on the widening gap between the haves and the have nots in Asia’s fourth-biggest economy.Moon, a liberal who came to power in 2017 promising to create jobs, redistribute wealth and weaken the power of the chaebol – the family-run firms that drove postwar development – praised Parasite as a “uniquely Korean story”.The film exposes the paradox at the heart of a country better known around the world for its technological prowess and pop music.While scenes from the Parks’ spacious designer home and the Kims’ slum basement flat were shot on purpose-built sets, it draws its realism from those set in deprived neighbourhoods a world away from the exclusive Gangnam neighbourhood in the city’s south.They include Ahyeon-dong near central Seoul – a district of crumbling brick buildings where rents for half-basement flats have doubled in the past decade – and narrow streets perched on a hillside dotted with steep concrete staircases, all in sight of gleaming high-rise apartments for the rich. By contrast, the scenes around the Parks’ sprawling home were filmed in Seongbuk-dong, where the streets are immaculately clean and homeowners go about their lives behind high walls and spiked security fences.While living standards in South Korea are on a par with those in the UK, young people in particular are worried about an increasingly uncertain economic future in which surviving the cut-throat education system no longer guarantees them a well-paid job for life. And they have little to look forward to in retirement, with figures showing that a large proportion of older South Koreans are living in poverty.Bong’s stinging – and at times hilarious – commentary on the friction generated by poverty’s proximity to wealth could bring financial benefits to some of Ahyeon-dong’s residents, however, via guided tours planned by the city government.One of the tours takes in five locations around Seoul that have resonated with Parasite audiences, including the Pig Rice supermarket where Ki-woo, the Kims’ 20-something son, drinks soju spirit with a friend, a concrete stairway in a nearby alleyway that leads to the Kim family’s semi-basement flat, the Jahamun road tunnel, and the Sky Pizza parlour that employs the family to fold boxes for a pittance.Last week, stray dogs and cats roamed the streets, while young women took selfies, and photographers and TV crews filmed the shop.“My husband and I thought it was such an honour for our shop to appear in Parasite,” its 72-year-old owner, Kim Kyung-soon, says. “Then we saw the news about the Oscars. The film kept winning and winning. We stayed up celebrating all night, along with everyone else in South Korea.”But not everyone is happy, with one resident concerned that interest in its dilapidated architecture would put a halt to rumoured redevelopment plans. “If the Parasite tours take off, there will be pressure to preserve these buildings and that will mean the end of the redevelopment plan,” he says. “That would be a disaster. We’ve been waiting for it for years. The ceiling in my place is leaking water and we are biding our time until the day we can move out. We don’t want our neighbourhood to stay like this because of a movie.”But Um Hang-gi, the owner of Sky Pizza, where sales have soared since the Oscars, is savouring the attention. “Just think of all the upstarts in our society who get rich quick through deceit and scheming,” says Um, who has placed a poster in the window lauding her business’s minor role in Bong’s success. “They don’t care who gets hurt.”Despite having seen the film three times, Lee Seung-jin, a 28-year-old designer who lives nearby, says he is offended by the idea of “poverty tourism”. “Parasite is a parody about the gap between the rich and the poor, so for city officials to come up with the idea for these tours is ridiculous. Shouldn’t they be working to narrow the wealth gap instead of parading poor people around for tourists to gawp at?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b79741bdd37c3c9f3b391f20d37e9abd11032774/679_475_3907_2344/master/3907.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfc2407b41bf195e84b345ef648ce677","title":"50 things we love in the world of food right now","story":"For those taking a step into Thai food beyond green curry, the first stop is often the fiercely flavoured food of the north – including larb (or laap), a dish of minced meat with regional variations, but which often includes the spice makhwaen.

You might call it, for want of a better word, satisfaction. Not happiness, as such: Arsenal don’t really do happiness. But the soft and sleepy contentment of a game well won, an afternoon without qualms or catastrophic injuries or late drama or existential angst: this was the unfamiliar part.You could legitimately point out that things have gotten pretty rough for Arsenal fans when the yardstick of a successful afternoon is one not spent screaming. But as ever in these faltering early days of the Mikel Arteta era, you have to take your little triumphs where you can find them.This was certainly one: a victory secured with class and brass, gilded by two late strikes from Mesut Özil and Alexandre Lacazette that elevated this from functional win to rout. A victory with caveats too, to be sure: how Bernd Leno managed to emerge with a clean sheet is a question that will flummox the statisticians of the future. Indeed, for all their dominance Arsenal occasionally did their level best to make Newcastle look like a functional attacking side. Had Steve Bruce’s team been a little more clinical, particularly in the first 20 minutes when terms were still being negotiated, it might have been a different game entirely. By the time they threatened again, around an hour in, Arsenal were already 2-0 up through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Nicolas Pépé, and largely safe.Pépé was a treat to watch. It was his precise cross that set up Aubameyang’s opening goal, and his own strike three minutes later was fitting reward for a pleasingly decisive performance: sharp, unpredictable, productive. There are plenty of Arsenal fans who had already written him off after a disappointing half-season: in and out of the side, weighed down by his £72m price tag and the pressure of adapting to a new league and a dysfunctional team. But there’s a proper player in there, and Arteta seems to recognise as much.“We just need consistency from him,” Arteta said. “The way he applied himself defensively as well, he was doing things he didn’t do in the past. He made the difference today.”As for Newcastle, there will be a few eyebrows raised at their late collapse, one in which their hard-won reputation for shape and solidity seemed to evaporate before our eyes. After a strong first half, they looked paralysed by caution in the second: consumed not by what they could get but by what they could get away with. The new wing-backs Valentino Lazaro and Danny Rose began well but looked dangerously exposed as the game went on. Bruce has staked his job and Newcastle’s survival on their ability to make things tough for the opposition. This, a meek and tired capitulation after a break of 12 days, did not bode well.And yet it was Newcastle who began this game by far the stronger: parrying Arsenal’s thrusts with ease, passing through the press, making the most of their infrequent spells of possession. With Miguel Almirón barracking his way up the right wing and Allan Saint-Maximin weaving his sorcery on the left, the early chances fell to the visitors. Lazaro had a shot blocked in the fifth minute. Sean Longstaff’s volley following an immaculately worked set-piece was almost deflected past a scrambling Leno. Joelinton stabbed just wide from six yards.But Arsenal finished the first half well, portending their clinical three‑minute burst near the start of the second. Eddie Nketiah, unexpectedly given the job of leading the line, began to find little pockets of space. On 53 minutes, Newcastle allowed Pépé plenty of time to pick a cross. Aubameyang placed his header well, sending it back across Martin Dubravka.Suitably relaxed, Arsenal loosened their ties and played a few shots. Pépé struck next, finishing from close range after an outrageous bit of skill from Bukayo Saka on the left. And though Newcastle briefly threatened to make the game interesting – Ciaran Clark missing from unmissable range, Saint-Maximin clattering the post – it was Arsenal who provided the final flourish. In the 90th minute, Lacazette squared for Özil. Perhaps through force of habit, Özil’s shot was more of a pass, a delicate lay-off that Dubravka could have trapped with his foot. Instead it bobbled out of his grasp and into the net.Lacazette brought the curtain down, smashing home Pépé’s cross after a lovely through ball from Joe Willock. Four-nil, and if there was any lingering surprise at full-time, it was not merely that Arsenal could still win at all, but that they could win like this. This was, if you can believe it, their first home win against a team ranked lower than them since October. And so it may only have been three points. But in the final reckoning, this may well be the game when Arsenal started to feel like a big club again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f323b785836616ee9f0b22dbd46516168d966b48/0_174_3816_2289/master/3816.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ef1d00b37e5f216e3e4e17b7201df85","title":"bbc pundits derby young black lads sparks call for action craig ramage max lowe kick it out","story":"The BBC has said it will no longer use the pundit Craig Ramage after the former midfielder criticised Derby County’s “young black lads”, saying they needed “bringing down a peg or two”.The 49-year-old made the comments, which Kick It Out condemned as “thoughtless racist stereotypes”, on BBC Radio Derby’s Sportscene show after Saturday’s 1-1 draw with Huddersfield Town.The BBC said: “These were entirely unacceptable comments and we will no longer be working with Craig.”Ramage, who was employed by the BBC on a freelance basis, said on social media that he apologised unreservedly: “What I said was wholly inappropriate and unintentional. Race is irrelevant to the issues that I was discussing and I deeply regret what I said. I sincerely hope that the players accept my apology.”Kick It Out had called on the BBC to take “effective action” after Ramage, a former Derby and Watford midfielder, said on the programme, which has since been edited and re-uploaded online: “When I look at certain players, their body language, their stance, the way they act, you just feel, hold on a minute, he needs pulling down a peg or two.“So I’d probably say that about all the young black lads, all the young advice if they wanted it, that, you know, it’s about, when you are struggling for form, you are going through a sticky patch, it’s about going back to basics, working hard, and doing the right things.”On Sunday the 22-year-old Derby defender Max Lowe flagged up Ramage’s comments on social media, saying he “decided to speak out on behalf of all black footballers at Derby County”. Lowe added on Instagram: “Racial ignorance, stereotyping and intolerance negatively affects the image of impressionable young footballers and creates an unnecessary ide in society. I am also disappointed that a public service broadcaster did not step in to ask the analyst to explain his reasoning or to distance themselves from these archaic thoughts.”The Kick It Out chairman, Sanjay Bhandari, said: “These comments are shocking and the views expressed are the kind of thoughtless racist stereotypes that we heard 50 years ago. We do not expect to hear them lazily trotted out in 2020. I expect effective action to be taken by the BBC. I support Max Lowe’s comments and we offer our support to Max, Jayden Bogle and the young Derby players.”Derby released a statement in which they said they had been in contact with the BBC, underlining that the club “take comments like these extremely seriously, we do not tolerate them, and stand shoulder to shoulder, together as one with all our players”. The club’s specialist first-team coach, Liam Rosenior, a member of manager Phillip Cocu’s backroom staff, said the comments were “unacceptable”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71439dd4131fbf3eeacc671640a5c7bf5d28292c/0_131_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a5526968a5bcda53a87c66d359b3ba3","title":"everton to drop lucrative deal with gambling giant two years early","story":"Everton are to end their sponsorship by the Kenyan gambling giant SportPesa at the end of this season, two years early, the club has announced.The lucrative five-year deal with SportPesa, agreed in 2017, was one of the most high-profile and increasingly controversial of Premier League club sponsorships by gambling companies, which has prompted campaigners to warn of the social costs and “dire consequences” being caused by the increasing “gamblification” of football.The early termination of the deal, which was understood to be for £7m a season, an Everton record, follows a strategic review of the club’s commercial operations led by the chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale.She responded to a question at the club’s AGM last month by saying that “in an ideal world” they would prefer a “different type of sponsor” than a gambling company. Everton’s desire to increase their activities and revenues with sponsors, in line with the club’s development and investment under the ownership of Farhad Moshiri, together with restrictions which apply when a sponsor is a gambling company, are understood to have been factors in the club approaching SportPesa to end the sponsorship early.An Everton spokesperson said: “This has been a difficult decision but one that allows us to best deliver on our commercial plan and to grasp the new opportunities now open to us.“The club would like to thank SportPesa for all of the work that has been done together. Our partnership has seen our first team visit Africa on two occasions, as well as former players and club staff take part in numerous activations in the region. This has allowed us to grow our own footprint in Africa and further strengthen our special relationship with the continent.” SportPesa, founded by a partnership of Bulgarian casino operators and wealthy, influential Kenyans in Nairobi six years ago, grew rapidly by promoting online gambling in the country. Last summer the Kenyan government expressed concerns about young people becoming addicted to betting and falling into debt, and toughened its regulatory approach to the companies, suspending many licences, including that of SportPesa.The company had expanded quickly into the UK and Europe, agreeing partnerships with Arsenal, Southampton and Hull City, before it become the main sponsor at Everton. The company set up an office in Liverpool’s Liver building, where Everton’s offices are also now based, and were marketed as a partner which had “a strong alignment” with Everton’s values, including by being involved in Everton’s community programme.At their last home game, against Crystal Palace, Everton used it as the annual match clubs can use to promote a good cause by wearing on their shirts the name of their own community programme rather than SportPesa. Although the club has not committed to ending gambling sponsorships, given Barrett-Baxendale’s remarks at the AGM it must be considered unlikely that the main sponsor from next season will be a betting company."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0a4cf2d70b05038aa550b21892cd07d16f1d7da/0_98_2950_1769/master/2950.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1137f0d036208218561cbc1fdd57983","title":"manchester city ban was worth it to see sergio aguero and raheem sterling","story":"City fan Will Unwin remembers life in League One in the pre-Sheikh Mansour era and knows what he prefersDescribing something as “typical City” is a reference to the club shooting itself in the foot. Previously, it was brought up when discussing Jamie Pollock beating two men before heading the ball over his own goalkeeper to almost certainly doom the club to relegation to the third tier. Twenty-two years on it now seems to be a euphemism for financial doping.The situation the club now finds itself in was an inevitability. Financial Fair Play was announced in 2009 and 11 years later it should not come as a surprise that someone would be found guilty of abusing it. City have done nothing illegal but few at the club seem to remember that they agreed to abide by Uefa’s rules and have been found to have broken them, which means they deserve to be punished. There is little to debate on that front.Whether you agree with the rules is another question but the simple one for City fans at the moment is: has it all been worth it? Manchester City travel to Real Madrid in the knockout stages of the Champions League next week. When the two last met in the competition it was for a place in the final, which ended with the Spaniards progressing thanks to a single deflected goal over two legs. I left the Etihad Stadium after the goalless first leg disappointed, but by the time I was home I was laughing it off and reminiscing about away days at Grimsby and Port Vale, a sign of the surreal perspective change.The away end at the Santiago Bernabéu will include many who were at Blundell Park and Vale Park, too. The Fondo Norte will be full of vitriol towards Uefa but also plenty of gallows humour but that is what City fans do best. Tens of thousands have witnessed the revolution which has taken place at Manchester City under Sheikh Mansour, a level of change which left us bewildered, taking the club from Darius Vassell to Sergio Agüero in the blink of an eye.The City of Manchester Stadium, as the landlords christened it, was used to relegation battles and pointless Joey Barton corners before the investment arrived. In more recent times Kevin De Bruyne’s through balls and David Silva’s own brand of magic have been the order of the day. Meanwhile, Pep Guardiola has redefined the football in England thanks to his side’s all-action style, the most dramatic Premier League title finish ever was settled in injury-time by the club’s record goalscorer and, most importantly, Manchester United were put in their place with consistent thrashings.When Agüero thrashed home the 93rd minute winner against QPR, the feeling of euphoria within the Etihad was priceless and no punishment can ever take that memory away from those who were there. Yaya Touré settling an FA Cup semi-final against United will not fade into the background either, with many ranking it above beating Stoke in the final to lift the club’s first meaningful silverware in 37 years, a feat unthinkable without the Sheikh’s money.My morals have been loosened by chasing success across the continent from Dortmund to Barcelona. I have seen City fall short in the Champions League, having never even dreamed such fixtures would be possible growing up suffocating amid United’s consistent success. All football fans are extremely loyal to the club but City have helped themselves with a slick public relations operation to whip up the fans, with social media a hotbed of ire.The supporters’ and the club’s relationship with Uefa and Champions League has been toxic for years. The club’s fans perform a live remix of the Champions League anthem at every game, adding a layer of boos, something which undoubtedly does not impress Uefa.From the invention of FFP to CSKA Moscow’s stadium ban for racism being very loosely enforced, City fans have felt victimised by Uefa.Fines for racism are paltry on all occasions and Uefa’s own president was forced out for his inappropriate dealings. City’s main crime, which has resulted in the punishment, is the deception of Uefa itself, something they required a hacker to prove, the only illegal activity to take place in this whole affair. There will be an appeal and City will fight the claims to the bitter end, adding to the Abu Dhabi rollercoaster, one the fans will ride to the bitter end.The fans will be the forgotten victims within the scandal. City supporters are generally only remembered when they leave empty seats. The bond between a fan and club is hard to break and being guilty of deceiving an organisation you have little time for will not change the passion and feeling for City supporters who have witnessed success beyond their imagination.If the punishment is upheld, players will almost certainly need to be sold in the summer and the club’s ambitions will immediately suffer a 10-year setback.City fans are happy to reminisce about Colin Bell and Georgi Kinkladze, so should not worry too much about speaking about De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling in the past tense.Not being in the Champions League for a couple of years, a potential points deduction and selling star players sound bad but Aleksander Ceferin and co have never witnessed losing at York or Craig Russell playing at left-back, so not seeing Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo rock up at the Etihad for a while is a small price to pay for the joy we have had."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4ee8492550d4fafab1eb6522c0cc385b019ea61/0_59_3053_1832/master/3053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=717c6ec48d17b9b44cd83487c4b6d1f4","title":"powerplay how chancellor lost control of no 11","story":"For a decade Whitehall has been left in little doubt of the special adviser’s powerAs Tory MPs gathered in parliament on Wednesday evening, just hours before a reshuffle that most believed would be intriguing rather than explosive, they gave a warm welcome to the opening speaker.

For those in the room with doubts about Javid’s future, his cameo reassured them that he would survive the imminent ministerial cull.Despite the smile, however, Javid himself had become less confident in his position in the days leading up to Thursday’s reshuffle. He confided in friends that he feared his special advisers were being targeted by Downing St. A week of damaging media briefings about the forthcoming budget and relations between the Treasury and No 10 had raised fresh doubts. Those doubts were well founded: by late morning, he had gone.Last night, Javid’s allies remained furious about Boris Johnson’s demand that Javid sack his advisers as part of a plan to combine the No 10 and No 11 team of special advisers, or “spads” – an inflammatory order that Javid felt compelled to refuse. However, they were clear on what was behind the surprise demand, which was presented as an afterthought by the prime minister at the end of a long and otherwise good-natured meeting with his now former chancellor.“The hierarchy of the move would be: 1, power and process, 2, policy and 3, personality,” said one Javid ally. “It was predominantly about a frustration about the sheer power of the Treasury. It’s very difficult to do something about that, short of massive Whitehall reorganisation. The one lever they had was the spad universe. It was a change of institutional power via the backdoor. It wasn’t so much a joint team as a No 10 team.”Both Javid’s friends and senior figures across Whitehall are now trying to decipher a bigger question posed by the No 10 power grab, which dominated the reshuffle: would it come to be seen as the high watermark of the influence of Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave mastermind and senior adviser to Johnson? Or was it just an early skirmish in a much more ambitious attempt to sideline officials and departments, and centralise power inside Downing St?As the reshuffle unfolded last week, Tory MPs were initially baffled by the survival of some figures. One minster was surprised and concerned to see their own secretary of state return, having concluded they would be fired – and believing their dismissal to be the right move.However, taken as a whole, Tories saw that the reshuffle clearly reflected the wider Cummings agenda. John Whittingdale, a critic of the BBC, made a surprise return as culture minister. Chris Skidmore, the respected universities and science minister, was sacked – with the science brief taken out of the job description. It is a move that could give Cummings more space to push for his pet project – the creation of a British Advanced Research Projects Agency, which he believes could create ideas and projects with “world-changing potential”. Julian Smith, who had raised concerns about a no-deal Brexit on relations in Northern Ireland, was fired.One Tory described Suella Braverman’s appointment as attorney general as a “blatant political appointment”. Braverman, like Cummings, is highly critical of what they believe is the politicisation of the judiciary, particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling that Johnson’s attempt to prorogue parliament last year was unlawful. Meanwhile, Nus Ghani, a popular transport minister, was also sacked. She had been an enthusiastic supporter of Jeremy Hunt’s leadership campaign. “They want someone who will do what they’re told,” said a minister. “They’ve looked at difficult areas where they will need someone who is compliant.”For all the attempts to compare the Cummings power grab with Alastair Campbell’s dominance at the peak of New Labour, Whitehall veterans say the more telling comparison is with Ted Heath, who handed huge power to his official, William Armstrong, at the expense of the Treasury and his chancellor, Anthony Barber. Armstrong eventually had a breakdown, in the wake of the dispute with miners over the imposition of a three-day week.The frustration for Javid’s team was that while there had been early skirmishes over policy, they had not made the toughest decisions. The relationship between Javid and Johnson was strong. Javid invited just three MPs to his recent 50th birthday party. One was the prime minister, who sat on the top table. The attempt inside Downing St to talk Javid round was prolonged and genuine. First, members of Johnson’s staff attempted to change his mind, before a final one-on-one talk between prime minister and chancellor. Johnson is already said to have told senior Tories that he wants Javid back.However, in the week before the reshuffle, Javid’s team became concerned. Briefings emerged in the media, which they believe were designed to unsettle the No10 and No11 relationship – some believe stories about a possible mansion tax were planted, to be used as evidence against Javid and his team. The emergence of the idea on the front page of a newspaper last weekend baffled those working on the budget. The story didn’t seem to serve any purpose, other than to poison the well between No10 and No11, and foment distrust. In reality, insiders say that there were figures inside Downing St interested in a mansion tax, but that there were also sympathisers in the Treasury. However, Javid was already against the idea.There was also a briefing about a fallout between the prime minister’s partner Carrie Symonds and Cummings, suggesting that she was critical of his aggressive approach and argued against sacking Javid. The story cited “well-placed Treasury sources”, but Javid’s allies insist it did not come from them and they detect foul play. “It was dark arts,” said one friend.Treasury sources admit that a mistake was made in its handling of HS2, in which Javid’s backing for the project was announced before No10 had made an official decision to go ahead with the project. Other than that, there was little ammunition to throw at Javid. Indeed, when Javid asked the prime minister why his team should be dismissed, Johnson was unable to offer an argument.The big question is whether Sunak sticks to Javid’s fiscal rule, which promises to balance the books on day-to-day spending by the middle of the parliament. It is this rule that has restricted No10’s hopes of ploughing money into its “levelling up” agenda. The issue of the level of spending is now the coming battle within the Tory party.“You can’t just spend, spend, spend,” said one concerned minister. “Sooner or later, the inherent contradiction of saying ‘the Labour Party spend too much’ will be pointed out if we also decide to spend too much. I think Cummings has overreached himself and there will be grave concern, privately. It’s all right now, with no Labour opposition and no clarity on where the economy is going.“But I say to my Labour colleagues, they had more seats than us in 2005 and five years later, we were in government.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4a4d09760829123893537461c1e0d3c8b4ac347/3748_86_1108_665/master/1108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96e5c9ef837a178bf33a9acd6e47b818","title":"putting men in the frame photography exhibition masculinities liberation barbican","story":"Women have spent centuries under the male gaze. Men, less so. As a new exhibition opens at the Barbican in London,  Luke Turner ponders what today’s increasingly fluid notions of masculinity mean for us allThe male gaze can be harshest when directed at the self. Until puberty, I was blissfully unaware of my own body, aside from the odd graze or bee sting. But then, at the age of 11 or 12, my body became a contested space. In the steaming showers after PE, I compared myself unfavourably to others, both my classmates and what I saw in the wider culture. I’m sure I wasn’t alone in finding that infamous Coca-Cola window-cleaner advert (in which a shirtless man tantalises an office full of women) to be 30 seconds of highly triggering humiliation – and a (low-calorie) modicum of sweet revenge for all the years of men doing the same to women.Yet watching the video again as I write this essay on how to explore the buffeted nature of modern masculinity against the physicality of the male body itself, I can easily recall that awkward, resentful twinge. For the past quarter-century or so, my life staring at men has been a complicated experience – a signal to arousal, yes, but also to fright and flight to self-loathing at my own physical inadequacy.During those years, looking at pictures of men who populate the Barbican’s new exhibition Masculinities: Liberation Through Photography would, like a highbrow take on that TV ad, have sent me to a terrible and negative place. The artfully posed muscular bodies, the confident eye meeting the camera’s lens, the camaraderie among queers and straights alike, the performance of group ritual – they might as well have been aliens. How did I connect with these masculine ideals of fashion and sport?The Barbican exhibition largely features images taken in the decades of gender revolution that followed the Second World War. During successive waves of feminism, women have explored different tactical approaches to redefine themselves against an oppression that stretches back beyond recorded history. Men, however, failed. We never had conversations among ourselves about this realignment, and nor did we seek to engage effectively with what was being said around us. Even gay rights activists and feminists struggled to get along. Instead, we doubled down and hoped it might all go away. The cultural thuggery of 90s laddism was business as usual, the same pernicious attitudes allowed to continue, merely disguised with a veneer of irony.After the joy of a childhood full of parental love, my teenage years coincided with that boorish decade, throughout which mainstream TV programmes from Friends to Fantasy Football were drearily conformist in their representations of gender. Struggling to understand my bisexual identity, I came up against Section 28, which the Tories used to legislate loneliness by forbidding the “promotion” of homosexuality in schools. My all-boys comprehensive was a hormonal soup I despaired at being boiled in, the hierarchy decided by playground football, prowess with girls, expensive sportswear.In the seven years I was there, I never knew of a single out gay or bisexual pupil – just hateful whispers. The deranged and lonely testosterone flood carried me to the dank caverns of local public toilets, where I was taken advantage of by a succession of grim older men. I told myself that this was just a rite of passage, unable to see myself as a victim of these predators who leered at my 14-year-old self through bulging eyes.Men frequently never seem to leave puberty – and destructive patterns become ossified into adulthood. I explored this in a memoir, which I began writing, during a period of intense personal turmoil, as a book about a forest near London. I hadn’t thought it was about masculinity, but bisexuality, bullying, recovery from abuse, depression, isolation, sexual compulsion, even how we define ourselves against or within nature, all of which have at their roots the impossible expectations of gender.I write this not because I think my situation was unique, but because I suspect it was nearly universal. Even those young men who pretend to fit in frequently don’t, but instead are pushed into denying their true complicated selves for the sake of acceptance in the wider group. When are any young men taught to be in touch with their bodies, to explore them as the sensuous manifestation of their true selves? The male mind and body are frequently in a turmoil of shame and self-denial, resulting in a mental health crisis that means suicide is the biggest killer of men under 50 in the UK.Just as I don’t believe anybody is entirely straight or gay, there’s an unrecognised fluidity beyond the self-identified gender fluid. Why do we seem to have forgotten that cis-gendered masculinity is in itself a broad and beautiful, erse spectrum? As Walt Whitman put it in his heroic, erotic and at the time controversial poetic hymn to masculine and feminine personhood, Song of Myself: “I am large, I contain multitudes.” He wrote those lines in the mid-1850s, yet 170 years later, they can still feel ahead of our time.The contemporary debate around gender has hardly helped. It frequently treats masculinity as a lumpen identity, with the accusation of toxicity applied to all. As someone who has spent my life suffering from the consequences of negative maleness, through predatory abuse, biphobia, bullying, the drunken screams of “fucking poof” and that constant and overpowering sense of threat that paves the nocturnal streets of little England, this has been hard to process.I constantly see men pushed to extremes by the nature of the contemporary conversation. I am as wary of a performative wearer of a “This is what a feminist looks like” T-shirt as I am the disciples of the “eat steak and tidy your room” Jordan Peterson doctrine. Both have embraced the comfort of simplistic and binary positions, exactly the opposite of what we all so desperately need. There’s a contradiction in a discourse that on the one hand claims that male privilege, entitlement and the patriarchy are the most powerful forces of oppression humanity has ever created, and on the other would (understandably) like men to process this quickly, and without fuss.If having the upper hand for centuries breeds an entitlement that means men find it hard to realise that they’ve benefitted from systems of male privilege – even if they have frequently been the victims of it – then to deal with this is going to take time. This isn’t to make excuses, but to say that in a world darkened by binary thinking, collaboration and solidarity between all genders is the only thing that will get us through. “Love’s the only engine of survival,” as Leonard Cohen had it, and Leonard Cohen was usually right.Paradoxically, it was the emergence of terms such as “toxic masculinity”, and suddenly feeling myself lumped in within that unpleasant morass, that led me to explore just what my identity as a man might be. I began to unlearn my own prejudices, to suppress that lingering rush of resentment when I saw teenage lads bantering with play punches on the street, or stag-do boys dressed as bananas yelling on the tube.I started to find solidarity in unexpected places. Since my teens I have been an out bisexual man, but a closet fan of West Ham United. My own binary thinking had led me to believe that my sexuality and revulsion at groups of men in football mode was incompatible with enjoying the frequently depressing fortunes of a team once notorious for the violence of a small group of their fans.Indeed, football hooliganism seems to be one of those masculine identities where the actions of a minority toxify the wider group. Eventually, I realised I wouldn’t be subjecting myself to the endless disappointments of following West Ham if I didn’t genuinely care. I started taking this most painful of relationships more seriously. I discovered West Ham’s LGBT+ supporters organisation Pride of Irons – a hilarious, passionate, caring and erse group that encompasses gay, lesbian, straight, bisexual and trans members.At the London Stadium I stand in a communal fug of lager and Dior Sauvage singing I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles, a glorious anthem of optimism in failure, and feel euphoric as I dissolve into the 50,000 people around me to find a curious self-acceptance that for decades has eluded me.Yet I cannot be complacent in this personal victory. I’m not sure how we try to take nuance and make it universal in the current climate. Photography exhibitions in London galleries are all very well, but they can only ever speak to a minority. Instead, we cry out for the kinds of structural change that eventually will create tectonic shifts.We might look to Sweden, where fathers and mothers are given governmental and employer support to split 480 days of parental leave between them. Let’s stop talking of male role models and hope that boys might find inspiration from their elders in all genders.Perhaps the tallest order is to make the language we use less isive. I was struck by the words of Soma Ghosh, writer and editor of radical feminist magazine The Demented Goddess, when she told me of her dislike of the concept of toxic masculinity, and how it might impact her young son: “I don’t want to script, limit or resent his ‘manhood’,” she writes. “At his rural primary school, he calls out homophobia and decries Mary not speaking in his Nativity play as sexist. Would he feel so free to fight for fairness if he felt his masculinity was inevitably harmful, toxic, loathsome?”We need to accept that toxicity in male identity is not elemental and inevitable. Instead, we ought to see it as a by-product of change, a waste substance that, like the slag heaps of industrial ruin, might one day vanish.At my most optimistic, I see green shoots when all around me it feels as if men are finally starting to talk. Even in my adolescence, the boorish chuntering of laddism was a form of silence, where those of us who didn’t conform either shut up or played along. Because men struggle to communicate and often do so within strict linguistic rules and codes, they’re easily stereotyped: model railway enthusiasts as anoraks, football fans as thugs, and so on. Yet some of the most nuanced discussion on the importance of discussing mental health I’ve heard in recent months has been on West Ham fan podcasts.We’re even getting better at expressing our vulnerability when it comes to sex. I recently participated in a documentary about the huge rise in young men taking Viagra. In a community centre with a Nigerian church singing songs of praise next door, seven men discussed the expectations, fears and pressures that had led them to pop the little blue pill. There was crude humour and banter, but also a exploration of performance anxiety and the deep insecurity that so many men feel as we try to make sense of our bodies and the essential drive of our sex against the ubiquitous vortex of hardcore pornography. Complexly intertwined with the cruelty of unrealistic body image in advertising and on TV, this garish scroll of grunting is an engine of misogyny that exploits and inflames male insecurity.Only in frank honesty and acceptance will we get beyond these painful orthodoxies and myths that hold us back. If I look in the mirror and then back at those images from the Barbican exhibition, I am struck by John Coplans’s photograph Frieze No 2 – Four Panels, of a naked male body covered in a rough scrub of hair over curving belly, Martian canals in the loose skin over elbows and below buttocks. It’s an image at once sensual, affirming and familiar.I’ve recently entered middle age, when suddenly my body feels like one of those diagrams on which you mark damage when hiring a car – two weak knees that crunch when I sit, constantly needing to get up for a piss in the night, humped shoulders, nose hair, terrifying twinges, two-day hangovers. I had often felt I had missed out on being a man, yet looking at my own body, and that photograph, I finally recognise and feel a comfort in my slow ache towards the grave.“Liberation” is an appropriate title for the Barbican’s exhibition. We’ve all heard of women’s lib, but the term has never been applied to men, more in need of liberating than anyone. After all, the structures and webs of codes and expectations that hold men down are the same as manifest in the death grip of patriarchy. Liberate men, and we liberate us all.Masculinities: Liberation through Photography is at Barbican Art Gallery from 20 February to 17 May 2020 (barbican.org.uk).

Two months later, when the first video (of Karim briefly describing the elephant enclosure at the San Diego Zoo) was uploaded, a platform was launched that has gone on to change the world.As more money and more eyeballs have entered the frame, the level of competition has increased. What was once a site for hobbyists has turned into a mini-Hollywood, with huge teams of staff churning out content for demanding fans.As the website celebrates its 15-year anniversary, five of its significant early stars explain how their relationship with the site has evolved.‘I created a character a lot of girls could relate to’A friend uploaded some videos on to YouTube in 2006, and he asked me to make an account so I could support him. The site was only a year old then, and I didn’t understand the concept. I used to think it was called “U2” – I couldn’t understand why a band would have a website that hosted videos. Finally, someone spelled it out for me, so I logged in and created an account. “OlgaKay” was the password to my bank account at the time, so I used that. It was the first thing that came to mind.I was mesmerised by these people talking to the camera. I’d never seen that before. I was so inside their world. I remember thinking: I have a personality I could share, maybe I could do this. Maybe I could do it better…The problem was that back then I didn’t know how to create content. My background was in the circus. I was a juggler, somewhat familiar with live performances, but I didn’t know how to be on camera. It was a huge learning curve, trying to figure out what this whole thing was about, and building a career. I created this character of an emo girl who hated everything about her life. I played that character, then I played myself as her roommate. One character was positive, one was negative. I think a lot of young girls could relate to that.By 2014 I had 1m subscribers and was producing 23 videos a week. My main channel was scripted content, highly produced. The second channel was a daily documentary, to which I uploaded at least five videos a week, and then I had a fashion and beauty channel (three videos a week) and a gaming channel (14 videos a week). I covered all the bases and all the genres on YouTube, but I was making so many videos that I was burned out. I realised that to continue to be successful on YouTube I had to keep pumping out content. I felt like my creativity was slipping away. I pictured myself running a production company, creating more and more content, trying to stay relevant among teenagers. I thought: I don’t want to be a 40-year-old woman still making content. I didn’t want to be someone who has to wake up every morning and put makeup on to go in front of the camera.In 2016, I stepped away and took a long hiatus, during which time my audience disappeared. I wasn’t uploading regularly enough. In that time I read a lot of books. I read The Success Principles by Jack Canfield four times, which rewired my brain.I woke up one day thinking, “I am an entrepreneur, I want to create a business.” That business became Moosh Walks: knee-high socks with ears. That same year I opened a pop-up shop in Los Angeles, where I live, to see how my product performed outside my fanbase. Now we’re in 130 stores across America, and we’re on Amazon, and we’re growing. YouTube gave me this. It gave me knowledge and experience.‘My first film was 6 minutes long. It was just a rambly mess’I got on to YouTube in 2007 by procrastinating. This was when nobody was making any real money from YouTube. It hadn’t started its partnership programme. I started my own channel because I wanted to make a short film with a friend, a parody of one of the Legend of Zelda games. We never actually made it, but we made a bad trailer for it – Windows Movie Maker titles, copy- righted music. Then I set up a series called Fun Science and tried to answer questions about the world.After I launched the channel, I found other video bloggers and realised that this was a thing people were doing. The webcam I had then cost £15, and the videos were awful quality. The first video blog I made was six minutes long, which at the time was a silly length. You’d never make one that long now. It was just a rambly mess.In 2017 I moved to Canada with my girlfriend. I was ready to leave the UK. There’s that phrase: if you’re sick of London, you’re sick of life. I was honestly sick of London. I’d kind of stopped video blogging by that point, even though I had millions of subscribers. I’d already burned out once before, in 2013, and then found it hard to upload a new video every week. I realised I felt much happier not being on camera, and I felt increasingly as if I was putting on a mask and being somebody else. Viewers equated my digital presence with my real-life one. That’s one of the things I know about myself now: I find it much more creatively fulfilling to be working behind the scenes.Around the time I moved to Toronto, I began working with New Form, a production company that works with video bloggers who are interested in filmmaking. A show I made was picked up by Jeffrey Katzenberg, a Hollywood bigwig, who has no idea who I am in terms of my YouTube career. (It stars Don Cheadle, and will be out next year.)I have a few different feature scripts I’m working on, ideas for TV pilots. I’m working the filmmaker grind. I haven’t ruled out coming back to YouTube entirely, but I think if I ever do come back, I want it to be what it used to be – more of a hobby, a creative outlet. I’d have a proper job elsewhere. I definitely used to see YouTube as my proper job. I had 2m subscribers! But I guess it isn’t for me any more.‘Without YouTube I wouldn’t be making my own music’I started on YouTube 10 years ago, when I was seven. All I did back then was sing – my dream at the time was to become the next Adele – but I never really had a platform. My mum suggested doing YouTube. It was only a few years old at that point, and I was over-the-moon excited about it. I drew pictures of what I would look like on screen.I did my first video and just got hooked, and then did it again and again and again. Here we are, 350 videos later. When I filmed that first video, I was really nervous. I thought that if I wore the same outfit out in the street people would recognise me instantly, even though I had, like, three subscribers. I got more than 100 views on that first video in a week, and it just went up from there. I had my first viral video three videos later, a cover of Hallelujah. It grew and grew.It started turning serious when I was nine. We went from using an old Canon camcorder to a proper, professional camera, and we’ve upgraded again to a completely new one, though it’s still a family production. My videos go out on a Friday. On Monday I’ll pick a track, one with the most views at that moment, or a classic song everybody knows. Then we’ll get a track made – it will take me a few hours to record – and every Wednesday we film a video. That will either be a whole day or half a day. Then we’ll edit it the next day and it’s straight out for Friday. Sometimes we’ll do full production videos with dancers and all sorts. They’re big, two-day shoots.I’m not interested in being a superstar or whatever. I just like making music and content, and making people happy. But we’ve done so much. I got to perform at Wembley Arena when I was about 11. That was definitely one of my favourite moments: getting to walk out on the stage and say “Hello, Wembley!” In Germany I performed in front of 17,000 people, which was insane.YouTube’s helped me get to the point where I can write and produce my own music and release it to the public. That’s just the best feeling in the world. Without YouTube I never would have got to that point, never would have had those opportunities. Without it I’d be nothing right now. I can’t imagine a life without YouTube. It has its ups and downs, when there’s too much going on, when you’re juggling school and your digital presence, and you have to try to fit everything in. But at the end of the day it’s all moving me towards this one goal – to one day tour the world.‘It was embarrassing to be known for playing Fifa online’I thought it would be easy, but I quickly learned it was a grind. You had to get your own content out, have your own ideas, develop your own personality. When I was on 2,500 subscribers I was walking through school and a kid said to me: “Aren’t you Manny from YouTube?” That shook me. It was almost embarrassing to be known for playing Fifa online, especially in sixth form. I don’t know when I realised I was popular.I dropped out of an accounting and finance course at university when I got to 60,000 subscribers. The accounting and finance skills would come in useful now, but I didn’t stay long enough – balancing uni and YouTube was difficult. Within a month of dropping out I hit 100,000 subscribers, and from there it grew rapidly – 30,000 new subscribers a month. Now I have 1.7m.At the start of every year I ask: can I do this for another 12 months? Most years, the answer is no. It’s getting tough – it’s difficult to keep up the consistency. At times I’ve stopped posting every day, and sometimes I fall out of love with it. But my videos are seen by 250,000 people a day. I’m back to my most consistent now, almost doing daily uploads. My last 50 videos have been posted in the last 57 days. It can be draining, but I’m trying to find a balance.YouTube has changed in many ways. There’s a lot of things I do now that get half the number of the views it would have got when I started. It was a lot easier to get views with less back then. Now, it’s all about the titles and the thumbnails and making sure everything’s clickable. If it’s not clickable, it won’t get the views. You don’t need to make good content to get views on YouTube these days.‘I decided to help others who were doing their own videos’I started in a small town called Knysna, in South Africa. It was 2010 and I was 16. I did it because I wanted to impress the other kids at school I thought it would be cool for them to watch videos I’d made. But it had the opposite effect – everyone thought it was lame. For two years I was that weird YouTube kid, creating weird videos about my life.In 2012, my final year of school, I’d earned enough to become a full-time YouTuber and move to London. The goal wasn’t to stay there for very long – it was just to work with other creators and build an audience. But it eventually evolved into the place I spend most of my time. Now I’ve got 7m subscribers. People watch me do challenges: bleach my hair, or live in my car. If you’d asked me when I started, I wouldn’t have thought that many people would even be using YouTube. A big channel used to have 1m subscribers. Now they have 100m.There’s always a natural insecurity when it comes to doing well in something. You ask yourself: how long can this last? So a way of protecting myself was to ersify away from just making my own content. As someone with experience on the platform, I decided to help other creators who were beginning to monetise their videos. I set up a company called Influencer with a guy called Ben Jeffries.A girl I went on a Tinder date with introduced me to Ben – so I guess you could say we were a Tinder success story. We started Influencer with the goal of providing creators with another form of income – it allows people to earn money from product mentions in their content. We have more than 7,000 creators on our platform.I also set up a talent management company called Margravine Management, with Joe Sugg, my business partner and good friend, and the Creative Investment Club, which invests in startups alongside some of the best venture capitalists in the UK.

I find someone who can fulfil that role who is really good – and then I go into business with them.

If it is fear, whether unfounded or founded, Evans says to confront the worst-case scenario: “It may not be as bad as we think.” Figure out what knowledge or skills you are lacking, and delegate if you can. If you’re paralysed by the need to get it right, Evans suggests honestly confronting whether “‘perfect’ is really what’s needed” – or if it is more important just to get it done. “Sometimes we procrastinate over tasks that aren’t really that important.”Tim Pychyl, founder of the Procrastination Research Group and associate professor of psychology at Carleton University, Ottawa, says procrastination boils down to an “emotion-focused coping response”: by putting off the task, we get rid of the bad feeling. Start by simply identifying the first step: “Ask yourself, ‘What is the next action I would take on this task, if I was going to do it?’” And make it really tiny. The idea is to move your focus away from how you’re feeling, and towards what Pychyl calls a “low-threshold entry to action”: “We can’t deny our feelings, but we can pay less attention to them … and our research has shown that getting started is key.” Evans suggests working on the task for 10 to 15 minutes and no more, just so as to have made a start.“Giving yourself a hard time only makes it worse,” says productivity expert Moyra Scott. “In order to beat procrastination you have to realise that it is very common. We are human. We procrastinate.” It can help to clarify or visualise what “done” looks like, she says: “What is the finish line you are aiming at?” Hal E Hershfield, an associate professor of marketing and behavioural decision making at UCLA Anderson School of Management, pictures himself having to do a task today that he actually completed yesterday.“ That’s most likely how I’ll feel tomorrow if I push off something that I’m meant to do today. The idea is to try to connect with the person I’ll be in the future and the emotions that I will eventually feel.”Judson A Brewer, a neuroscientist and director of Research and Innovation at the Mindfulness Centre at Brown University, says procrastination has its origins in reward-based learning: a trigger (think about a deadline), a behaviour (scroll social media), then a reward (distract from the unpleasant thought). Willpower alone is often not enough to overcome such a powerful impulse, evolved to help us remember where to find food. But by making ourselves aware of our habit loops, says Brewer, we give ourselves the opportunity to break them. “Curiosity is like a superpower that can help us notice these urges simply as thoughts, emotions and body sensations, and then move on to the task at hand.” The reward can be reframed as the feeling of accomplishment, instead of the relief (tempered by guilt and building anxiety) of a momentary distraction. “Reflecting on the rewarding properties of not procrastinating builds healthy habits that become stronger than procrastination itself – hacking our brain in the process.”Productivity coach Grace Marshall says one common misconception about productivity is that it is “just about nailing yourself to the seat, and getting it done”. While that is sometimes effective (and, if a deadline is looming, necessary), it can be a stressful approach, she says – “and as willpower is a depleting resource, it’s not sustainable”. Her suggestion is to stop trying to overpower or ignore the primitive part of our brain driving procrastination, and instead try to distract it. Tell yourself: “I’m not really going to work on this right now, I’m just going to open the file and make some notes.” Play – turning the task into a game or an experiment – can also be an effective ersion. As Marshall writes: “Fighting the monkey is exhausting, and it doesn’t work very well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbf83372d452e010454fd7860c0889379a04c5cf/0_343_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12a4c9781f3ba9b129dedfedde25764d","title":"i look at the clock its 3am why women cant sleep","story":"While her husband snores peacefully beside her, Mariella Frostrup, like women everywhere, is wide awake – mind spinning. But why? And what can she do about it?It is 3am. I know because I’ve checked the clock three times since I crept to the loo at 1.45am. Within minutes of my return to bed I feel the delicious fog of slumber evaporate, my heart rate rises and my brain begins its relentless scan for topics to keep me engaged. Occasionally, I get a laugh out of what I dream up as a priority worry more often I’m shocked by the banality. A thank you note I failed to send a year ago the small part for a kitchen appliance I keep forgetting to order whether I booked Ocado for Friday whether Stormzy will agree to talk to me about his favourite books the shirt my son needs guilt because I didn’t call my friend with breast cancer where to go on summer holidays how to get the car to its service in Yeovil why the person I discussed documentary ideas with hasn’t replied did I book a blowdry on Tuesday? And where has that blue dress gone?I look at the clock again, it’s 3.15am and I’m getting closer to the moment when I’m going to have to medicate or resign myself to staying awake. Now adding to my copious preoccupations: what do I have to do in the morning? Can I afford to be exhausted or should I resort to the cornucopia of drugs and sleep aids crammed into my bedside drawer? While I attempt to follow the cognitive behavioural therapy advice I’ve been given and count my breaths – five in, five out – to restore my equilibrium and compartmentalise the turmoil, my husband snores deafeningly beside me.He’s deep in a contented sleep that not even the alarm clock can halt, but if he knew how close to homicide this nightly inequity takes me, he wouldn’t be so relaxed. The tedium of my thoughts is frequently alleviated by a switch to murderous intent as my addled, sleep-deprived brain imagines how easily I could slide the pillow over his face and banish his noisy presence permanently.Despite a century of emancipation, women still do most of the backstage work that keeps the show on the road. Scratch the surface of this national insomnia pandemic and you discover that inequality is at the heart of the malaise. Aside from sexual politics and headline grabbers, such as #MeToo, most women’s lives aren’t improving quantifiably, they’re just different from 50 years ago.“It’s great that men and women are equals in the workplace, but what this means in reality is that women are effectively taking on twice the load,” says Dr Elle Boag, associate professor in social psychology at Birmingham City University. “Only too often we do the work, the domestic labour and the childcare (to be fair, sometimes these chores are shared). We’ve adopted this multitasking role and it’s become normative.” So, it’s no surprise that when we go to bed we find we can’t switch off.I’m one of the lucky ones. I married a man who can cook, adores being with his kids, can put up a shelf and, if I scream loud enough, will pick his dirty clothes up from on top of the laundry basket and put them inside it. He’s also brilliant at labelling, especially now he has a little machine to do it, and all his cupboards are helpfully marked up: socks, cardigans, long-sleeve T-shirts and so on. It may not feel like it, but apparently family structure has changed. “It’s all about expectation. Within almost a generation-and-a-half, we’ve shifted from the extended family to the nuclear family,” says Russell Foster, professor of circadian neuroscience at Oxford University. “This means that childcare is focused on the parents, and usually the mother, meaning she’s on call all the time. This in turn leads to awful guilt about not coping, which translates to stress, and therefore sleeplessness.”This certainly explains the medley of uncompleted chores that plays on repeat through the small hours to the accompaniment of rain falling on my Calm app.There’s also scientific speculation as to why men should be so deeply and contentedly asleep while women stay awake. “The data emerging suggests women tend to be more conscientious, as well as more flexible in the workplace. Work duration extends, meaning there isn’t enough time for everything else. So, you invade the night, and sleep is the first victim,” says Foster. In other words, women are sacrificing sleep in order to get everything done.It’s not quite the portrait of “having it all” we battle-weary veterans of three waves of feminism were expecting – millions of our sex, faces illuminated by the sleep- banishing blue light of our smart phones and PCs, organising play dates, ordering groceries, answering emails and trying to maintain our social lives into the early hours.The more cynically inclined might ask, who cares? You’re going to be dead soon enough, so you’ll get to catch up on your 40 winks for all eternity. It’s a fair point except that we’re all expected to stay active until we’re well into our 70s and 80s and the downsides of lack of sleep start with exhaustion and continue down a depressing spiral of health concerns, including increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, obesity and depression. In the light of these health dangers, getting enough sleep becomes an imperative. Foster agrees: “If you have a racing mind and continuously turn on the stress axis, elevated levels of cortisol suppress the immune system, which predisposes you to infection, and may even be responsible for higher rates of cancer. You’re throwing glucose into your circulation and changing the metabolic hormones: ghrelin, the hunger hormone, is released when you’re tired, and leptin, the satiation hormone, is reduced.”But how do we break this vicious cycle? So many of the health issues that are costing the NHS millions and debilitating the population in middle age are directly related to or influenced by the amount of sleep we get. And the gender gap is as apparent in our inability to sleep as it is in ision of childcare.“Men and women have different circadian rhythms, meaning that men are likely to go to bed later,” says Dr Neil Stanley, a sleep expert and author of How to Sleep Well. “This is evolutionary, from the times when women went to sleep with the babies and men stayed up later to ensure there was no danger. Only then would they too go to bed.”These days such “protection” of their nearest and dearest is more likely to take the form of a bottle of red wine and a couple of episodes of Fortitude. “When men do go to bed, they often disturb the lighter-sleeping women, who then struggle to go back to sleep,” adds Stanley.Although it’s tempting, I can’t lay the entire burden of a nation of insomniac women on men not picking up the slack. Another reason experts give for our lack of quality sleep is that we simply aren’t moving enough.Women’s sleep deprivation may once have been synonymous with menopause, but as Why We Can’t Sleep outlines, being wide awake while the (male) world sleeps is no longer the preserve of the 50-plus struggling with hormone deficiencies. Young working mothers are almost as afflicted as Generation Xers, suggesting that it’s societal pressure rather than biological programming that’s at the root of our nocturnal nightmares. I know I’m not unique. The hardest part of becoming a parent, in my case extremely late, has been the extending of my working day to include two jobs: one running our home and the other my paid labour.At a family get-together, I listened to one of my brothers arguing for the principle of a universal basic income, citing experiments in wealthy countries like Norway. It struck me as I listened to this impassioned, childless, metrosexual that the real “equaliser” would be something much more specific – bring back the pioneering Wages for Housework campaign of the 1970s, led by an international collective that described housework as “capitalist abuse”. The domestic burden shouldered by the majority of women has a long-term devastating impact on women’s finances.Having established some of the contributors to our insomnia, I’ve been looking for answers. So far I’ve tried CBD (quite helpful) having a bath with lavender oil (occasionally helpful) sleeping pills (very helpful, but I don’t want to be addicted) white noise (better than just the sound of my thoughts rattling around) melatonin (in small doses and taken regularly it definitely helps and it’s available on the NHS, but only for over 55s) Horlicks (just makes me thirsty) doing less work (works a treat, but hard to pay the bills) the Calm app (pleasantly distracting) and HRT (studies show it can help with sleeplessness in menopause, although it didn’t resolve the problem for me).Now, a new book, Fair Play by Eve Rodsky, sets out a plan to highlight the real cause of so much of our insomnia: the less-burdened partner sleeping next to us. Promising to press the reset button on your relationship by equally iding the domestic burden, it gets the thumbs-up from none other than Reese Witherspoon. The actor describes it as “a hands-on guide for navigating the hot-button issues that so many families struggle with”.With chapter titles like “Living in Your Unicorn Space”, it seemed to me a bit dubious, but the rules Rodsky asks us to enforce, starting with All Time is Created Equal, are sensible enough. More compellingly, Reese looks like she gets plenty of sleep and remembers to book her blowdry, and runs a successful company and has her own book club – and even has two children. How does she manage to have it all? There’s something to fixate on in the small hours.Meanwhile, join me in one last great revolutionary moment – where we recognise, call out and reapportion the domestic burden that’s trapping women in an unsustainable pattern of insomnia and stress.

The presenter was found dead on Saturday.In the now-deleted story, the Sun highlighted the card mocking the alleged assault of her boyfriend Lewis Burton in December.The “exclusive” story about the card quoted the card illustrator, Samuel Hague, who said his latest creation has been left “blank inside for your personal message” and comes with a “good quality red envelope”.When asked about the card, he said: “There’s nothing I wish to add. I’m surprised that’s the card you choose to write about. I’ve joked about far worse.”Love Island has attracted substantial press coverage for the aftercare support given to it contestants, after two people who had previously taken part in the hit ITV2 show killed themselves. The channel has insisted that these deaths happened long after the iniduals were on the show.Love Island has proved to be a financial cash cow for the broadcaster which last summer made clear it would provide substantial aftercare support to those who take part in the programme.Flack was due to host Love Island’s first winter edition, which is currently being broadcast from Cape Town in South Africa, but was replaced at the last minute by Laura Whitmore.After being charged with assault, Flack was forced to stay away from her boyfriend and had severely limited her social media output.On Saturday afternoon the Sun’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, paid tribute to Flack: “Caroline was hung out to dry by ITV. She was distraught they didn’t stand by her. And distraught about the lack of support she was given. Caroline and I were devastated to attend the funeral of our friend Mike Thalassitis last year. I cannot believe we are here again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/102f97e95a894e9c20fd11c7204123caa3463d1b/10_308_4718_2831/master/4718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf01c9c6d5fdf2a1f28b13c6413c4621","title":"james blunt review beige balladeer turns up the self deprecating charm","story":"Birmingham ArenaBlunt brings his social media wit to a Valentine’s day show in which the best moments are the most personalHaving a global smash as couple-friendly as You’re Beautiful would often cast a singer-songwriter as gooey but wearily earnest “serious artist”. But James Blunt tore up the script, using social media to reinvent himself as a troll-obliterating, self-deprecating wit. When a chap tweeted him fretting that he was “really enjoying James Blunt’s new album” (Once Upon a Mind), the 45-year-old former army captain shot back: “It’s the menopause.”This is the persona Blunt brings to concerts, which may have been a fiendish career move but seems to come naturally. He jokes that people are “weird, but lovely” to attend his gig on Valentine’s night and reveals that Elton John advised him to always play the hits. “That’s me fucked. I’d have to play You’re Beautiful 22 times.” He dedicates a song to “couples” and with comic timing introduces Goodbye My Lover, a song about a crushing breakup, performed with the intensity he wrote it.Blunt deadpans that he sings “miserable songs”, which can be true, but mostly they’re just very personal, whether eulogising a beautiful dawn (High) or ruminating on regrets (The Truth). Superstardom – and the need to fill arenas – presumably account for the more anodyne “whoah ohh”-packed Stay the Night and 5 Miles – uptempo grabs at the ColdplayEd Sheeran market.Still, there is more to Captain Blunt than oft-ridiculed beige balladeer. Postcards, played on ukulele, has hints of Cockney Rebel. Singing duo Ward Thomas’s female vocals bring Fleetwood Mac vibes to Halfway, and 1973 is rendered as a vintage Elton stomp. It’s unclear whether Wisemen’s line about “a semi by the sea” is a deliberate double-entendre, although the singer recently revealed that You’re Beautiful is about “me, stalking someone else’s girlfriend while high”. Contrarily, Monsters, Blunt’s stunningly raw farewell to his ailing father, is surely the most powerful song he’s done. Blunt dashes off – something in his eye – but isn’t going to leave on a downbeat moment. “Last time I was here I called you Nottingham,” he says with a cringe. “You were very forgiving.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

It calls on Labour to expel “transphobic” members, and describes campaigns including Woman’s Place UK as “trans-exclusionist hate groups”.Woman’s Place UK has now written to the leadership figures demanding to see the evidence behind the claim. The group has also written to the candidates who have not signed the pledge, asking to meet them to discuss the growing row. It said none of the candidates had yet replied.The Labour Campaign for Trans Rights pledge states that the party has “failed to act as transphobia has gained ground” within the party. It said last week it was “heartened by the solidarity” of the Labour candidates. It reiterated its view that Woman’s Place UK perpetuated discrimination against trans people. It is the latest development in a growing row within the party. Woman’s Place UK is pushing for ministers to consult more widely about changes to the Gender Recognition Act, which would allow people to legally self-identify as a man or a woman without medical approval.It rejects accusations that it is transphobic and trans-exclusionist. Its founders say it aims to “ensure that women’s voices are heard and our sex-based rights upheld”. However, critics say it is trying to limit the rights of trans people.In a letter to Lisa Nandy, Ruth Serwotka, a Woman’s Place UK founder, wrote: “I hope you understand that expulsions of women from the party on the grounds you are suggesting (and being cavalier about evidence) will provoke a huge backlash. It will be fiercely opposed by all fair-minded members, who insist on reason and evidence.“In fact, we are a women’s rights organisation committed, among other things, to upholding current sex discrimination and equality law as set out in the Equality Act (2010), including upholding protections for trans people”.Nandy’s team declined to comment.

The Tories had a simple message that was “unchallengable”, he suggested.Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said in a separate interview that their policy was right and it was not the sole reason the party suffered its worst election defeat since 1935.McDonnell’s intervention is the first time he has given such a frank assessment on the policy he helped devise and how it may have ultimately hit Labour at the ballot box. He said the party should now drop the issue for a generation and accept that Brexit was happening.“The reality now is Brexit is going to happen. It’s can we get a Brexit that at least protects jobs and the economy. And can we establish a new relationship with Europe,” he said.McDonnell will retire to the backbenches when a new Labour leader is elected, and one of his first jobs then will be to establish connections with socialist parties in the EU to see how they can agree a policy programme for the future of the left in Europe without Britain in the EU.Days before voters went to the polls, McDonnell said he thought Labour’s plan would stop Brexit supporters flocking to the Tories. He claimed the party would negotiate a “credible and sensible” withdrawal agreement with the EU within three months of forming a government, and then put that deal to a referendum within six months.In that scenario he would have campaigned for remain, and he was part of a powerful clique in the shadow cabinet alongside Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, and Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary. However, he admitted in his interview: “You can’t buck democracy.”McDonnell said: “We were caught in a vice. And the vice was between do we go for a full remain and lose more leave seats, or do we go for full leave and lose remain seats?”He suggested the party would have succumbed to a 150-seat Tory majority had it not struck upon a policy that straddled both viewpoints. He claimed the party managed to pull back votes from the Liberal Democrats while attempting to retain Labour leave voters with stronger policies on NHS funding. The Tory majority in the end was 80.McDonnell said it was not possible to tell for certain whether advocating for a stronger leave position would have produced a different outcome. “If people think that’s their number one issue, what better can you offer them than that hard simple message from the Tories and the Brexit party, which was unchallengeable in that sense,” he said.On Sunday Starmer confidently backed the policy he helped negotiate and said he would have gone further and pushed the leadership to tell members which side they would campaign for.Asked on the Sophy Ridge on Sunday show on Sky News if it was the right policy, Starmer said: “Of course.” He said: “I thought it was the right policy. I thought we should have gone on by the way and said which side we would be campaigning on if there was a referendum and I warned our party that if we looked indecisive, we wouldn’t look like we were leading on this issue.”He said going into an election saying Labour would try to get another deal was the right thing to do because Boris Johnson’s proposals “would be very damaging for our country”.Other members of the shadow cabinet have said since the election defeat that they repeatedly warned the party not to back another referendum on Brexit and to lean more towards their leave-supporting voters.The shadow cabinet secretary, Jon Trickett, said the policy was a mistake while the party chair, Ian Lavery, said Labour ended up trying to “foist” a remain position on working-class communities.Starmer said Brexit was only one of several reasons for Labour’s election loss. He said: “I think we all take responsibility for that devastating election loss. People brought up the leadership of the Labour party, fairly or unfairly they brought up Brexit in different ways – what was said in the Midlands was different to what was said here in Scotland they brought up the fact that they thought the manifesto was overloaded and they didn’t believe we could deliver it all and in a number of places they brought up antisemitism.”Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey are through to the final stage of the Labour leadership contest, where members are balloted on whom they want to succeed Corbyn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21427aa106a84e044c529c6fb3d2d370011bff86/704_1399_4613_2767/master/4613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=792aa091464d9113da8aa817282c57a7","title":"womens equality party candidate pulls out of london mayoral race","story":"Mandu Reid will replace Sue Black, who was forced to withdraw after vaginal mesh implant complicationsThe Women’s Equality party’s candidate for London mayor has been forced to pull out of the race after suffering complications from a vaginal mesh implant.The party claims Prof Sue Black has been a victim of entrenched “health inequalities” affecting thousands of women and that it will be campaigning to get the mesh permanently banned in the UK.Black, a leading computer scientist and government adviser said: “I’m really frustrated because I can’t go on to do what I wanted to. It’s devastating. We need to make sure women know how detrimental this can be for their health.”The WEP leader, Mandu Reid, will take over as the party’s candidate for the mayoral election on 7 May.After a trans-vaginal tape implant in 2005, following the birth of her fourth child, Black said the incontinence she had been suffering from was treated immediately.Ten years later, symptoms including pelvic pain, lumps over her body and severe thirst in the middle of the night, eventually led to the diagnosis she was suffering complications from the mesh having shrunk and hardened. Medical scans showed it was cutting through her urethra.She had one operation to partially remove the mesh 18 months ago and another before Christmas, but the process left her drained and suffering from anaemia.“I feel like I’m getting my energy back having been incapacitated for a month. I could hardly walk upstairs, but doing something like running for mayor of London – you’ve got to be on top form.“Since it was a partial removal I’ve got to have another operation at some point. So that will be three operations I didn’t need to have. I wouldn’t choose this for anybody.”Black, who is a professor of computer science at Durham University, is a longterm campaigner for women’s rights and first came to London to escape an abusive relationship. By the age of 25 she was a single mum with three small children and was living in a women’s refuge. After taking an education access course as a night-class, she then studied for her degree and PhD before entering academia.She was selected as the Women’s Equality party candidate for mayor last summer.According to the NHS, between 2008-09 and 2016-17, 100,516 patients had a reported tape insertion procedure for stress urinary incontinence and a further 27,016 patients had a mesh fitted for urogynaecological prolapse. Hundreds of women are now getting them removed.The products were “aggressively hustled” by manufacturers into widespread use from the late 1990s, according to an investigation by the British Medical Journal.Vaginal mesh is banned from use in the UK over safety concerns although the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says it could be reintroduced in very specific circumstances. The Medicines and Medical Devices bill announced in the Queen’s speech last December also has campaigners concerned about the potential for re-adoption.The government said it would “capitalise on opportunities to ensure that our NHS and patients can have faster access to innovative medicines”, which left Reid concerned there could be a relaxation of regulations.She said: “What has happened to Sue shouldn’t have happened to anyone but it highlights why having the Women’s Equality party is so important and why we need a seat at the table.“This is a political issue – not a niche health issue. This affects thousands of women. New Zealand, Australia and the US have banned vaginal mesh so we should also be going for an outright ban.”The City Hall project worker, who helped deliver the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games said her campaign to be mayor of London will focus on lobbying for the establishment of a women’s health institute in London.“We need to get over our squeamishness on issues like vaginal mesh and make London the vanguard of health inequalities that women are facing,” Reid said.Tackling domestic violence and London’s significant gender pay gap will also be her key campaigning issues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4846e73088f977dbc4a8b9e4e839eb74b2b01bc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dba4eb9a7d4e63f486b661a457466e","title":"i finally had control it was my account starting over again in emergency accommodation","story":"For a woman staying in refuge, sorting out a new bank account is made all the more difficult when you can’t reveal the addressI suffered domestic abuse for several years when I was with my husband. The abuse would be in the house, but in front of others he would act completely differently. I was trapped, too frightened to leave, given all that he had done to me and threatened to do. He controlled every aspect of my life, including the finances. He set up a joint account, but the Jobseeker’s Allowance came in his name and only he accessed that account. I would have to ask him for money, even for basic essentials.After many years I eventually found a way to leave him. I was supported by Birmingham and Solihull Women’s Aid, who found me emergency temporary accommodation in a refuge.One bank saw me three times and gave me false hope, each time saying that they would accept. Then in the final appointment they said the manager had now refused because I didn’t have an address. I was so upset and frustrated. It was like I didn’t matter, nobody cared. It was humiliating and again I had no control. I was worried how I would manage without the universal credit money. I had to feed my children. We had been surviving with support from my family and donations.Staff at the refuge then told me that HSBC UK had started a new way to open an account for women in refuges, a way in which we did not have to give the refuge address. An appointment was made and I attended a branch of HSBC UK far away from the shelter with staff support. They were patient and really kind to the kids and me. During the appointment I did think they would say no at any moment, but when they said the account was open I was so relieved.I finally had control. It was my account. I could make my own decisions, and buy the kids the things they needed, without having to beg or fear his anger.HSBC UK is working with local housing and homelessness charities to provide bank accounts to people without a fixed address, helping to break the cycle of financial exclusion.

Whether you are mastering a new language or a musical instrument, or taking a career-changing course, initial enthusiasm can only take you so far, and any further progress can be disappointingly slow.From these struggles, you might assume that you simply lack a natural gift – compared to those lucky people who can learn any new skill with apparent ease.However, it needn’t be this way. Many polymaths – including Charles Darwin and the Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman – claimed not to have exceptional natural intelligence. Most of us have more than enough brainpower to master a new discipline, if we apply it correctly – and the latest neuroscience offers many strategies to do just that.Much research in the field hinges on the idea of “desirable difficulties”, pioneered by Profs Robert and Elizabeth Bjork at the University of California, Los Angeles. The aim is to deliberately create a slight feeling of frustration as you learn, which leads the brain to process the material more deeply, creating longer-lasting memories. It’s like physical exercise: you need to feel a bit of resistance to make significant long-term gains.Unfortunately, many of our preferred learning techniques – such as reading and highlighting textbooks, or the drawing of colourful “mind maps” to summarise material – don’t offer enough mental challenge to make the information stick, leading to disappointing results. “Our judgment about our learning is often biased towards strategies that feel easy and effortless,” says Dr Carolina Kuepper-Tetzel, a psychologist at the University of Glasgow and member of the Learning Scientists website. “But they don’t translate into long-term retention of knowledge.”The following strategies will help you overcome these bad habits. Whatever you plan to learn, they will make your memory the envy of others.Let’s begin with the pre-test – a strategy that is perhaps best explained with an example.How do you say “thank you” in Finnish? After taking the pre-test, you also want to continue quizzing yourself on what you’ve just learned. To psychologists, this is called “retrieval practice” and it is one of the most reliable ways of building stronger memory traces. In carefully controlled studies, retrieval practice vastly outperforms other strategies such as mind-mapping the material as you study.As Dr Kuepper-Tetzel explains: “Testing is usually seen as a way to assess knowledge. However, testing in itself is a potent learning strategy and has been shown to increase long-term retention of knowledge.”This may be one reason why flashcards – a common form of self-testing – don’t work as well as they could. If you think self-testing is purely a means of assessing your recall, you may peek at the answer too soon – whereas you need to truly rack your brain before giving in, if you want to form the stronger memory. “The harder retrieval is, the more the memory for the information is enhanced,” says Prof Mirjam Ebersbach at the University of Kassel in Germany.If you are studying for exams, try to create your own questions rather than relying on past papers. Ebersbach has found that the process of question generation can itself reinforce learning, since it forces you to reformulate the material in a new way.Perhaps the most potent technique is to teach the material to another person, since that forces you to demonstrate a deep conceptual understanding. If you don’t have a willing partner, you could imagine describing it to someone, or draft an email setting out what you’ve learned in as much detail as possible.Try not to spend too long on any one topic – rather, switch between them regularly. If you are learning a new language, for example, you might rotate between two or three vocabulary topics, or switch between the different verb tenses you are practising, rather than studying them in turn in blocks. This strategy is called interleaving and like the pre-test, it can feel frustrating since you can’t really get into the swing of things before moving on. But according to the theory of desirable difficulties, that is why it works. Numerous studies have shown that this momentary confusion hugely increases your long-term recall.Besides boosting factual learning, interleaving can also accelerate your acquisition of motor skills. If you are learning a musical instrument, for instance, you might alternate between scales and the pieces of music that you are practising.Contrary to the stereotype of the sedentary geek, the best learners are also the most physically active, since cardiovascular exercise triggers the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and epinephrine that are essential for memory formation. This means that your mind will be most fertile after a morning jog or a trip to the gym. So try to schedule your learning around your existing fitness plan and you may experience a natural memory boost.Have you ever noticed that when you return to your home town, recollections of distant events suddenly come flooding back? That’s because our memory is context-dependent – meaning that it’s heavily influenced by environmental cues.While context-dependent memory can trigger waves of pleasant nostalgia, it can also lead to a mental block in our factual learning. If we only study or practice a skill in one place, our memories become tied to the sights, sounds and smells of that location. This makes it harder for us to recall the same material in a new environment – the exam hall, the quizshow studio, a Parisian restaurant – without those cues.After pitting your brain against all those desirable difficulties, give it time to recover. I don’t mean regular time out like watching TV, but literally doing nothing. Prof Michaela Dewar at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh has found that “wakeful rest” – without any external stimulation – allows the brain to consolidate the memories of what it has learned.So kick back, close your eyes and let your thoughts go wherever they want – in the knowledge that your mind is busy cementing your learning for the long term.• David Robson is the author of The Intelligence Trap: Revolutionise Your Thinking and Make Wiser Decisions (Hodder \u0026amp Stoughton, £9.99).

With its short boundaries and much-vaunted “thin air” SuperSport Park is a place for hitting sixes. There were 28 of them on an afternoon when cricket was transformed into a game of the skies and England chased down South Africa’s 222 in thrilling fashion.The decisive hand came from Eoin Morgan, who walked out with the third T20 international slipping away at 140 for three in the 13th over and just kept on pumping the ball over the rope. He ended on 57 not out off 22 balls with seven sixes, all but 10 of his runs scored on the leg-side as he targeted that boundary with relentless precision.At the end of a wonderfully enjoyable series England emerged 2-1 winners. This was billed as preparation for the T20 World Cup in Australia. The high-tempo brilliance of England’s batting suggests they have a chance of going far. It might also be one to watch from behind the sofa.“If I can manage to be there at the end, I’d back myself to be good enough to get guys over the line,” Morgan said of that stunning chase. “It creates belief that you can chase down anything and it reinforces what our method is in chasing big totals down. It’s a reference point to what we can do.”At the start of the day Quinton de Kock had won the toss and opted to bat. Heinrich Klaasen replaced Jon‑Jon Smuts in South Africa’s XI. Joe Denly was unwell, replaced by Dawid Malan for his first game on tour.This ground was a baking hot place in the midday sun, the grassy banks thronged like a riviera beach in August. England began with Moeen Ali from the Hennops river end. His first ball was flayed through the off-side. His fifth was lifted over mid-on. It was that kind of day already.Mark Wood saw his first ball ked over mid-off for a clean, cloudless six by De Kock, a shot simply pulled out of the air by this mind-bendingly brilliant striker of a ball.Pitches like this are often described as roads. This was something else, a four-lane super-smooth autobahn. There was almost an audible gulp from England’s bowlers as South Africa’s fifty came up in 3.4 overs.Enter Ben Stokes, who has a happy habit of taking wickets in his first over. De Kock was deceived by an off-cutter and caught at deep square-leg. Next over Adil Rashid took out Temba Bavuma for a sparkling 49 with a lovely wrong ’un that snaked in between bat and pad.At 100 for two off 10 overs Klaasen introduced himself. When in Centurion, send for a brawny-shouldered Afrikaner. Klaasen plays for the Titans here. He knows the angles, the pitch, the sounds. Early on he went straight or over midwicket. Later he bent his knees and carved behind point. He went to 50 off 25 balls, pulling a slower ball for his fourth six to get there. He was out skying Tom Curran to Stokes at mid-off for a fine hometown 66 off 33.England will perhaps regret a lack of control with the ball. Wood was wild on the highveld. His first 12 balls went for 39 runs. Only Curran looked in control of his variations. He bowled one sensational dot ball in the 17th over, a back-of-the-hand slowie that Dwaine Pretorius could only watch, watch some more, and then block.And so to England’s last batting innings of the tour, with licence to come out swinging. Jason Roy was caught early on trying to hit the ball to Lesotho. Jos Buttler looked frantic, swatting and swiping, but still picking the gaps. He got to 37 off 19 balls without seeming to find the middle once.On came South Africa’s banker Tabraiz Shamsi to bowl his hunched left-arm wrist spin. Buttler took one look and brought out the scimitar, swiping four then six. At 81 for one off seven overs England were slightly ahead.Buttler’s fifty came up with a run-down to third man, a player good enough to lead a vertiginous run chase even when he is finding his way back to form. He departed ramping one up in the air just after the hundred had come up in the ninth over. Malan walked out for his first proper bat since January and scratched about for an angsty 11. Jonny Bairstow went to a quick-fire 64 before missing a slower ball. When he plays like this there is a beautifully murderous quality to his hitting.England needed 78 off 37 balls with Stokes and Morgan at the wicket and a need to pump the throttle from a standing start. Morgan did so with breathless intent, standing coiled at the crease and hitting five of his first 15 balls for six. The chase had been cut to 33 off the last 18 balls.Andile Phehlukwayo had been hard to get away. Stokes picked his moment, twice hammering sixes over wide mid-on, the second into the car park, a ridiculous piece of hitting that turned the game decisively.Morgan pumped another six over deep midwicket’s fingertips, then lifted another miles back to go to his half-century, as good a finisher’s innings as you will see. Moeen smashed the first ball of the last over past mid-off. England had got there with legroom to spare."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9fc5b01823b09330837f873f80181ab220c3408/481_402_3209_2363/master/3209.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=87f043936dac2cdbd1b610592038b940","title":"pete buttigieg chasten rush limbaugh","story":"Pete Buttigieg is “not going to be lectured on family values from the likes of Rush Limbaugh or anybody who supports Donald J Trump as the moral as well as political leader of the United States”, the Democratic presidential contender said on Sunday.Limbaugh, a conservative talk radio host controversially honoured by Trump, caused controversy this week when he questioned whether Americans were ready to vote for a gay candidate for president.Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Buttigieg added: “America has moved on and we should have politics of belonging that welcomes everybody. That’s what the American people are for. And I am saddened for what the Republican party has become if they embrace that kind of homophobic rhetoric.”During his State of the Union address earlier this month, Trump gave Limbaugh the nation’s top civilian honour, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In liberal circles, the decision met with widespread criticism.Limbaugh, 69, who recently revealed he has advanced lung cancer, subsequently said on his radio show that if Buttigieg made the debates later this year, Americans would see a “37-year-old gay guy kissing his husband on stage, next to Mr Man, Donald Trump”.Voters, he said, would conclude that “despite all the great wokeness and despite all the great ground that’s been covered, that America’s still not ready to elect a ‘gay guy kissing his husband on the debate stage’ president”.Some Democratic voters, he added, might decide they should “get a gay guy kissing his husband on stage, ram it down Trump’s throat and beat him in the general election. Really? Having fun envisioning that.”Buttigieg – who is 38 – was initially cautious in response but the remarks were condemned by senior members of both political parties.Former vice-president Joe Biden, competing for the Democratic nomination, called Limbaugh’s comments “part of the depravity of this administration”.Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican senator and key Trump ally, said Limbaugh had made “a miscalculation as to where the country is at”.Asked if Limbaugh should retain the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Graham said: “Well, my God. Free speech still exists.”Trump also distanced himself from the remarks by his supporter and sometime onstage companion, telling a podcast that though some Americans wouldn’t vote for a gay president, “I wouldn’t be among that group, to be honest with you.”Buttigieg told Fox News Sunday that when he came out during a mayoral re-election campaign, he received more support than in his first race. He also responded to Limbaugh on CNN’s State of the Union.“I love my husband,” he said, of Chasten Buttigieg, who he married in 2018 and who like any politician’s spouse regularly appears at campaign events.“I’m faithful to my husband. Onstage we usually just go for the hug. But I love him very much and I’m not going to take lectures on family values from the likes of Rush Limbaugh.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce7e8ae17f10677d0cfb5bc39f8964521562fda1/0_328_5078_3047/master/5078.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02160ed55c14663b73125d842721021b","title":"coronavirus more than 3000 britons tested","story":"Eight of nine people who tested positive successfully treated and discharged from hospitalThe number of people tested for coronavirus in the UK has passed 3,000, according to official figures.Statistics from the Department of Health and Social Care show that 3,109 tests had been carried out in the UK as of 2pm on Sunday, an increase of 117 on the 2,992 reported on Saturday.Nine people have tested positive for the virus in the UK so far, eight of whom have since been discharged from hospital after recording two negative tests.The news came as the Sunday  reported that people with flu-like symptoms could be told by authorities to self-isolate by staying at home for a fortnight if the number of confirmed cases in the UK passes 100.The government did not comment on the report, but said official advice was under constant review as the situation developed.The UK chief medical officers are  instructing anyone experiencing a cough, fever or shortness of breath who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the past 14 days to stay indoors and call NHS 111.NHS England said on Saturday that all 94 people in quarantine at Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral had been released. The group had been kept in isolation at the hospital after returning to the UK from Wuhan in China, the centre of the outbreak.Prof Keith Willet, the NHS strategic incident director, said: “The last guests have left Arrowe Park hospital and I would once again like to thank them for the calm, patient and responsible way that they have responded to what must have been a trying situation.”The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised UK nationals to leave China where possible. It is also warning that travellers from Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand who develop symptoms of cough or fever or shortness of breath within 14 days of returning the UK should contact the NHS by phone.More than 100 people, who were evacuated later from the region, remained in isolation at the Kents Hill Park Hotel in Milton Keynes.“I am also pleased that eight of the nine iniduals who tested positive for coronavirus have now been successfully treated and discharged from hospital,” said Matt Hancock, the health secretary.“I want to stress that any iniduals who are discharged from hospital are now well and do not pose any public health risk to the public. Again, this is evidence of how well prepared our NHS is to deal with the Wuhan coronavirus.”On Saturday, an 80-year-old Chinese man in France on holiday became the first person to die from virus in Europe, and the first fatality outside Asia. The patient, who was from the province of Hubei that includes Wuhan, had arrived in France on January 16 and suffered a lung infection caused by the virus.While the death toll in mainland China has risen by 142 to 1,665, the country’s authorities also reported the number of new cases has fallen for the third straight day to 2,009."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a9055ce572ac925f25bacbb3834a68f9be43d44/0_222_12046_7230/master/12046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3996ecbfa4bc031c83d079271a43e7cd","title":"israeli group plan burning man like event in occupied west bank","story":"PLO secretary general criticises invitation for Palestinians to attend as insultingA plan by an Israeli group to hold a Burning Man-style event in the deserts of the occupied territories has sparked frustration among Palestinians and dismay from Israeli festival enthusiasts who say it goes against the original event’s founding principles.The annual gathering in the Nevada desert in the US, with its massive art installations, costumes and symbolic burning of an effigy of “The Man”, has gathered a global following.In Israel, its official partner, Midburn – which combines the Hebrew word for desert, “midbar”, with “burn” – has been running events, or “burns”, since 2014. But since the group had trouble finding a location in Israeli deserts, several “burners” broke away to form their own, unofficial festival.Organisers say the Dead Sea Burn event has already received approval by Israel’s military for up to 15,000 people to assemble on land near the border with Jordan, the Dead Sea and the Palestinian city of Jericho. It will still need Israeli police permissions before it can go ahead in April.Yaron Ben Shoshan, who is a joint-lead on the project, says he has been pushing for Palestinians to attend and argues his efforts are not political, although he understands why people would see it that way.“The bad side is fighting about the area and arguing with each other and making the gap deeper. The other way of reacting is to say, ‘we have an opportunity here to show our leaders that we as people can communicate and enjoy ourselves together’.”However, the military has far more restrictive rules for Palestinians who live in the area than it does for Israelis. West Bank Palestinians who would like to attend need first to secure permission from the Israeli army, organisers say. The location at which the event is scheduled to take place belongs to a territory claimed by Israeli settlements, which are often built on land taken from Palestinians. Local Palestinian residents and authorities were not consulted. has contacted the Israeli military for comment.Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), who is also from Jericho, said the invitation to Palestinians to attend was “an insulting statement that unveils the colonialist mentality of the organisers”.“So they come to occupied territory, to an area where the occupation negates Palestinian development through a network of checkpoints, roadblocks and closed military zones, where our natural resources are stolen and our rights in general are negated, and then they tell us ‘you can attend’ in a closed military area.”Mohammed al Tamari, a Palestinian farmer who lives near the proposed site, said organisers should have known better.The festival, he said, would serve only to promote plans by the Israeli government, supported by the Trump administration, to declare the wider area, which comprises up to a third of the West Bank, as part of Israel – a move many states see as an illegal land-grab.“This is Palestinian land. They have no right in it,” said al Tamari. “And why don’t they ask for permission? They ignore us deliberately.”Burning Man’s Israeli partner, Midburn, has made it clear it is not associated with the proposed festival. In 2016, the group looked at the opportunity to hold a gathering in the same spot but decided against it to uphold its apolitical stance.The plan has also led to heated debate in the Israeli festival community as many “burners” argue it goes against the 10 founding principles of Burning Man, including civic responsibility, communal effort and radical inclusion.“Clearly ‘radical inclusion’ cannot be upheld at this burn, as it excludes members of our own community who will not attend out of political discomfort, not to mention the Palestinian population who will not be permitted to attend,” said Danna Colin, a Tel Aviv-based designer who is one of the heads of the Midburn art department. “A burn is a burn because of its values. That’s what separates it from any other festival.”That Midburn has managed to thrive in Israel while staying out of politics, she said, was nothing short of a miracle. “With this one sweeping move, it’s so easily damaged,” she added.Additional reporting by Sufian Taha"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68fb76a7c1d0eaea2c534786c1958edd529be142/2487_19_1315_789/master/1315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d15a1520fa87b47161d8d7c6375e3d9c","title":"stressed heads to start brussels budget talks post brexit","story":"Presidents, prime ministers and chancellors across Europe will pack their bags later this week in preparation for a long weekend in Brussels. They won’t, however, be taking in the baroque majesty of the Grand Place or savouring the local culinary treats. Instead, they will be preparing for that most infamous of events, a “four shirter”, to use the clothes-packing gauge adopted by male diplomats to measure the length and horror of EU leaders’ summits in the Belgian capital. The thorny subject this time around? Money. And the problem? Britain.The UK’s withdrawal from the European Union has left a huge €75bn (£62bn) hole in the bloc’s budget for the next seven years, 2021 to 2027. “And now we are fighting like ferrets in a sack,” said one EU diplomat with a sigh.Covering items ranging from agricultural subsidies to science programmes and the EU’s efforts to combat the climate emergency, the new multi-annual financial framework (MFF) needs to be agreed by the leaders and an increasingly unpredictable European parliament before the end of the year. Without agreement, everything risks grinding to a halt in just nine months’ time, including the flow of cohesion funds, the cash dedicated to supporting the poorest member states.Budget discussions in Brussels are always rancorous affairs. But this one is of a different order: everyone will have to pay more. No one wants to. EU capitals are bristling for a fight when they come to Brussels on Thursday for day one. Ominously for the diplomatic corps, an end date for the summit has not been fixed, but four days of talking are on the cards.Then there are the “Friends of Cohesion”. “The Friends of Corruption, you mean?” spat one EU diplomat from a Frugal state.The 15 under the FoC flag are the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Estonia, Croatia, Malta, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania, Portugal and Greece.The Frugals say that the commission’s €90bn in cuts to agriculture and cohesion funding are not enough. The FoC say they are being unfairly targeted and that the richer countries should cough up some more, setting up a battle between east and west.The debate is all the more toxic as the commission has proposed that cohesion funds should also, in the future, be conditional on member states respecting the rule of law. It is a red rag to the bulls in the nationalist governments of Hungary and Poland, who are already in a battle with Brussels over their judicial reforms, among other issues.Then there is France and Germany. Berlin’s main concern is that they don’t come out of it looking worse than the French. In Paris, the government just worries about how much cash is going to go to its farmers, said one senior EU official. The fragmentation of the national debates leaves it impossible to say what will happen, said a second official, with even Irish politics in turmoil following the election that has made Sinn Féin the second largest parliamentary party.Going in to the summit, the European council’s president, Charles Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium, has been engaged in furious shuttle diplomacy around the capitals.“In this negotiation, we are not expecting member states to be happy, but the degree of dissatisfaction will be key,” said a senior EU official. “No chance,” responded a Frugal diplomat. “There is not a lot to say, except we won’t pay. And as the Rolling Stones song goes, ‘Time is on my side’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ff8657d85ec51f06854c65071a598dbe8befad6/0_346_5004_3002/master/5004.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a70e4ed6ff5e910e2fcb2be09e02b8c7","title":"westlessness is the west really in a state of peril","story":"Top diplomats disagreed over the global relevance of the west at the Munich security conferenceThe chosen theme of the Munich security conference – once a party for Nato and now a Davos for the world’s diplomats – was “westlessness”. The organisers wanted to capture the fear that the west is now so ided and challenged by the rise of China its whole existence has become imperilled.It was not a concept that won universal acclaim. Margrethe Vestager, the EU vice-president, hit back in one session: “I never thought about ’westlessness’ before. Are we here discussing our own depression and asking the rest of the world to join in as a sort of collective mindfulness exercise? I don’t really don’t get this.” European values – the rule of law and the integrity of the inidual – had spread across the world, she insisted.Similarly the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, refused to succumb to defeatism, pointing out that when refugees flee their chosen destination is normally Europe.But there was no denying the mood of angst that prevailed in the conference hall, and the sense that new centres of disruptive decision making were emerging to which the west, and especially Europe, were too slow to adapt.Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister, said the future of the Middle East was no longer being decided in Geneva and New York, the residencies of the UN, but instead in Astana and Sochi, the cities where Russia, Turkey and Iran meet. The cause he said was the White House decision no longer to play the role of omnipresent policeman. The US departure left what Maas described as “geostrategic gaps”, and these were being filled by countries whose values Europe did not share. All this required Germany to answer Emmanuel Macron’s call for a strategic dialogue, especially on defence.So when Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, proclaimed in his optimistic conference speech “we are winning”, the largely European audience was silent and worried in what sense “we” existed any longer.For despite the large US presence at the conference – more than 40 congressmen and women from both sides of the political ide travelled across the Atlantic to attend – the predominant administration message to Europe was to fall into line on Iran, Nato defence spending, trade and above all Huawei, described by the US defence secretary, Mark Esper, as the poster boy of Chinese predatory economics. Huawei dominated many debates.Indeed, veteran MSC watcher Ian Bremmer, founder of the Eurasia group, said: “I have never been to one of these conferences in which Europe and the US had been so ided over an issue of national security.”Both Esper and Pompeo, he said, saw Europe’s decision to give Huawei access to their 5G networks not as a nuanced commercial decision, but as an existential threat to the western world order.Esper certainly did not hold back, saying: “Huawei and 5G is a textbook example of the China’s strategy to destabilise and to dominate. Dependence on it can make our partners’ digital systems vulnerable and make it difficult to share information with our partners. It can undermine Nato, the most successful alliance in history.”According to Esper, it also took the US a few years to understand this threat. “Maybe Europe is a little behind in this.”When asked by former Estonian president Toomas Ilves what alternatives were available to Europe, Esper simply replied “that is a good question”. The laughter revealed he did not yet have a good answer.“We definitely have to develop an alternative,” said Esper in acknowledgment. The US does not like picking winners, but Esper revealed he has already given Nokia and Ericsson technicians security clearances to work with the US defence to develop a strong competitor to Huawei.But in the meantime, Europe, including the UK, finds itself in a mincer between the US and China. The US senator Lindsey Graham, an ally of Donald Trump, singled out the UK for criticism saying it would be burning bridges if it chose Huawei. Politics back home he said was “pretty screwed up”, but Huawei was the one issue on which the president and Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat leader of Congress agree. Pelosi underlined the bipartisanship saying the decision on 5G networks represented a choice between democracy and autocracy.Yet the Chinese will be furious if they feel Europe has succumbed to US bullying. Fu Ying a senior member of China’s top legislature and former diplomat, asked Pelosi “Do you really think the democratic system is so fragile that it could be threatened by a single high tech company?”.Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, complained that Esper and Pompeo say the same thing about China wherever they go and dismissed their remarks as lies: “The root cause of all these problems and issues is that the US does not want to see the rapid development and rejuvenation of China, and still less would they want to accept the success of a socialist country.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4175763.1581888716!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"boil water notice affecting 6 500 people issued in co cork","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA boil water notice has been issues for the area supplied by the Whitegate Regional Public Water Supply.

The company’s lines include Kingsmill, Burgen and Sunblest. Tha action “brought production on he site to a grinding halt... Management were left in no doubt about the strength of workers’ resolution to win a fair pay increase,” Susan Fitzgerald of Unite said. “As a direct result of this powerful and effective strike action which saw delivery vehicles forced to reverse after hours of unsuccessful attempts at passing pickets, an improved pay offer was made,” she said on Sunday. PreparationsA picket began at the Allied Bakeries site on the Castlereagh Road at 6am on Sunday and the union said the aim was to disrupt the company’s preparations for Pancake Tuesday on February 25th. Allied Bakeries said it was proud of its reputation “as a long-term and stable employer in the community” and that they were disappointed about the industrial action. “We have increased our rates of pay every year for the past 10 years and will do so again this year,” it said earlier.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe .Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty has said that she is retiring from electoral politics.Ms Doherty was one of a number of high profile female casualties of last weekend’s general election. Others included Minister for Children Katherine Zappone, who is also retiring, as is former minister and Labour TD Jan O’Sullivan.However, Fianna Fáil’s Lisa Chambers, who also lost her Dáil seat, said she would like to continue in politics as she feels as if she is “only getting started”.The four women were guests on RTÉ Radio’s Sunday with Miriam programme and all spoke of the abuse they received in their political careers, which they felt was more personalised because they were women.Ms Chambers described it as “based on the tone of your voice, the colour of your hair, your dress”.The former Mayo TD is expecting her first child and said “that was coming up as well. ‘Oh she’s taking maternity leave so there’s no point electing her.’”She said a different standard was applied to female politicians which meant that “you have to be so careful about how you come across”.“Being assertive for a woman is often being bossy or aggressive or whiney,” she said.Ms Chambers suggested the best way to deal with the problem was to talk more about it and to elect more women to politics.Ms Doherty said male politicians “get loads of abuse” but that the vitriol saved for female politicians was “very personal”.“If I had a euro for every time I’ve been called the C word in the last month...,” she said.Seanad runThe former Fine Gael TD for Meath East, whose seniority in the party could have led her to expect a party nomination to run for the Seanad, said she had no regrets about her decision.She said her time in politics had been “a wonderful 10 years and what I would hate to do is to spend the next couple of years chasing something that might have been”.“I’m only a young one in my head so I think I’ve something left to give. I don’t know what that is yet,” she said.Acknowledging the impact of her political career on family life, Ms Doherty said: “I’ve four lovely kids, a great husband, a really good marriage, a mam and dad who live around the corner from me, a new little niece.“There’s loads of stuff that I’ve been neglecting because you’re so busy on this treadmill, running forward all the time. I just want to have some time for me and see what’s next.”Senior Fianna Fáil sources said this week that Ms Chambers would be prioritised to run for the Seanad to keep her in political life. Ms Chambers said she spent two years on the local council and four years in the Dáil “so it was a short enough stint in electoral politics”.She said: “I feel like I have more to do. I don’t know what that is exactly I’m certainly not going to close the door on it this week.”‘Wonderful years’Ms Zappone said she felt sadness at losing her Dáil seat in Dublin South-West but insisted that she had “nine wonderful years in Irish political life”.“Every single moment, especially being a Minister, was a privilege as well as an opportunity. I feel that’s completed now. I’m ready to move on. I’ve other ambitions and hopes.”Ms O’Sullivan said she’d had 21 years as a TD and “it was a disappointment losing the seat but as I look to the future there is a sense of relief”.She said she would be active in a different political role in helping to rebuild the Labour Party, which now has only six Dáil seats.She said her political career had come “full circle” as her first election was in 1983 trying to prevent the Eighth Amendment being written in to the Constitution.She noted that herself, Ms Chambers, former Fine Gael TD Kate O’Connell and former Solidarity TD Ruth Coppinger were all on the Oireachtas committee dealing with the Eighth Amendment and “we all lost our seats”.“Doing what you need to do as a legislator and what you’re passionate about is why you’re there in the first place and at the same time winning your seat is not always an easy balance to get right,” said Ms O’Sullivan.All four women said when they lost their seats they were concerned too that the people who worked with them would also lose their jobs.Ms O’Sullivan said that because she was out all the time canvassing with a team of people, the seat loss felt like “a communal experience”.Ms Chambers said of her family and political team: “They’re devastated for you but equally you’re devastated for them. They’ve put as much into it as you have.“You feel almost like you’ve let everyone else down.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph: Damien EagersThe .  A Fine Gael Minister of State has accused Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald of “giving up” on government formation talks.Minister of State for Housing Damien English said he believes the numbers are available to allow Sinn Féin to try to form a left-leaning administration.This is despite senior Sinn Féin figures such as Eoin Ó Broin saying they do not think it is possible for the party to form a Government without the support of Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.Sinn Féin seized the early post-election initiative, after winning an additional 14 seats and the largest share of the vote, by reaching out to other groups in an attempt to form a left-leaning government. Ms McDonald has said her preference would be to form a government without Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, but Mr Ó Broin said late last week that such an arrangement would not be workable. “Fine Gael are very clear on this, Sinn Féin did secure the most votes, Fianna Fáil the most seats,” Mr English said on RTÉ’s This Week programme. “We assumed from listening to Mary Lou earlier in the week that she was going to attempt to form the left-wing government...I personally find it strange that she has given up on that already.“Generally to form a government it does take a bit of effort and time. I am surprised that after three or four days they have given up on that. I think the numbers are there with the support of independents.”He said that Fine Gael would meet on Monday to discuss the future direction of the party.Meanwhile, the Green Party is seeking to hold talks with other political parties on how a new government could deliver on the issues of housing, healthcare and combating climate change. AgreementIt said Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Social Democrats would be invited to bilateral meetings between February 21st and February 29th to discuss the policy areas in an attempt to get clarity on “points of agreement and difference with each party”. “There is broad agreement among a variety of parties that any new government has to deliver on housing, health care and climate action but no discussion yet on how these changes should be made,” Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said in a statement on Sunday.“We are doing what we said on the election campaign, talking to each party equally, respecting their mandate but insisting that any new government has to be fully clear on how we meet the big challenges we face.”The Green Party won 12 seats in last week’s general election, which saw no party have more than 38 TDs elected, and it has been regularly mentioned as a potential part of a coalition government. Reports on Sunday suggest Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are to enter talks in the coming days on forming a grand coalition, which would need the support of a third party such as the Greens to have a majority in the Dáil. OppositionHowever, some in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are opposed to the old rivals pairing up and would favour a period in opposition given both lost seats in the election which followed the conclusion of a confidence-and-supply arrangement between the two during the last Dáil. Ms McDonald on Saturday accused Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin of arrogance for saying he would not enter coalition with her party due to concerns about Sinn Féin’s approach to the economy and its democratic credentials. In his statement on Sunday, Mr Ryan said the Greens would be asking the other parties six main questions: How do we meet our climate and bioersity targets? How do we address the housing crisis? What are the immediate priorities in implementing Slaintecare? How do we fund the necessary increase in public services? What are the all-island, Brexit, and European dimensions to the changes we seek? How do we support better community development as we improve public services?“Invitations will be sent to other parties on Monday and we will engage with them in advance of each meeting to agree on the terms of reference and approach for each event,” the Green Party said.

It was a heart-wrenching commentTo me, the most shocking thing about learning that Caroline Flack had taken her own life is that I was not actually shocked.My job for more than two decades has involved being around celebrities, interviewing them for magazines. I have also spent a year living in Los Angeles with Spice Girl, Melanie Brown, writing what would become her best-selling autobiography, Brutally Honest. You get to see the sparkling high-octane glamour of these rare, idolised creatures, but you also witness the swirling insecurities, the painful fallibilities and the relentless fear and pressure that lies beneath that facade. I first met Caroline in 2009 and interviewed her on multiple occasions in subsequent years. Caroline was one of those girls who hadn’t read the rule book on being the perfect celebrity. She went out a lot, she partied, she dated the wrong men. That first meeting came shortly after a series of scandalous liaisons with Prince Harry the next time I sat down with her it was after she had split from the 17-year-old Harry Styles (she was 31 at the time). And there were many disastrous choices after the two Harrys. But all this kept her in the news, made her a hot property because she was relatable to all other women struggling to find happiness hence, she was the perfect choice in 2015 for Love Island. “People love it when they see I’m a mess because it makes them feel better,” she once told me. It was a heart-wrenching comment, not simply because it was true but because, as she delivered the words, I could see the flicker of pain and confusion in her eyes. It was also moving because she understood that the more of a mess she was the greater her success became. She never understood how important it was to separate that image from who she really was. TV presenter Caroline Flack has died at the age of 40Caroline never wanted to be a mess. She desperately wanted you to like her when you met her. She wanted to be good at her job (there are few presenters who invested more time and energy that she did into Love Island even giving most of the contestants her mobile phone number). And she wanted to be happy. The closest person in her life – except for her boyfriend Lewis Burton – was her twin sister Jody, who lives in the countryside with her husband and three young children. Caroline worried about getting too old to have children. She worried about upsetting her family. She worried about how she was viewed by her peers. “I know I’m so lucky to have this life, I just always want to prove I’m worth it,” she said. As a kid, and from playing the front end of a panto horse (her twin Jody was at the back), Caroline knew she wanted to be famous. Like millions of others she believed that fame would bring complete happiness. By her mid-twenties she had a career in television and in her thirties, she was a bona-fide celebrity stacking up all those amazing Instagram shots on yachts in bikinis and at fabulous parties. Caroline Flack in a promotional shot for Love Island which she presented for five seasons But she freely admitted she would Google herself and read horrific messages on her social media accounts. “I can’t stop myself,” she said. “And then I just cry.” Such is the see-saw of fame. And Caroline learnt that fame does not guarantee happiness. It is a breeding ground for your insecurities to swell and leave you beset with a constant fear you are not pretty enough, good enough, talented enough or stable enough. From great heights come crashing depths. I know that – along with the bad guys - she did also have some very good people around her.  But the focus is only on you. Losing her job, and facing the humiliation of a court case was something she was neither mentally or emotionally able to deal with. British art critic who cast doubt on Russian works wins defamation caseCoronavirus latest news: UK cruise passengers to remain quarantined in Japan despite calls for helpComment: The people\u0026#39s government should not be attacking the broadcaster the people loveComment: How can the governing classes be so naive about the threats we face?Facebook unwittingly enticing people to sign up with pornographic imagesDementia sufferers dumped in hospitals after mass closures of day centres and respite care Conservative party risks losing voters if it continues \u0026#39vendetta\u0026#39 against the BBC, senior Tories warnStorm Dennis leaves a trail of devastation - just one week after Storm CiaraCoronavirus: Britons on infected Diamond Princess cruise may get quarantined in Japan instead of being flown back to UKBoris Johnson told to sack new aide amid Conservative backlash over controversial remarksStorm Dennis latest news: \u0026#39Life-threatening\u0026#39 situation as major incident declared in South WalesEnvironment Secretary says \u0026#39We\u0026#39ll never be able to protect every household\u0026#39 following record flood warnings Ski runs close in France as workers go on strike over pension reforms German police arrest 12 members of far-Right terrorist cell plotting \u0026#39civil war\u0026#39 Ousted leader of Thuringia ready to make concessions to Angela Merkel\u0026#39s CDUActor Martin Freeman admits he smacks his kids when he is \u0026#39impatient and at the end of his rope\u0026#39Comment: Domestic abuse affects us all - and we need to do more to break the silence that surrounds victimsCaroline Flack: Crown Prosecution Service under fire for \u0026#39dogged pursuit\u0026#39 of TV star over domestic abuse charges Jeremy Corbyn should return to frontline politics as Labour\u0026#39s shadow foreign secretary, deputy candidate suggestsComment: Keep your hat on, Lord Fowler – a fetching titfer is the ultimate fashion accessoryKnives out for Mike Bloomberg as billionaire makes presence felt in Democratic raceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/02/06/TELEMMGLPICT000223160677_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNtm3NAjPW-2_OvjCiS6COCU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"dont have regrets","story":"I could have done things better sometimes, but regret seems like a weird sort of gloatingOne of the best things about being a sociopath is that you don’t get upset about being called a sociopath, whereas fat people hate being called fat and daft people hate being called daft. We just tend to smirk in a superior style, and if we’re feeling particularly cute we have a bit of a simper – pinky finger to lips, à la Dr Evil.I’ve been called one so often, by various vexed husbands, that I rarely think about what it means any more. But if I had to sum up what does make me different from a lot of people, it’s that there are certain emotions which many lay claim to that literally have no meaning for me. Some of them sound vaguely attractive, like sleazy Seventies scents – Scruples, Shame – but others sound like silly Victorian paintings designed to make women feel bad about not being wet. Guilt would be one – and, of course, Regret.This week, a survey of 2,000 people (carried out in partnership with KP Nuts) claimed that the average citizen of our sceptred isle spends a whopping 110 hours a year – 500 waking days over a lifetime – lost in regret for what might have been 57 per cent wish they’d chosen another career path a quarter pine for lost loves. Sadly, there were no statistics as to what proportion of people regret eating that innocent‑looking packet of KP Nuts before reading how many calories they contain, which is one of the few instances of remorse I can totally identify with.A certain amount of regret is meant to be an essential part of the well-curated modern personality when we hear songs from the pre‑woke world, such as My Way (“Regrets, I’ve had a few – but then again too few to mention”) or Je Ne Regrette Rien (“No, nothing, I don’t regret anything  It’s paid, I don’t care!”), we’re meant to flaunt our emotional intelligence by reframing them through the prism of narcissism and decrying the boasters as sociopaths like me. It’s considered far more healthy and human to mope about what might have been – just see Nick Hornby’s whole career and the website Friends Reunited.Obviously, as a hardcore optimist, I’m going to be opposed to it, but regret strikes me as an inherently dishonest emotion phoney and performative, like being “wistful” or “vibrant” – another two things I doubt people do without an audience.I’m not suggesting that everyone should become a sociopath, but I believe that you self-identifying Nice Folk could learn something from us. Yes, I’ve behaved badly – yes, many times I could have done things better. But to go around actively regretting my wicked ways would seem like a weird sort of gloating.Then there’s my suspicion that regret is a kind of laziness that lets us off the hook by saying “It’s too late to write that bookhave that bodysee that world.” I doubt if the people surveyed were on their actual deathbeds if they’d made an effort, they could still change track. But how much easier to sit there in the same old rut moaning “If only…”For others, regret is a conceit “O, I could have done so much more!” What makes you think that? Maybe what you’ve done is all you could have done most of those who thought that if they’d made a different choice they’d be happier, richer or doing their dream job are probably deluded.Regret would be irritating enough if only expressed by iniduals – who at least one can steer clear of – but it can drive political movements and blight cultures. Thus pockets of privileged Westerners – often students – demand that the West ceaselessly makes a show of collective regret over slavery while turning a blind eye to the Africans complicit in it and the Arab states that still indulge in it.Much of the inability of Remainers to move on and seek closure is down to the fact they want nothing more than mass regret from us reckless Brexiteers a full-on what-have-we-done rending of garments while bearing the European flag through the streets of our ruined cities and sobbing out the Ode to Joy.But it’s worth bearing in mind that 79 per cent of people in the peanut poll believed they’d have been far happier if they’d taken more risks. So no Brexit Regret, thank you, we’re not skittish.British art critic who cast doubt on Russian works wins defamation caseCoronavirus latest news: UK cruise passengers to remain quarantined in Japan despite calls for helpComment: The people\u0026#39s government should not be attacking the broadcaster the people loveComment: How can the governing classes be so naive about the threats we face?Facebook unwittingly enticing people to sign up with pornographic imagesComment: Caroline Flack always worried that she wasn\u0026#39t worthyDementia sufferers dumped in hospitals after mass closures of day centres and respite care Conservative party risks losing voters if it continues \u0026#39vendetta\u0026#39 against the BBC, senior Tories warnStorm Dennis leaves a trail of devastation - just one week after Storm CiaraCoronavirus: Britons on infected Diamond Princess cruise may get quarantined in Japan instead of being flown back to UKBoris Johnson told to sack new aide amid Conservative backlash over controversial remarksStorm Dennis latest news: \u0026#39Life-threatening\u0026#39 situation as major incident declared in South WalesEnvironment Secretary says \u0026#39We\u0026#39ll never be able to protect every household\u0026#39 following record flood warnings Ski runs close in France as workers go on strike over pension reforms German police arrest 12 members of far-Right terrorist cell plotting \u0026#39civil war\u0026#39 Ousted leader of Thuringia ready to make concessions to Angela Merkel\u0026#39s CDUActor Martin Freeman admits he smacks his kids when he is \u0026#39impatient and at the end of his rope\u0026#39Comment: Domestic abuse affects us all - and we need to do more to break the silence that surrounds victimsCaroline Flack: Crown Prosecution Service under fire for \u0026#39dogged pursuit\u0026#39 of TV star over domestic abuse charges Jeremy Corbyn should return to frontline politics as Labour\u0026#39s shadow foreign secretary, deputy candidate suggestsComment: Keep your hat on, Lord Fowler – a fetching titfer is the ultimate fashion accessoryWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/01/TELEMMGLPICT000211598551_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqv3hxuICTza90rxjOncu1SK8fQrJGiSc0wsot5slw59Q.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"overtly political judges long overdue moment reckoning","story":"Attorney General Suella Braverman must be prepared to argue for judicial reform, or the only alternative is to subject members of the Supreme Court to US-style hearings by politicians before their appointmentThe Government has been squaring up for a fight with the judiciary since what history may come to call the Prorogation Crisis of 2019 and the replacement of Geoffrey Cox by Suella Braverman as Attorney General in last week’s reshuffle seems certain to launch hostilities.Weeks before her appointment Mrs Braverman said it was time for Parliament to get back “power ceded to the courts”, and that “repatriated powers from the EU will mean precious little if our courts continue to act as political decision-maker, pronouncing on what the law ought to be and supplanting Parliament.” Were that not enough fighting talk, she continued: “Traditionally, parliament made the law and judges applied it. But today, our courts exercise a form of political power.”One has only to study the Prorogation Crisis to understand that Mrs Braverman has a point.The Supreme Court’s decision that the prorogation of Parliament was a justiciable matter ided not just the country but the legal profession. To many, it seemed that the law had become yet another of our supposedly disinterested institutions – along with the Speakership of the House of Commons – made so over-wrought by the democratic decision for Britain to leave the European Union that it would interpret the rules of the game not just to the limit, but possibly beyond it, to try to prevent that departure.It is not fanciful to suggest that an element of public outrage at this legal interference with the elected government made a contribution to the result of the general election two months later. As such, it is inevitable that the Government should use its current strength to try to redress the balance towards the representatives of the people.It is easy to see why the Supreme Court went to the lengths it did. The last parliament sat mostly during the rule of a prime minister for whom deciding even what to have for breakfast threatened to occasion a nervous breakdown. The government over which she attempted to preside was the most ineffectual, dysfunctional and chaotic in living memory, and possibly since the 18th century.Lord Sumption, formerly of the Supreme Court, implied in his Reith Lectures last year that one reason for the courts taking more upon themselves was that the quality of government decision-making had become so poor. The Supreme Court, like Nature, seems to abhor a vacuum, and duly and incrementally stepped in.However, once the leadership changed last July, and the Government started to act decisively to move the Brexit process along, the Supreme Court seemed not much to like that either.The punishment of the government in forcing them to recall parliament seemed to assert the rights of unelected judges over elected politicians. This, in turn, excited much speculation about the political leanings of the members of the court. A trawl through their biographies provided little evidence that any of them was likely to have voted to leave the EU the pleasure one or two of them visibly took in the outcome of the court case seemed to confirm the matter.England and Wales’s independent judiciary is not only prized, but is essential to a civilised democracy. But if it is going to act in a fashion that raises doubts about its independence, then steps must be taken to stop it. The judicial reforms of the Blair years that established the Supreme Court out of the old Judicial Committee of the House of Lords should be reversed.They were engaged in largely to force Lord Irvine of Lairg off the Woolsack a preposterous reason to alter one of the cornerstone of the constitution. Similarly, the Lord Chancellor should once more be a peer, sitting in the House of Lords, and part of the judiciary. Would the old House of Lords committee, with the Lord Chancellor and a member of the elected government part of it, have taken the decision the Supreme Court took last autumn? I doubt it.If Mrs Braverman is not prepared to argue for such a reform – though it is hard to see why she should not – then the only alternative is to subject members of the Supreme Court to US-style hearings by politicians before their appointment. It would go against all precedent, but if it came about it would be something the judges had brought upon themselves.The Supreme Court itself was a lamentable departure from tradition but if it is determined to go against the interests of democracy, it may have to prepare itself for another one.Law and orderBritish art critic who cast doubt on Russian works wins defamation caseCoronavirus latest news: UK cruise passengers to remain quarantined in Japan despite calls for helpComment: The people\u0026#39s government should not be attacking the broadcaster the people loveComment: How can the governing classes be so naive about the threats we face?Facebook unwittingly enticing people to sign up with pornographic imagesComment: Caroline Flack always worried that she wasn\u0026#39t worthyDementia sufferers dumped in hospitals after mass closures of day centres and respite care Conservative party risks losing voters if it continues \u0026#39vendetta\u0026#39 against the BBC, senior Tories warnStorm Dennis leaves a trail of devastation - just one week after Storm CiaraCoronavirus: Britons on infected Diamond Princess cruise may get quarantined in Japan instead of being flown back to UKBoris Johnson told to sack new aide amid Conservative backlash over controversial remarksStorm Dennis latest news: \u0026#39Life-threatening\u0026#39 situation as major incident declared in South WalesEnvironment Secretary says \u0026#39We\u0026#39ll never be able to protect every household\u0026#39 following record flood warnings Ski runs close in France as workers go on strike over pension reforms German police arrest 12 members of far-Right terrorist cell plotting \u0026#39civil war\u0026#39 Ousted leader of Thuringia ready to make concessions to Angela Merkel\u0026#39s CDUActor Martin Freeman admits he smacks his kids when he is \u0026#39impatient and at the end of his rope\u0026#39Comment: Domestic abuse affects us all - and we need to do more to break the silence that surrounds victimsCaroline Flack: Crown Prosecution Service under fire for \u0026#39dogged pursuit\u0026#39 of TV star over domestic abuse charges Jeremy Corbyn should return to frontline politics as Labour\u0026#39s shadow foreign secretary, deputy candidate suggestsComment: Keep your hat on, Lord Fowler – a fetching titfer is the ultimate fashion accessoryWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/14/12/BP-oil-rig.jpg","title":"climate change greenwashing bp net zero 2050 advertising","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.BP’s aim of achieving net zero emissions has rightly been criticised for lacking substance, but its commitment to stop misleading adverts about its impact on the climate is a welcome start – it must be held to account on this, writes Ben ChapmanBuried a couple of thousand words beneath BP’s eye-catching announcement that it aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 was an important promise that garnered much less attention.The oil company said it would stop funding “corporate reputation advertising” which, in the context of the oil and gas industry, is more commonly known as greenwash.This means BP will end its multimillion-pound “Possibilities Everywhere” campaign, which touted the company’s questionable green credentials. That’s a fairly rapid u-turn, given that the global campaign was only launched last year.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesPerhaps BP has realised the futility of spending large sums highlighting the tiny part of its business that generates renewable energy when the company remains synonymous with fossil fuels.\u0026nbspAdverts on billboards, newspapers and television in the UK, US and Europe as well as on social media and online\u0026nbsppictured\u0026nbspgreen fields and windmills alongside phrases like, “working to make energy cleaner”. The ads missed out the fact that\u0026nbsp96 per cent of BP’s capital expenditure is on oil and gas.Thanks in part to the efforts of groups like environmental lawyers ClientEarth which launched a complaint against over the campaign, the company has been held to account.Two decades – and billions of barrels of oil – since BP had the chutzpah to relaunch itself as “beyond petroleum”, people have seen through the facade.“In future, any corporate advertising will be to push for progressive climate policy communicate our net zero ambition invite ideas or build collaboration,” BP said.This statement, unlike the target to go carbon neutral by 2050, can be scrutinised immediately and it will be. I will be closely watching BP’s public statements on climate change this year, as well as its advertising and involvement with groups like the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, to check that they measure up.We can all play a part in this too. Earlier this month Ryanair was banned from claiming that it was Europe’s “lowest CO2 emissions airline”. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the statement couldn’t be backed up.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

BP sets target to achieve net zero by 2050 to tackle climate emergencyThe climate crisis is real, but Boris Johnson still ‘doesn’t get it’Boris Johnson forces out UK president of climate change summitAnyone can make a complaint to the ASA about an issue like an misleading environmental claim, it just requires filling out a few boxes on an online form.If this action does not stop airlines and oil companies producing dodgy ads on climate change, sterner laws must be enforced. ClientEarth’s suggestion that fossil fuel adverts should be banned unless they have a tobacco-style health warning need to be\u0026nbspconsidered.A fossil fuel company portraying itself as good for the climate is no less ridiculous, or dangerous, than the tobacco companies that in the 1950s pushed cigarettes with recommendations from friendly-looking doctors.Companies that create misleading adverts about climate change need to face the prospect of fines, not just damage to their\u0026nbspreputation. Currently the ASA, is self-funded by advertisers themselves and can only ban particular promotions, often months after they’ve\u0026nbspgone out.While advertising is an important way that large greenhouse gas emitters can use their financial clout to shift the debate in their favour, a more significant front on the climate change\u0026nbspinformation war\u0026nbspis political lobbying.Here too, BP has laid down a marker by which it can be judged not in 10 years or 20 years, but almost immediately.\u0026nbspThe company laid out a less aggressive approach to lobbying, stating that it would “set new expectations” for its relationships with oil industry trade associations. Where those influential groups are pushing for policies that don’t align with BP’s new approach, it will leave.Created with Sketch.Youth Strike for Climate: London protest in photos Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Basically, this is an admission that BP’s net-zero ambition simply has no credibility if the company remains a member of powerful lobby groups like the American Petroleum Institute which has for decades funded climate change denial in a successful effort to cast doubt on the scientific consensus. BP either has to fundamentally change the API or leave it.The impact of a big oil industry player changing tack could be considerable but action needs to follow words. I’ll also be scrutinising other large oil industry firms about whether they will follow BP in “advocating for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing”.Fossil fuel lobbyists have vast budgets that allow\u0026nbspthem\u0026nbspto shift public policy and discussion significantly towards the industry’s own interests over and above those of everyone else.In any case, oil companies\u0026nbsplike formerly state-owned BP have frequently been pushing on open doors in the corridors of power. Seen by\u0026nbsppoliticians\u0026nbspto be of strategic national importance, oil majors have provided\u0026nbspthe vital commodity that fuels economic growth and\u0026nbspdelivers votes.It’s fair to say the oil majors have frequently enjoyed a cosy relationship with governments sympathetic to their aims.\u0026nbspVast budgets to fund misinformation and dodgy science have been key to prolonging the life of fossil fuel industry decades after oil companies knew climate change was dangerous and man-made.\u0026nbspClimate campaigners, who have enjoyed less privileged access to political decision-makers, have therefore been fighting a hugely asymmetric battle but one which they may now finally be starting to win.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But it is a way you can achieve positive changeInvesting in trackers means you have to take the rough with the smooth, hitching your wagon to oil companies and natural resource outfits if they\u0027re in the index you\u0027re tracking. The\u0026nbspFTSE\u0026nbsp100 has a lot of those\u0026nbspInvestment funds that aim to follow or “track” the performance of a designated stock market index, as opposed to trying to beat it, are inexpensive, easy to understand and hugely popular, especially amongst novice investors.\u0026nbspWith good reason. Most of the time they outperform so called actively managed funds run by stock pickers which too rarely beat the markets they\u0027re benchmarked against after their higher costs are factored in.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut trackers pose a problem for people who are concerned enough about the climate crisis to want to green up their investments.\u0026nbspA tracker investor\u0026nbspis inevitably exposed to most, or all, of the constituents of the index their chosen fund tracks. So they have to take the rough with the smooth. Sometimes the rough is very rough indeed from the perspective of planet earth.Britain’s premier stock market index is, for example, chock full of natural resource companies. They are some of FTSE 100\u0027s biggest and most important constituents.\u0026nbspEthical investment isn’t always ethical – here’s what to considerCan cutting investment force firms to go green?World’s largest fund manager to sell coal investments You have oil giants (BP, Shell), you have mining companies (Anglo American, BHP Group, Rio Tinto).\u0026nbspA person who saves via a FTSE 100 or FTSE All Share tracker is hitching their wagon to the performance of all of these companies. So if, say, BP does well, they do well.\u0026nbspTalk about carrying the mark of Cain.\u0026nbspDoes this mean their only option is to scour the ranks of actively managed funds with ESG (environmental, social and governance) screening? Do they have to leave the cheapest, and best, route into the market for most novice and smaller investors on the shelf?\u0026nbspOne way of solving this apparent dilemma is through choosing a tracker manager prepared to vote in favour of things like climate resolutions when they’re put forward.\u0026nbspRegular readers of this column will recall that I looked at the voting behaviour of big asset managers in the last edition. I highlighted two separate studies that found European money managers do a lot better than their US peers when it comes to voting in favour of progressive resolutions.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This challenge is already testing my limits but I have also found myself on an educational path.Six weeks in,\u0026nbspI have to admit that I do not have a clean shopping slate. I bought socks and thermals — but in my defence, the former were for my husband and the latter for my sister. I am not sure if they were trolling me but both (not being a party to my pledge) in particular asked me to buy these items for them.Okay, I also bought myself a vintage shirt, non-plastic food covers to replace cling film with and cotton face pads to cleanse the face without the need for additional products.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhy I’m changing my spending habits to help save the planetApart from the vintage shirt these latter purchases are also part of my new outlook on the things I consume: considering materials used in production the use they have and what happens once they become waste.From trying my best to avoid buying lunch wrapped in plastic to opting for plastic free cosmetics, I am trying to progressively reduce my waste.My phone is 20 months old and previously that would mean I would be ready to buy the new shiny phone with the improved camera. Instead I opted to renew my sim-only contract and stick with the handset I have as it’s functioning perfectly well.\u0026nbspAt the weekend I chose to replace the broken pipe for my 12-year-old vacuum cleaner rather than buy a whole new machine. I never knew that Dyson sells parts for even their older models, which came in very handy.Overall, I am changing my approach to things I own and may or may not need to buy, which is reducing my eco anxiety and saving me money.Created with Sketch.Plastic waste across the world: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A father and son on a makeshift boat made from styrofoam paddle through a garbage filled river as they collect plastic bottles that they can sell in junkshops in Manila.

This is also why I am keeping a close eye on the experience of all my fellow pledgers. How can I avoid using plastic further? Can I plan my next holiday by train travel? What local produce can I opt for instead of fruit flown in from thousands of miles away? Can I start growing my own parsley and spring onion (my parents have an annual supply of potatoes from their allotment, maybe I have learnt a thing or two from them)?Modern day consumerism (i.e. capitalism) fuels our desire to have more and more. We are somehow convinced we need all this stuff. The planet is at the desperate point where we need to convince ourselves that we actually do not.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They could be anything from sniffing hints of chemicals on alien worlds to indications that there could be structures or lasers on other planets.Dr Tony Beasley, director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) telescope based in Virginia, US, said: Determining whether we are alone in the universe as technologically capable life is among the most compelling questions in science.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Scientists hope that citizen scientists will be able to find interesting things in the data – whether that is unknown natural phenomena, or something even more unexpected, such as alien life.“Since Breakthrough Listen’s initial data release last year, we have doubled what is available to the public,” said Breakthrough Listen’s lead system administrator, Matt Lebofsky. “It is our hope that these data sets will reveal something new and interesting, be it other intelligent life in the universe or an as-yet-undiscovered natural astronomical phenomenon.”Yuri Milner, an entrepreneur and founder of the Breakthrough initiative, said: For the whole of human history, we had a limited amount of data to search for life beyond Earth.So, all we could do was speculate.Now, as we are getting a lot of data, we can do real science and, with making this data available to general public, so can anyone who wants to know the answer to this deep question.The initiatives and strategies in expanding the search for extraterrestrial life were presented at the the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Seattle.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Since the fox hunting ban in 2004, modified hunts take place using scented trails for the animals to followSwimmers of the Serpentine Swimming Club take part in the Peter Pan Cup race, which is held every Christmas Day at the Serpentine, in central LondonMr Conn, who has faced criticism over his multimillion-pound pay packets, pointed to an improvement in the second half of 2019 over the first half.British Gas’ rate of decline has also slowed down, he said. The UK’s largest energy supplier lost 286,000 of customer accounts last year, which is half the rate of 2018 and a quarter of the rate in 2017.British Gas has lost millions of customers to smaller suppliers and cut thousands of jobs during Mr Conn\u0027s tenure.The company also incurred hefty one-off costs in 2019, including a £476m write-down of its exploration and production business thanks to fluctuating fossil fuel prices.The energy price cap came into force at the start of last year, aiming to\u0026nbspcut outgoings for millions of households.But British Gas has been fiercely critical of how it has been implemented, winning a high court fight in November after arguing that the energy watchdog\u0027s changes to the cap\u0027s methodology were unfair.David Barclay, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: “Today’s results cap an undoubtedly difficult year for Centrica with drops across the board and an increase in debt.The good news, however, is that management has identified that drastic action is required and is duly taking it to make Centrica a smaller, simpler, and more competitive business. Nevertheless, there is still plenty of work to do and investors will have a keen eye on future updates.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK’s largest energy supplier lost 286,000 of customer accounts last year, which is half the rate of 2018 and a quarter of the rate in 2017.British Gas has lost millions of customers to smaller suppliers and cut thousands of jobs during Mr Conn\u0027s tenure.The company also incurred hefty one-off costs in 2019, including a £476m write-down of its exploration and production business thanks to fluctuating fossil fuel prices.The energy price cap came into force at the start of last year, aiming to\u0026nbspcut outgoings for millions of households.But British Gas has been fiercely critical of how it has been implemented, winning a high court fight in November after arguing that the energy watchdog\u0027s changes to the cap\u0027s methodology were unfair.David Barclay, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: “Today’s results cap an undoubtedly difficult year for Centrica with drops across the board and an increase in debt.The good news, however, is that management has identified that drastic action is required and is duly taking it to make Centrica a smaller, simpler, and more competitive business. Nevertheless, there is still plenty of work to do and investors will have a keen eye on future updates.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, at this point in time, contributors are optimistic regarding the outlook for activity over the next 12 months.”Looking ahead, respondents to the survey expect this refreshed optimism to continue with sales anticipated to rise across all UK regions, both in the near term and for the year to come. \u0026nbspGraeme Lusk, of surveyors Walker Fraser Steele in Glasgow, said it was a good time to put a property on the market. “There is still an under supply of quality properties on the market and buyers waiting,” he said.\u0026nbspObservers fear that a long-term lack of supply combined with strong buyer interest and historically low borrowing costs will drive up the prices of homes even further out of the reach of first-time buyers.However official figures on Wednesday showed that the number of homes being both started and completed across the UK rose to their highest levels for 11 years in the 12 months to April last year. However, the 165,730 homes completed and the 202,260 started were well below the government’s target of 300,000 a year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

RBS\u0026nbspwas found to have mis-sold complex financial products to small-business customers in a bid to boost its own bottom line, while its infamous Global Restructuring\u0026nbspGroup destroyed firms to sell off their assets for a profit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Davies\u0026nbspsaid: “The essential reason for this is, as the bank has evolved from the financial crisis and the bailout, we have focused on the NatWest brand.“We have exited a lot of the international businesses which were not profitable. That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS.

Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder. Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013.

(Elisa Bray)At the beginning of the gig, Sir Elton announced he had been diagnosed with “walking pneumonia”, an infection in the respiratory tract.Later, on Instagram, the singer told fans he was “deeply upset” by the situation.He wrote: “I want to thank everyone who attended tonight’s gig in Auckland. I was diagnosed with walking pneumonia earlier today, but I was determined to give you the best show humanly possible.“I played and sang my heart out, until my voice could sing no more. I’m disappointed, deeply upset and sorry. I gave it all I had. Thank-you so much for your extraordinary support and all the love you showed me during tonight’s performance. I am eternally grateful. Love, Elton xx.”Sir Elton’s Auckland show was part of his 300-date Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, the last before he retires.In the recent documentary, Elton John: Uncensored, the singer revealed he was “24 hours from snuffing it” when he contracted a serious infection after having surgery for prostate cancer, and said he was so sick he “had to learn how to walk again”.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, at this point in time, contributors are optimistic regarding the outlook for activity over the next 12 months.”Looking ahead, respondents to the survey expect this refreshed optimism to continue with sales anticipated to rise across all UK regions, both in the near term and for the year to come. \u0026nbspGraeme Lusk, of surveyors Walker Fraser Steele in Glasgow, said it was a good time to put a property on the market. “There is still an under supply of quality properties on the market and buyers waiting,” he said.\u0026nbspObservers fear that a long-term lack of supply combined with strong buyer interest and historically low borrowing costs will drive up the prices of homes even further out of the reach of first-time buyers.However official figures on Wednesday showed that the number of homes being both started and completed across the UK rose to their highest levels for 11 years in the 12 months to April last year. However, the 165,730 homes completed and the 202,260 started were well below the government’s target of 300,000 a year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s also entirely ultrared, or highly reflective, which is commonplace in the faraway Twilight Zone of our solar system known as the the Kuiper Belt.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The reddish color is indicative of organic molecules.While frozen methane is present, no water has yet been found on the body, which is an estimated 22 miles (36 kilometers) long tip to tip. At a news conference Thursday in Seattle, New Horizons\u0027 chief scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute said its size was roughly that of the city.As for the snowman shape, it\u0027s not nearly as flat on the backside as previously thought. Neither the small nor big sphere is fully round, but far from the flatter pancake shape scientists reported a year ago. The research team likened the somewhat flattened spherical forms to the shape of M\u0026ampMs.No rings or satellites have been found. The light cratering suggests Arrokoth dates back to the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago. It likely was created by a slow, gentle merger between two separate objects that possibly were an orbiting pair. The resulting fused body is considered a contact binary.This kind of slow-motion hookup likely arose from collapsing clouds in the solar nebula, as opposed to intense collisions theorized to form these planetesimals, or little orbiting bodies.New Horizons flew past Arrokoth on Jan. 1, 2019, more than three years after the spacecraft visited Pluto. Originally nicknamed Ultima Thule, the object received its official name in November Arrokoth means sky in the language of the Native American Powhatan people.Launched in 2006, the spacecraft is now 316 million miles (509 million kilometers) beyond Arrokoth. The research team is looking for other potential targets to investigate. Powerful ground telescopes still under construction will help survey this part of the sky.Emerging technology will enable scientists to develop a mission that could put a spacecraft in orbit around Pluto, 3 billion miles (5 billion kilometers) away, according to Stern. After a few years, that same spacecraft could be sent even deeper into the Kuiper Belt to check out other dwarf planets and objects, he said.The New Horizons scientists reported their latest findings at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as in three separate papers in the journal Science.David Jewitt of the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the studies, said a flyby mission like New Horizons, where encounters last just a few days, is hardly ideal.For future missions, we need to be able to send spacecraft to the Kuiper Belt and keep them there in orbit around objects, Jewitt wrote in a companion piece in Science. That would allow these intriguing bodies to be studied in stunning geological and geophysical detail, he noted.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Usually they’ll have the page number still memorised.“We’ve got a couple of quizzes and games, too, although at the moment they don’t get updated very often, so people might have to wait a while for new ones to come up.”Mr Kwan has now been running Teefax for about five years – and has dozens of contributors working on it from around the country.BBC to review cuts to Red Button service used by most vulnerable“We don’t make any money from this – it is all run by enthusiasts.

Free health care? A jobs guarantee? Isn’t that socialism?Cardi B and Mark Ruffalo among celebrities backing Bernie SandersWhy the rise of Bernie Sanders is making some Democrats nervousWill bitter moderates vote for Bernie Sanders?But while policies such as free universal healthcare are seen as extreme in the US they are perfectly ordinary in Europe.The higher tax and spending proposed by Sanders would also not be out of place on the other side of the Atlantic.The economist Paul Krugman says Sanders is better described as a European-style social democrat rather than a socialist, not least because Sanders isn’t proposing to nationalise private industries.OK, but would this ruin the American economy?The French economist Thomas Piketty even argues Sanders’\u0026nbsppolicies could be beneficial to the US economy\u0026nbspby raising the country’s growth rate, and says that his wealth distribution policies tap into an older tradition of American policymaking.“Remember that the US is actually the country that invented progressive taxation of income and wealth in the 20th century,” Piketty points out.Others have described Sanders as a “New Dealer”, referring to the progressive economic policies put in place by former\u0026nbspDemocratic President Franklin Roosevelt in the wake of the Great Depression of the 1930s.So why are people describing Sanders as dangerous?But it may also be that the genuinely fear Sanders’ policies, even if they are in the mainstream of the European tradition, will do damage in the US context.Or they may be assuming that Sanders, if he won power, would pursue policies that go much further than those he has proposed, with the 78-year-old proving more radical in office, perhaps like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.Against this, though, is the institutional fact that US presidents are constrained by Congress in what policies they can enact. Sanders might be in favour of relatively radical redistribution, but that’s not true of the wider Democratic party.Even some of Sanders’ rivals for the Democratic nomination, such as Pete Buttigieg, are critical of his policies such as the $15 federal minimum wage.That’s why many analysts – even those who support the principle of “medicare-for-all” – think there is little chance he could actually deliver it, even if he won power.And while some financiers are sounding the alarm, others are more sanguine.Another Wall Street Bank, JPMorgan, recently told its clients that, even if Sanders were elected, “we put the probability of major changes like medicare-for-all or a wealth tax at less than 5 percent.”All of which raises a question: is the risk less that Sanders ruins the US economy than that he disappoints his supporters?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But consider how it has trashed its once-proud reputation:The use of £.billion a year of public money to crush commercial rivals and relentlessly expand. The tedious, institutional liberal-left bias in news, drama and “comedy”. The overpaid executives churning out “woke” bilge, knowing the billions will always keep rolling in.The betrayal of over-s. The waste.Fundamentally it’s a dinosaur in the Netflix era and irrelevant to many, especially young people raised on YouTube.The Government must be bold.

They employ more people than large companies and are responsible for  per cent of recent job creation.”The eldest of three children, Sunak studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford.He went on to work at investment bank Goldman Sachs before setting up hedge fund Theleme Partners  years ago.In  he stood for election in Richmond, North Yorks, after the constituency’s previous MP, former Tory leader William Hague, retired.It was the safest Conservative seat in the country and his victory was assured.Former Brexit minister David Jones MP told The Sun: “He is very bright. There was no doubt from the start that he was destined for high office.”After being elected, Sunak moved to a -acre property with its own lake and boathouse in an idyllic small village near Northallerton.It was there he has held lavish summer parties, with champagne and canapes served by unormed staff.Though he earned several million from his investment fund, much of his huge wealth comes through we Akshata’s family.She is the daughter of self-made Indian tech billionaire N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of firm Infosys.Akshata, whose shares in the company are worth around £million, also runs a fashion label.The couple married in  and have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka.Former PM Theresa May made Sunak a housing under-secretary in January .Her successor Boris promoted him to Chief Secretary to the Treasury last July.William Hague described Sunak as “exceptional”, and ex-Chancellor Sajid Javid once tweeted: “The force is strong with young Sunak.”Now Sunak has taken Javid’s job, which is good news for Brexit-supporting Tories, because while Javid backed Remain during the referendum, Sunak was always a Leaver.Clwyd West MP David Jones, who was on the advisory board of pressure group Leave Means Leave, said: “Boris recognises that there is going to be tough negotiation with the EU.“He realises he’s going to need the Treasury behind him in that.“The Prime Minister now has a strong ally in the Treasury.”Sunak backed Brexit as he felt excessive EU regulations were shackling the nation’s small businesses.He said: “EU red tape is holding them back.“From working in my mum’s tiny chemist shop to my experience building large businesses, I have seen how we should support free enterprise and innovation to ensure Britain has a stronger future.”Sunak, whose grandparents were born in India and emigrated to Britain in the s, also felt it was wrong to give EU citizens easy access to the UK when it was often denied to nationalities outside of the Brussels bloc.Describing himself as a British Indian whose hobbies include “keeping fit, cricket, football and movies”, he said: “I come from a family of immigrants. I am grateful to Britain for giving my family the opportunity to settle here and forge a better le.“I am proud of our country’s generous approach to welcoming hardworking and ambitious immigrants and believe it is in our interests to continue doing so.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But why The war between Blair and Brown blighted Labour’s years in office and held back progress.Even Theresa May’s dismal tenure was worsened by Philip Hammond’s soul-sapping negativity.The friendship of David Cameron and George Osborne, by contrast, succeeded in restoring sanity to our finances.So Boris Johnson knows he must have the Treasury fully onside.He and chief adviser Dominic Cummings need it to enact their ideas, not resist or dilute them.It is clear Sajid Javid’s advisers were considered just such an obstacle.The Sun has a lot of time for The Saj, a decent bloke who commendably stood by his staff.His is a sad departure.He might have proved a fine Chancellor.But Rishi Sunak should too.He is very bright, imaginative and enthused by our post-Brexit prospects.We wish him luck, with a historic Budget next month.Most of the reshuffle was welcome — three appointments in particular.New Attorney General Suella Braverman has an appetite to stop leftie campaigners getting like-minded judges to impose via their courts a political agenda rejected at the ballot box.Anne-Marie Trevelyan looks like the no-nonsense type to rein in the scandalous £.billion foreign aid budget.And Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden will, we hope, ensure non-payment of the BBC licence is decriminalised before ushering in a subscription model.We do have one bit of advice for Boris as he prepares to deliver Brexit in full and spend billions, though: It is fine to bring the Treasury in line. But do not lose sight of the balance sheet.Gordon Brown did — and Britain is still counting the cost.ELLIE Gould fought back hard against her ex-boyfriend’s frenzied kne attack.It wasn’t enough.

That information has not been lost.So why are we just sitting back letting Spain and Mexico get on with it Britain needs money for its exciting new railway line and all the hospitals Boris Johnson has promised.Andthere’s a small mountain of it sitting at the bottom of the sea off Mexico’s east coast, why don’t we just sneak over there and help ourselves Certainly, our new six-year-old Chancellor should be considering this . . .  once he’s finished his morning bowl of Frosties and tidied his room.Think about it. We have naval ships in the region waging a hopeless war against South American drug cartels. So why not simply ask them to drive around with their sonar on I feel sure thatthis equipment can find a near-silent Russian submarine gently humming its way through the depths, it would have no trouble at all spotting  tons of gold and silver.Or we could draft in RRS Boaty McBoatface . That’s designed to map the seabed and would be a very useful tool.Frankly, having it in the Caribbean looking for treasure is a much better use of it than having it wandering around Antarctica studying penguins and looking for more dreary evidence of climate change. We know already.I bet the crew would be happier too.Of course, when we do find the loot, Spain will claim it’s theirs, in the same way they say they own Gibraltar.No worries. We’ll just behave like we do when the Greeks say they want the Elgin Marbles back.And Mexico  It’s true the jewels and the gold were sourced from their neck of the woods.But as every schoolboy knows, it’s “finders, keepers”.Britain has a reputation for fair play and decency, but in a cut-and-thrust world we need to be a bit more devious.Maybe then we could find the loot and tell the world we hadn’t. “Nope. Nothing there. Sorry.”IF I were to list all the Bond music in order of greatness – and being a man, EVERYTHING has to be listed like this – Octopussy’s All Time High by Rita Coolidge would be the all-time high.I love Rita Coolidge. She sounds like she’s singing while sitting down.At No, from On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, I’d have We Have All The Time In The World, by Louis ­Armstrong, who sounds like he’s lying down in the bath. And at No it’d be the ­incidental music used during the ski chase in the same movie.I’d have to go a long way down the list – past Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang from ­Thunderball, past the music used in the cinema adverts before the film started, and down past the Muzak playing when I took my seat – before I got to the dreary song chosen for the ­latest  outing.Performed by Billie Eilish, it is about as memorable as the middle of a Tuesday night.LIKE lots of box-set enthusiasts, I was captivated by Netflix’s drama The Stranger.“Let’s do one more”, I’d say every night. “Come on. It’s only am.”Set in northern England and starring Richard Armitage, the plot twisted and turned, building to the point that in the final episode I started to wonder how all the endless storylines could all be brought together and tied off.I was intrigued. Fascinated. On the edge of my seat.And then – with a load of stuff still up in the air – it just ended.What I had sat through, then, was a beautully told eight-hour joke. With no punchline.THE BBC has signed up Greta Thunberg to present a new series about monster truck racing in Texas.Only kidding. She’s been signed to present a show on – you’ll never guess – climate change.“I can’t wait. It’ll be so exciting,” said no one.I’VE always said hybrid cars are too heavy, thanks to the fact they have two engines.And now this ­photo of a Toyota Prius proves it.NORMALLY, I’m in full agreement with The Sun’s television critic, Ally Ross.But his review of ­Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop Lab show on Netflix was wide of the mark.He described it as “dumb and dangerous”.Wrong, mate. It was way worse than that.At one point, they had two women playing with a vibrator the size of a JCB.And somehow they managed to make the scene even more boring than The One Show.WHENEVER somebody builds a really good bridge, I’ll travel miles out of my way to go and look at it. I realise this is a bit tragic.My favourite bridge in the whole wide world spans the Humber.It’s so graceful and delicate – and when I stand at one end and watch it disappear into the mist on a summer’s morning, I often suffer from a small but embarrassing trouser moment.The only annoying thing about the Humber Bridge is that they went to all the trouble and expense of building it simply to connect the small village of Hessle to the even smaller village of Barton. Two places no one has ever heard of.The fabulous Oresund Bridge was needed because it links Sweden and Denmark.It’s the same story in San Francisco, which has many great bridges that connect the city to the rest of Calornia.That’s the point of a bridge. It links two places that need to be linked.Which brings me on to Boris Johnson’s plan to build a -mile bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.Hmmm. I’m aware the Chinese have built a sea bridge this long, but this is a nation that built a whole new coronavirus hospital in SIX DAYS.We are just not that fast. We can’t even build a new railway line without a -year argument.And the fact is that when we finish our new bridge, midway through the rd Century, we will have linked a place called Larne to a place called Portpatrick.Now, I don’t want to have a downer on the plan.Butwe are going to build a -mile bridge over the sea, wouldn’t it be more usefulit went from Dover to Calais Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More like an actress acting the part of someone who cares. As so many of them do.“I find Portman’s type of activism deeply offensive to those of us who actually do the work. I’m not writing this out of bitterness, I am writing out of disgust,” she wrote.Unfortunately, coming from someone who has been so integral in the protest movement, this sounds like sour grapes.Natalie’s response to Rose’s criticism was as elegant and as understated as her protest.She said: “I agree with Ms McGowan that it is inaccurate to call me ‘brave’ for wearing a garment with women’s names on it.“Brave is a term I more strongly associate with actions like those of the women who have been testying against Harvey Weinstein the last few weeks.”She also responded to Rose’s accusation that Natalie has only been directed twice by women.But in this criticism, Rose is seriously missing the point. Female directors don’t get as far in Hollywood as male ones, which is precisely what Natalie is pointing out with her cloak protest. Therefore, there are fewer available to work with.As Natalie said: “It is true I’ve only made a few films with women. In my long career, I’ve only gotten the chance to work with female directors a few times . . . Unfortunately, the unmade films I have tried to make are a ghost history.“Female films have been incredibly hard to get made at studios, or to get independently financed. If these films do get made, women face enormous challenges during the making of them.”By the way, this is not the first time Natalie has protested from within the system.While presenting the best director category at the Golden Globes in , she introduced the line-up by saying: “And here are the all-male nominees.”Again, it’s not a shouty, noisy street protest. But it served to make her point. Just that she did it in a dferent way than Rose might. And that’s fine.In fact, some people think that Rose’s in-your-face type of protest risks alienating some people.I think women should support each other when it comes to vying for equality.But also, Rose just sounded spiteful when she said Natalie was “an actress acting like someone who cares”.Rose is a hero to many women. But she needs to understand that whether their contribution is big or small, loud or subtle, anyone’s effort to affect change helps.JANE Fonda, who looked fabulous at the Oscars, has said she is done with plastic surgery.Well, I guess  is as good an age as any to stop nipping and tucking.She must have a great doctor, as whatever the actress has had done has been done very well indeed – because, in my experience, it’s not often you look better after a facelt than you did before.PERHAPS Andrea Leadsom had a premonition that she was going to be axed as Business Secretary in this week’s Cabinet reshuffle.She recently wrote a column obliquely warning Boris Johnson not to cut the number of female ministers in his Cabinet.Addressing the issue of female board members among FTSE  companies, Andrea wrote: “Working in the City in the Nineties, I saw myself how a male-dominated environment can limit a career.”Unfortunately for her, the warning did not save her skin and she has been sacked, along with Theresa Villiers as Environment Secretary and housing minister Esther McVey.By the way, eight of the  members of Mr Johnson’s first Cabinet were female –  per cent.Despite these sackings, that figure has actually risen – slightly – to nearly  per cent.Ideally, the split would be an even -.But the reality is that business and politics can both be brutal.Men and women alike must accept they might one day get the sack.It simply goes with the territory.Being selected on the basis of gender is just as wrong as being sacked on that basis.Right person, right job, regardless of their gender.THAT is what true equality means.SAY what you like about the bonkers lestyle advice dispensed by Gwyneth Paltrow on Goop – and some of it is seriously out there.But whatever she is doing clearly works.She is, at the age of , nothing short of radiant.In fact she looks amazing and also happy.Not only that but she became instantly relatable to parents everywhere with a confession that her -year- old daughter finds her embarrassing.That’s a good reminder there is nothing like a teenager to keep you normal and down to earth for fear that you will embarrass them, no matter what you do.Although, to be fair, perhaps Gwyneth’s daughter has had a predisposition to feel embarrassed by her mother ever since she named her  . . . Apple.What are the ethics of seat-reclining on a long-haul flight An American Airlines passenger raised the question after video-shaming a fellow traveller who punched and pushed her seat when she reclined it.Bearing in mind the recline button moves the seat about in, I suspect this chap has anger issues, as reclining a seat that has a recline button is hardly an act of aggression.I’d disable the recline button and then all you have to fight over is the armrest.DAMIAN Hurleys resemblance to his mother, Liz, is uncanny.More so than ever in the latest shots of the two of them together, which he posted online this week.Some people think it is vaguely unsettling that he looks more like Liz Hurley than Liz Hurley.But as a mum myself, I think it’s heartwarming a teenage boy should be so happy to emulate his mother.OH the utter folly of the face tattoo!The latest to succumb to this trend, which a few years ago would be, frankly, unthinkable, is Amber Rose.She has had the words Bash and Slash tattooed across her forehead in old English manuscript style.It’s a reference, apparently, to the model’s three-month-old son Slash, and six-year-old son Sebastian. And, obviously, it’s lovely that she loves her children so much.But tattooing their names on her forehead where they will remain for all her le  All I can say is: Tattoo in haste . . . repent at leisure.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We truly do.But do Harry and Meghan understand and ever admit to themselves that they owe EVERYTHING to their royal connections Without the magic dust that royalty bestows, JP Morgan — one of the world’s richest banks — would never have flown them in a private jet to an exclusive company beano. Don’t tell Greta Thunberg!And without his royal blood, Prince Harry would not be in talks with Goldman Sachs about a future relationship.If they were not British royalty, Meghan would be a B-list actress whom few people had ever heard of and Harry an old soldier with two rotten A-levelsfrom Eton — a school where my dog Stan could get four good grades and an offer from Oxbridge.I do not doubt Harry and Meghan’s sincerity when they say they want to be financially independent.But because they are poncing on royal connections, the couple have a duty of care to the Queen and to this country.Please don’t embarrass the Royal Family, or British people who shelled out £million for your wedding.Please do not turn into the preening glove puppets of investment bankers.Oh Harry, please don’t turn into Tony Blair in a tiara.Oh Meghan, don’t become the st-century Fergie.Prince Andrew’s reckless friendship with convicted billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein has humiliated and damaged the Royal Family.Andrew’s total lack of judgment may have done irreparable harm to the monarchy.Many of us wonderthe institution will last after the Queen has gone.So show some dignity, Harry and Meghan. Engage your brains, not your bank balance.Have a little DISCRETION. Please do not pimp your royal connections to any passing dodgy billionaire or investment banker who claims to care deeply about your charity work.Frankly, it doesn’t look good so far.The nation cringed when Prince Harry buttonholed Disney boss Bob Iger at the London premiere of The Lion King, aggressively pitching Meghan’s availability for “voiceover” work.A member of the Royal Family begging a Hollywood big-shot for work was not a pretty sight.When they handed in their letter of resignation, Harry and Meghan made lofty announcements about “collaborating” with the Queen, as though Her Majesty, , is some grime DJ who could be brought in to remix their latest single.The brutal truth is that we will not see much of Harry and Meghan in these parts.This week they sacked  loyal UK staff and shut their Buckingham Palace office.But by turning their backs on the royal le, Harry and Meghan have placed themselves in an almost impossible situation.They claim to want to be financially independent of Prince Charles and the British taxpayer.Then they will have to grab the big pay days where they can.They will have to earn phenomenal sums of money to fund the lavish lestyle to which they are accustomed.But there is absolutely nothing in either of their CVs to suggest they can make that kind of dough without flogging their royal connections to the highest bidder.If Harry and Meghan are going to support themselves, they are going to have to get their hands dirty in the working world.Harry’s discussions with Goldman Sachs may be focused on his charity work right now, but investment bankers are not renowned for their boundless human compassion.Big bankers — and mega-rich companies like Netflix and Apple — will look at Harry and Meghan and wonder what they can get out of them.Harry and Meghan are free to demean themselves, as Harry did so spectacularly when he shook his diamond-encrusted begging bowl at the boss of Disney.But please don’t demean this country.Please don’t debase the Royal Family, as Prince Andrew has done.Please, Harry and Meghan — do not embarrass the Queen.Because let’s face it, chaps — without your royal connections, the pair of you really don’t add up to very much at all.After all those wild decades, Keith – who is said to have smoked an estimated , fags in his time – clearly believes in moderation in all things.Especially moderation in moderation.IN a pithy turn of phrase worthy of Oscar Wilde, one commentator mused that Labour’s dishevelled Tracy Brabin looked like she had been “banged over a wheelie bin” in her off-the-shoulder frock in the House of Commons.Showing Tracy how it is done, Kate Beckinsale looked stunning in a very similar off-the-shoulder number at a pre-Oscars party.Kate also looks as though she has never even seen a wheelie bin.But it’s not true. I recall Debbie Harry was a dazzling double NME winner in  – Pin-Up Of The Year and Best Female Singer.The NME may be  years old. But NME award winners never get any older.THE coronavirus could well be China’s Chernobyl – the national calamity that changes everything.As the global death toll of the virus nears ,, the old men in Beijing who run China have never looked so woefully out of their depth.The greatest hero in China today is Dr Li Wenliang, the -year-old Wuhan doctor who tried to warn the Communist regime of the virus.Dr Li was arrested, bullied, humiliated, accused of scaremongering and later died of the virus.That is what happens in a one-party state that considers all criticism to be treason.China does not look like the next economic superpower today.China looks like an inept one-party state that failed to grasp the seriousness of the virus, then stubbornly refused to heed the warnings that could have contained it, and has now exported it to the rest of the world.The coronavirus came out of the so-called wet markets of China, where every conceivable animal is kept in filthy conditions to cater for the Chinese appetite for “exotic” animals.Wolf pups, koala bears and assorted rats, bats and snakes are all on offer for the discerning wildle gourmet, many under the counter.These markets were the breeding ground for Sars nearly  years ago, and they were the breeding ground for the coronavirus.Exactly how stupid can a regime be that allows the existence of these unregulated markets  The virus that is now polluting the entire planet was totally avoidable.Mikhail Gorbachev was convinced that the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in  caused the collapse of the Soviet Union five years later.The Chernobyl explosion “opened the possibility of much greater freedom of expression”, said Gorbachev. “To the point that the system as we knew it could no longer continue.”If the coronavirus brings down China’s ruling Communist elite, it will be exactly what they deserve.Now Leo has seen his Fine Gael party poll a wretched . per cent of the vote in the Irish general election, going from power to third place overnight.Looks like Leo Varadkar is a teeny-weeny politician now.Now BBC chairman David Clementi squeaks that ending the licence fee will mean scrapping children’s channel CBeebies.Stop our money and you will make all the kiddies cry!But the openly biased BBC stopped being a state broadcaster years ago.It no longer deserves to be funded like one.TANYA McDonnell is a modern success story.Tanya was working in McDonald’s in Washington, Tyne-and-Wear, for £ an hour until a modelling agency spotted her holiday shots on Instagram.“I’d always looked up to people like Kate Moss,” says Tanya. “But I didn’t think I had a chance because I wasn’t pretty enough.”Only in the age of social media could a girl go from having her picture taken on holiday to making a living as a model.And only in the age of social media could someone who looks like Tanya McDonnell fret that she is not pretty enough.I didn’t know he had one.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ending free movement changes all that.The Government has listened to the clear message from the  referendum and the  General Election that the public wants a reduction in low-skilled immigration.We want to see overall numbers down and this new system will deliver. Our new immigration system will turn off the tap of cheap, foreign low-skilled labour.Workers coming to the UK will have to prove they have something to offer.We are not closing our doors, but we will finally be able to choose who comes through them.We will attract the top talent from anywhere in the world.Allowing us to attract the brightest and the best from around the globe who will help our economy to thrive.From next year, all skilled workers will need to earn enough points to work in the UK.They will need to speak English, have a firm job offer, and meet the salary requirements.Extra points will be awarded to people who have the most to offer, including those working in a profession where there is a real skills shortage.We will continue to monitor – through expert advisers –there are shortages and gaps to be filled.For those coming to work in our NHS and schools, points will be awarded in line with pay scales for their professions.This is only the beginning, and this week we will set out our plans to go even further with a system to deliver the reforms you want.For the first time in decades, the UK will have control over who comes to our great country and how our immigration system works.We’ve got Brexit done, now we’re moving on to focus on the people’s other priorities.We promised to unleash our country’s full potential and we are doing just that. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He’d throw things at the windows and look through the letterbox. I was terried he would take my kids.”She added: “My own home was like a prison. The lights and TV were never on.

Ministers and their aides have called on the PM to sack Andrew Sabisky, who called for a “universal contraception” programme to stop the creation of a “permanent underclass”. The -year-old researcher has also compared women’s sport to the paralympics, dismissed concerns over female genital mutilation and described a series of female politicians as “dim”. Angry ministers will demand the Prime Minister overrules Cummings and sacks Sabisky and reports suggest they are ready to boycott meetings with him and stonewall all communication until he does. One government special adviser told BuzzFeed News: “Hiring this imbecile is an insult to those who came before, which is a minor point I know, but jesus wept it makes me ashamed.” Labour has urged the PM to sack Sabisky, saying there were “no words” to describe his comments while reports suggest that other advisers will refuse to work with him.Sabisky is understood to have argued on a blog run by Cummings that existing vaccination laws could pave a way for compulsory birth control. “One way to get around problems of unplanned pregnancies creating a permanent underclass would be to legally enforce universal uptake of long-term contraception at the onset of puberty,” he wrote. “Vaccination laws give it a precedent, I would argue.”Jon Trickett MP, Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Office Minister said: “There are really no words to describe Boris Johnson’s appointment as one of his senior advisers a man who is on record as supporting the forced sterilisation of people he considers not worthy. He must of course be removed from this position immediately.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tories closed 1300 family centres","story":"w.mantis  Tories have closed , family centres in last  years figures revealIt is a serious issue that the services that Sure Start centres offer are much more thinly spread than they were a decade agoMore than one in three Sure Start centres have been axed under the Tories, it has emerged.  nBrutal cuts have seen , of the vital family centres shut since , ministers admit.  nMillions of parents rely on Sure Start, which offers clinics, and health and parenting support.  nAt their peak in  , there were , centres.  nBut Tory austerity slashed numbers by up to  per cent in some areas.

She knows getting this wrong at the ­beginning makes for unhappy endings in teenage years and adulthood. She knows that one of the main causes of death in young mums is suicide, which is why she is building a support network to help them. Kate also knows that no matter where you come from, children and parents need support. But background determines whether that support will be forthcoming. Which is why the Tory attack on Sure Start centres is all the more shocking. Today we reveal how austerity cuts mean , have shut since  – that’s more than one in three. Yet Sure Starts do everything that Kate is talking about and more. They not only provide clinics, health advice and support for parents but can identy abuse and neglect early. Now , fewer children have such protection, and that is a national scandal. Better to prevent a child being abused in the first place than wring our hands in horror after the event. Better to spot a young mother’s depression and treat it than to weep at her graveside. Better that Sure Starts catch ­problems early than for them to fester and cost the NHS an extra £million a year. Sure Starts have proved their worth since being introduced in . Now it’s time for Boris Johnson to recognise their value too. Healthy attitude If there is one thing the three Labour leadership contenders can agree on, it is that the NHS needs to be protected from Tory threats to its existence.  Sir Keir Starmer tells the Sunday Mirror today of his own painful experiences sitting by the bedside of his mother and more recently his mother-in-law.Although he sadly lost them both, he has nothing but praise for the NHS care thatthey received.And it has made him all the more determined to ensure the health service gets the resources it needs. It was the post-war Labour government which introduced the NHS. It was successive Labour governments which looked after it.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe Crown Prosecution Service can continue with a domestic violence charge eventhe victim doesnapost want the case to go - and hereaposs why. Questions have been raised about the CPSapos decision to pursue a case against Caroline Flack following the staraposs tragic death on Saturday.The former Love Island presenter was was being taken to court for assault following an alleged early-morning altercation with Caroline’s boyfriend Lewis Burton, , in December. Lewis refused to apospress chargesapos - essentially an American concept - but the CPS decided to pursue the case. Following her death, broadcast and talent agent Louisa McDonald released a statement on behalf of Carolineaposs management firm in which they criticised the CPSapos decision to pursue the high-profile case. The Crown Prosecution Service pursued this when they knew not only how very vulnerable Caroline was but also that the alleged victim did not support the prosecution and had disputed the CPS version of events, she said. The CPS should look at themselves today and how they pursued a show trial that was not only without merit but not in the public interest. And ultimately resulted in signicant distress to Caroline. Our thoughts are with Caroline’s family at this time. Francis Ridley, Money Talent Management. Asked about the criticism of the decision to prosecute Caroline, a CPS spokesman said: Our deepest sympathies go to the family and friends of Caroline Flack. Given the tragic circumstances, we will not comment on the specics of this case at this stage.  Nazir Afzal, a former Chief Crown Prosecutor, spoke to LBC about the case. He said the concept of prosecutions where the victim or complainant doesnapost want to pursue it is actually very common. Adding, itaposs not because itaposs Caroline Flack, it would happen dozens of times every week. This is because we as a country, he said, have decided that weaposre not handling domestic abuse very well. According to the CPSapos Domestic Violence: How prosecution decisions are reached document, they must be satisfied there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against each defendant on each charge.  If there is enough evidence, the case will proceed providing itaposs in the public interest - eventhe victim does wish the provide evidence or support the prosecution. We always think very carefully about the interests of the victim when we decide where the public interest lies. But we prosecute cases on behalf of the public at large and not just based on the interests of any articular inidual. There can be dficulties in striking this balance. The views and interests of the victim are important,but they cannot be the final word on the subject of a CPS prosecution. Any future risks to the victim, their children or any other potential victim have to be taken into consideration.  A case can proceed eventhe victim withdraws support or no longer wishes to give evidence. Sometimes, victims will ask the police not to proceed any further with the case and say that they no longer wish to give evidence. There may be a number of explanations for this. This does not mean that the case will automatically be stopped. The document then outlines that the more serious the offence, the more likely we are tho prosecute in the public interest, eventhe victim says that they do not wish us to do so. In cases where we have sufficient other evidence, we may decide to proceed without relying on the evidence of the victim at all. The CPS can continue to pursue a case eventhe parties involved have reconciled or the injury was minor. In certain circumstances a victimaposs statement can be used as evidence without them being called to court.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA father has described the horror he felt after holding the tumour which was killing his baby girl. Seven-year-old Leah had le-changing surgery to remove the tumour which had grown around her spine and key blood vessels in August last year.Parents Stephen and Claire Bennett, from St Helens, Liverpool,  were told by other hospitals the operation would be too risky to perform but eventually their daughter was saved by staff at Alder Hey and Royal Liverpool hospitals, reports the Liverpool Echo.Before the six-hour operation a D model was made of the tumour which Stephen held. He said: Staring at it in front of my eyes was just horrying - it looked huge and holding it made the hairs on my neck stand up. He added: I held in my hands the very thing that was killing my little girl and that is quite a chilling experience. I had a strange mix of both extremely positive and extremely negative emotions going through me. Claire was unable to hold the model as she found it too dficult. Leah was diagnosed with the tumour last year after suffering from back ache on and off. When the couple were first shown the MRI scan, Stephen said it was completely horrying.  Stephen, , said: You start to think, how the hell is she going to beat this  How could this have possibly grown inside her without us knowing  It was completely horrying. I felt so empty and helpless and like I had let her down and failed as a parent. The parents were told that surgeons from Great Ormond Street, Bristol and Manchester had all given the opinion that surgery was not even possible for Leah, but Claire begged a consultant to speak to the surgical team to seethe was anything they could do to remove the tumour. After the team began to operate, Leah was only given a  per cent chance of surgeons being able to remove the tumour without it causing major harm like paralysis due to the damage it could cause to her spinal cord, or death.The surgery was carried out by Joanne Minford, Matthew Jones, Fiona Murphy and Professor John Brennan - a vascular specialist from Royal Liverpool Hospital. After the couple were told the operation was successful they broke down into floods of tears. After the success of the six-hour operation, Leah was discharged and home in time for her seventh birthday. She has also been fundraising for the hospital with her sister Phoebe.

William Smith was working as guard in the city centre when he recognised killer Michael Foran and alerted police. Foran strangled his girlfriend June Jones and then repeatedly stabbed her in a brutal attack at her West Bromwich flat in December . After going on the run, Foran was eventually tracked down and sentenced to le in prison in October .Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Will said: I told [West Midlands Police] what Iaposd seen. They asked me to send the pictures, I sent them to them.They said theyaposd get to Liverpool for the Saturday morning. They came, introduced themselves and within half an hour this male was detained. June Katie Jones, , was found with  kne wounds around her neck and the left side of her chest and is believed to have lain dead in the bath of the flat she shared with Foran for three weeks before she was found. Her body was only discovered when police forced their way in to the property on New Yearaposs Eve, .  William identied him following a public appeal and alerted West Midlands Police to his whereabouts. Dad-of-six Will shared a chain of emails between himself and West Midlands Police in which an officer thanked him for helping them capture the wanted man.  In one message a detective working for the force told the -year-old security guard: Thanks Will, all down to you! Will said he wanted to make sure Foran was caught: Iaposm a father. I have a daughter, I have granddaughters. He claims he attempted to report the sighting of Foran to Merseyside Police before contacting the West Midlands force. However, a spokeswoman for the force said Merseyside Police were unable to locate any log of this call to operators.  Will received an award from Interr, the security company he is employed by at River Island, for his efforts in helping capture a wanted murderer. Foran, , from West Bromwich, was captured on CCTV leaving his flat with friend Keith OaposDwyer before  escaping to Liverpool in his accompliceaposs car. On January , Foran was spotted on a camera at an Esso petrol station in  Anfield and police said they believed he had  fled to the city in the hope of travelling to Ireland and evading justice. Just four days later, detectives confirmed that Foran was found  begging on the streets of Liverpool city centre, almost four weeks after police believed June was murdered on December .  He was arrested and transported back to the West Midlands where he was charged with Juneaposs murder. A Birmingham Crown Court In October , Foran was sentenced to le in prison to serve a minimum of  years before being eligible to apply for parole. Keith O’Dwyer, , from West Bromwich, pleaded guilty to assisting an offender. He was sentenced to  months in prison. The family of June, also known as Katie, released the following statement moments after he was sentenced. "},{"url":null,"title":"hospices not places people delivered","story":"w.mantis  Hospices are not places people are delivered to die - they are full of love n Rachel Clarke is based at Katharine House Hospice in Oxfordshire. She has written a book called A Doctor’s Story of Love and Loss  where she talks about her experiences and the patients she has cared for n Rachel Clarke is a palliative care doctor at Katharine House Hospice in Oxfordshire.  nWhen patients are admitted, many are fearful of death.  nBut Rachel and her colleagues are determined to help them live le to the full before they die.  nIn a second moving extract from her book Dear Le: A Doctor’s Story of Love and Loss, she remembers some of the patients and their stories which will stay with her forever...  nDorothy  nDorothy was admitted to the hospice on a Monday. n“There is no point in spending time with me,” she declared on arrival. “I will be dead on Thursday.”  n“What makes you think that ” I asked, intrigued.  n  naposWe must act now to save our hospices - or children will go without careapos   nHospice doctoraposs heartbreaking description how cancer aposstole her dad bit by bitapos   n nShe gave me the kind of lingering stare a teacher reserves for the classroom dunce, then explained: “Mr Edwards. The senior consultant on the surgical ward told me my bowels had stopped working and I would be dead in six days. That was on Friday. I have three days left.”  nI knew the rudiments of Dorothy’s story. Admitted to AE with acute bowel ­obstruction. Given her age –  – an almost certainly terminal diagnosis. But at no stage was there mention of Thursday.  n“I will concede I do not feel full of death,” Dorothy stated. “I feel full of le. Butyou don’t mind, I would rather be left alone. I have little time left and I would like to read my newspaper.”  nRarely in my career had I been dismissed more magnicently. I hardly dared respond.  n“Based on my medical assessment, I am not at all certain you’ll be dead on Thursday,” I told Dorothy. “If you had more time, is there any way you would like to spend it ”  n  n   n“Were I not to be dead on Thursday, then I would certainly be playing bridge with my local group, as I have done every Thursday for the last two decades. But I can assure you I will be dying instead.”  n“How about this,” I proposed. “We plan for bridge, unless death intervenes ”  n“Young lady, I will humour youit makes you feel useful.”  nA good day, for me, in the hospice, is one in which I feel we have helped someone die with comfort and dignity intact.  nBut infinitely preferable are the days when we have helped a dying patient live – be that basking in a bath filled with insanely priced bubblebath, stroking the family Labrador, saying a rushed but no less momentous “I do” from a wheelchair decked in flowers in the hospice chapel, or watching gold finches gleam in the trees outside.  nIn a ward where every patient has a terminal diagnosis, le, in all its loveliness, goes on.  nOn Thursday morning, the nurses busied themselves with washing, sprucing, plumping and preening. When Dorothy finally emerged, dressed for her bridge trip, she could have been Boudica.  nDesperately thin, her chariot a wheelchair, a pre-emptive dose of morphine in her veins, yet nonetheless sitting ramrod straight with crocodile handbag perched on her lap and an impeccably coordinated green tweed skirt, cashmere cardigan and court shoes.  nFlushed with all the fuss and attention, Dorothy was, for that Thursday only, the queen of our ward – and she knew it. For a moment, our eyes met, and she nodded ­imperceptibly.  nThe next morning, when I arrived at her bedside to hear all about her trip, Dorothy bemoaned her poor form. “I simply wasn’t as sharp as usual,” she lamented.  nI raised an eyebrow. “To be fair, Dorothy, no one  around the table had the excuse that they were dying,” I observed. “Did anyone  seem to mind ”  nA mischievous grin, a twinkle in her eye, and then, finally, I was ­liberated from the dunce’s corner with the words: “Dr Clarke, it was magnicent.”  nA few days later, Dorothy died. Mr Edwards, it turned out, was wrong by only  hours, but in that time, how his patient lived.  n  n   nSimon  nSimon, a former policeman in his sixties, had retired a few months earlier. Shortly afterwards, he noticed a lump in his neck, painless, innocuous and perhaps, he had assumed, related to a recent head cold.  nThe lump continued to grow. Still more curious than concerned – he regularly ran  miles before breakfast – he visited his GP.  nThe speed of his referral to hospital impressed him, innocent of the fact he was on a two-week cancer pathway. The scan became a biopsy, the biopsy a consultant, murmuring cryptically about inoperability, as Simon sat stricken, pinned to his seat, hearing nothing of substance after “cancer”.  nI heard him before I set eyes on him. Specically, I heard the sound of air being sucked into his lungs through an airway severely compressed by a tumour.  nSimon was sitting bolt upright, eyes darting, his shirt ripped off and both hands gripping the bed like his le depended on it.  nBeside him stood a woman in her thirties, distraught and dishevelled, saying, “It’s OK, Dad. Look. Look, the doctor’s here. ­Everything’s going to be OK now.”  nSimon stared up at me, gulping for air. There was no way he could sustain this work of breathing. If, as I suspected, panic had exacerbated his airway obstruction, then I knew how to help.  nThe nurses brought the large dose of ­steroids that would, I hoped, begin to shrink the swelling in Simon’s neck. Next, a tiny dose of a fast-acting sedative, just enough to take the edge off his panic.  nI saw his daughter Sophie was crying. He began to describe living alone with cancer, having been widowed a few years previously. “It’s all been so quick. Too much to take in. Sophie,I’m honest, is my rock, but she has Timmy, her boy, to look after as well.”  n“Don’t be ridiculous, Dad,” Sophie ­interjected, almost angrily. “You know looking after you is no problem. We all love being with you, especially Timmy.”  nI broached the topic of the future. “Look, I’m not stupid,” he exclaimed. “I don’t have one, do I  This is it. I know what’s going on.”  nThere are moments in medicine when what you say next feels as pregnant with risk as a surgeon’s first incision. The right words, used wisely, can bridge the airiest expanse between you and your patient but,misjudged, may blow trust to pieces.  n“Simon, are you the kind of person who likes to discuss everything frankly,” I began, “or do you prefer to take things one day at a time, without speculating about the future ”  n“I already know I’m dying,” he responded. “What  could you possibly tell me ”  n“One of the things I’ve noticed working here, Simon, is how often patients feel unable to ask about the thing they’re most preoccupied with, which is what it’s going to be like when they die – and I wonder whether this is something you’d like to talk about ”  nI saw horror distort Sophie’s face, as though I’d trespassed somewhere no doctor should tread but her father,anything, looked relieved.  n“Go on,” he said cautiously.  n“OK...we tend to see the same patterns in people with cancer who are approaching the end of le. One of the first things many patients notice is losing their strength, their energy. I’m guessing you’re already aware of that ”  nA rueful roll of the eyes.  n“No kidding. I used to run marathons. Can’t even get up the stairs now.” “That loss of energy gradually worsens. You might find you need a nap most days, more than one, probably. Then, one day, you realise you’re sleeping more than you’re awake. It’s not painful or horrible, it’s just immensely frustrating. Patients can find it helps to try and plan in advance a bit, saving up their energy for the things that really matter.”  n“Like Timmy,” Simon ­interrupted. “I like to know when he’s visiting so I can have a sleep beforehand.”  n“I didn’t realise that, Dad,” said Sophie.  n“Well, I want to give him my best, don’t I  And I don’t want to lose a second with him.”  nSophie turned to me. “Timmy’s dad’s not around anymore, you see. Left when he was two. Only shows up around Christmas and birthdays. Dad’s more like his real father.”  n“I see,” I said slowly, computing the layers of loss. I went on. “Often, at the end, there aren’t any dramatic changes. That ­sleepiness continues. A patient finds they are sleeping nearly all of the time.  n“You stop feeling hungry and you don’t want to eat. You may stop feeling thirsty too. Then, one day, rather than sleeping, you slip into unconsciousness.  n“It’s not a distinction you are even aware of. Your brain is just more deeply unresponsive. Sometimes, I wonderthis is the body’s way of protecting the mind – you stop being afraid, you’re oblivious to it all.”  nSimon and Sophie were quietly crying.  n“How long do you think I have left ” he asked me directly.  n“I have no reason to think you are going to die today, Simon. I do think your time is short – weeks, not months, perhaps only very short weeks – but I would love to believe we can get you home for a bit,that’s what you would like.”  nSimon said nothing. The silence, though thick with emotion, was not strained. Finally, he raised his eyes and smiled.  n“OK. I will. Maybe I’ll get to my boy’s birthday too. Thank you, Rachel – I mean it.”  nWhen people askmy job is depressing, I reply that nothing could be further from the truth. All that is good in human nature – courage, compassion, our capacity to love – is here in its most distilled form.  n  nTop news stories from n   n nAdele  nAdele has spent the last three months of her le in an urban specialist cancer centre.  nIn all that time, she has not felt fresh air.

She has written a book called A Doctor’s Story of Love and Loss  where she talks about her experiences and the patients she has cared for nRachel Clarke is a palliative care doctor at Katharine House Hospice in Oxfordshire. nWhen patients are admitted, many are fearful of death. nBut Rachel and her colleagues are determined to help them live le to the full before they die. nIn a second moving extract from her book Dear Le: A Doctor’s Story of Love and Loss, she remembers some of the patients and their stories which will stay with her forever... nDorothy was admitted to the hospice on a Monday.  n“There is no point in spending time with me,” she declared on arrival. “I will be dead on Thursday.” n“What makes you think that ” I asked, intrigued. nWe must act now to save our hospices - or children will go without care  nHospice doctors heartbreaking description how cancer stole her dad bit by bit  nShe gave me the kind of lingering stare a teacher reserves for the classroom dunce, then explained: “Mr Edwards. The senior consultant on the surgical ward told me my bowels had stopped working and I would be dead in six days. That was on Friday. I have three days left.” nI knew the rudiments of Dorothy’s story. Admitted to AE with acute bowel ­obstruction. Given her age –  – an almost certainly terminal diagnosis. But at no stage was there mention of Thursday. n“I will concede I do not feel full of death,” Dorothy stated. “I feel full of le. Butyou don’t mind, I would rather be left alone. I have little time left and I would like to read my newspaper.” nRarely in my career had I been dismissed more magnicently. I hardly dared respond. n“Based on my medical assessment, I am not at all certain you’ll be dead on Thursday,” I told Dorothy. “If you had more time, is there any way you would like to spend it ” n“Were I not to be dead on Thursday, then I would certainly be playing bridge with my local group, as I have done every Thursday for the last two decades. But I can assure you I will be dying instead.” n“How about this,” I proposed. “We plan for bridge, unless death intervenes ” n“Young lady, I will humour youit makes you feel useful.” nA good day, for me, in the hospice, is one in which I feel we have helped someone die with comfort and dignity intact. nBut infinitely preferable are the days when we have helped a dying patient live – be that basking in a bath filled with insanely priced bubblebath, stroking the family Labrador, saying a rushed but no less momentous “I do” from a wheelchair decked in flowers in the hospice chapel, or watching gold finches gleam in the trees outside. nIn a ward where every patient has a terminal diagnosis, le, in all its loveliness, goes on. nOn Thursday morning, the nurses busied themselves with washing, sprucing, plumping and preening. When Dorothy finally emerged, dressed for her bridge trip, she could have been Boudica. nDesperately thin, her chariot a wheelchair, a pre-emptive dose of morphine in her veins, yet nonetheless sitting ramrod straight with crocodile handbag perched on her lap and an impeccably coordinated green tweed skirt, cashmere cardigan and court shoes. nFlushed with all the fuss and attention, Dorothy was, for that Thursday only, the queen of our ward – and she knew it. For a moment, our eyes met, and she nodded ­imperceptibly. nThe next morning, when I arrived at her bedside to hear all about her trip, Dorothy bemoaned her poor form. “I simply  nwasn’t as sharp as usual,” she lamented. nI raised an eyebrow. “To be fair, Dorothy, no one  around the table had the excuse that they were dying,” I observed. “Did anyone  seem to mind ” nA mischievous grin, a twinkle in her eye, and then, finally, I was ­liberated from the dunce’s corner with the words: “Dr Clarke, it was magnicent.” nA few days later, Dorothy died.

When patients are admitted, many are fearful of death. But Rachel and her colleagues are determined to help them live le to the full before they die. In a second moving extract from her book Dear Le: A Doctor’s Story of Love and Loss, she remembers some of the patients and their stories which will stay with her forever... Dorothy Dorothy was admitted to the hospice on a Monday. “There is no point in spending time with me,” she declared on arrival. “I will be dead on Thursday.” “What makes you think that ” I asked, intrigued. She gave me the kind of lingering stare a teacher reserves for the classroom dunce, then explained: “Mr Edwards. The senior consultant on the surgical ward told me my bowels had stopped working and I would be dead in six days. That was on Friday. I have three days left.” I knew the rudiments of Dorothy’s story. Admitted to AE with acute bowel ­obstruction. Given her age –  – an almost certainly terminal diagnosis. But at no stage was there mention of Thursday. “I will concede I do not feel full of death,” Dorothy stated. “I feel full of le. Butyou don’t mind, I would rather be left alone. I have little time left and I would like to read my newspaper.” Rarely in my career had I been dismissed more magnicently. I hardly dared respond. “Based on my medical assessment, I am not at all certain you’ll be dead on Thursday,” I told Dorothy. “If you had more time, is there any way you would like to spend it ”  “Were I not to be dead on Thursday, then I would certainly be playing bridge with my local group, as I have done every Thursday for the last two decades. But I can assure you I will be dying instead.” “How about this,” I proposed. “We plan for bridge, unless death intervenes ” “Young lady, I will humour youit makes you feel useful.” A good day, for me, in the hospice, is one in which I feel we have helped someone die with comfort and dignity intact. But infinitely preferable are the days when we have helped a dying patient live – be that basking in a bath filled with insanely priced bubblebath, stroking the family Labrador, saying a rushed but no less momentous “I do” from a wheelchair decked in flowers in the hospice chapel, or watching gold finches gleam in the trees outside. In a ward where every patient has a terminal diagnosis, le, in all its loveliness, goes on. On Thursday morning, the nurses busied themselves with washing, sprucing, plumping and preening. When Dorothy finally emerged, dressed for her bridge trip, she could have been Boudica. Desperately thin, her chariot a wheelchair, a pre-emptive dose of morphine in her veins, yet nonetheless sitting ramrod straight with crocodile handbag perched on her lap and an impeccably coordinated green tweed skirt, cashmere cardigan and court shoes. Flushed with all the fuss and attention, Dorothy was, for that Thursday only, the queen of our ward – and she knew it. For a moment, our eyes met, and she nodded ­imperceptibly.The next morning, when I arrived at her bedside to hear all about her trip, Dorothy bemoaned her poor form. “I simplywasn’t as sharp as usual,” she lamented.I raised an eyebrow. “To be fair, Dorothy, no one  around the table had the excuse that they were dying,” I observed. “Did anyone  seem to mind ” A mischievous grin, a twinkle in her eye, and then, finally, I was ­liberated from the dunce’s corner with the words: “Dr Clarke, it was magnicent.” A few days later, Dorothy died. Mr Edwards, it turned out, was wrong by only  hours, but in that time, how his patient lived.  Simon Simon, a former policeman in his sixties, had retired a few months earlier. Shortly afterwards, he noticed a lump in his neck, painless, innocuous and perhaps, he had assumed, related to a recent head cold. The lump continued to grow. Still more curious than concerned – he regularly ran  miles before breakfast – he visited his GP. The speed of his referral to hospital impressed him, innocent of the fact he was on a two-week cancer pathway. The scan became a biopsy, the biopsy a consultant, murmuring cryptically about inoperability, as Simon sat stricken, pinned to his seat, hearing nothing of substance after “cancer”. I heard him before I set eyes on him. Specically, I heard the sound of air being sucked into his lungs through an airway severely compressed by a tumour. Simon was sitting bolt upright, eyes darting, his shirt ripped off and both hands gripping the bed like his le depended on it. Beside him stood a woman in her thirties, distraught and dishevelled, saying, “It’s OK, Dad. Look. Look, the doctor’s here. ­Everything’s going to be OK now.” Simon stared up at me, gulping for air. There was no way he could sustain this work of breathing. If, as I suspected, panic had exacerbated his airway obstruction, then I knew how to help. The nurses brought the large dose of ­steroids that would, I hoped, begin to shrink the swelling in Simon’s neck. Next, a tiny dose of a fast-acting sedative, just enough to take the edge off his panic. I saw his daughter Sophie was crying. He began to describe living alone with cancer, having been widowed a few years previously. “It’s all been so quick. Too much to take in. Sophie,I’m honest, is my rock, but she has Timmy, her boy, to look after as well.” “Don’t be ridiculous, Dad,” Sophie ­interjected, almost angrily. “You know looking after you is no problem. We all love being with you, especially Timmy.” I broached the topic of the future. “Look, I’m not stupid,” he exclaimed. “I don’t have one, do I  This is it. I know what’s going on.” There are moments in medicine when what you say next feels as pregnant with risk as a surgeon’s first incision. The right words, used wisely, can bridge the airiest expanse between you and your patient but,misjudged, may blow trust to pieces. “Simon, are you the kind of person who likes to discuss everything frankly,” I began, “or do you prefer to take things one day at a time, without speculating about the future ” “I already know I’m dying,” he responded. “What  could you possibly tell me ” “One of the things I’ve noticed working here, Simon, is how often patients feel unable to ask about the thing they’re most preoccupied with, which is what it’s going to be like when they die – and I wonder whether this is something you’d like to talk about ” I saw horror distort Sophie’s face, as though I’d trespassed somewhere no doctor should tread but her father,anything, looked relieved. “Go on,” he said cautiously. “OK...we tend to see the same patterns in people with cancer who are approaching the end of le. One of the first things many patients notice is losing their strength, their energy. I’m guessing you’re already aware of that ” A rueful roll of the eyes. “No kidding. I used to run marathons. Can’t even get up the stairs now.” “That loss of energy gradually worsens. You might find you need a nap most days, more than one, probably. Then, one day, you realise you’re sleeping more than you’re awake. It’s not painful or horrible, it’s just immensely frustrating. Patients can find it helps to try and plan in advance a bit, saving up their energy for the things that really matter.” “Like Timmy,” Simon ­interrupted. “I like to know when he’s visiting so I can have a sleep beforehand.” “I didn’t realise that, Dad,” said Sophie. “Well, I want to give him my best, don’t I  And I don’t want to lose a second with him.” Sophie turned to me. “Timmy’s dad’s not around anymore, you see. Left when he was two. Only shows up around Christmas and birthdays. Dad’s more like his real father.” “I see,” I said slowly, computing the layers of loss. I went on. “Often, at the end, there aren’t any dramatic changes. That ­sleepiness continues. A patient finds they are sleeping nearly all of the time. “You stop feeling hungry and you don’t want to eat. You may stop feeling thirsty too. Then, one day, rather than sleeping, you slip into unconsciousness. “It’s not a distinction you are even aware of. Your brain is just more deeply unresponsive. Sometimes, I wonderthis is the body’s way of protecting the mind – you stop being afraid, you’re oblivious to it all.” Simon and Sophie were quietly crying. “How long do you think I have left ” he asked me directly. “I have no reason to think you are going to die today, Simon. I do think your time is short – weeks, not months, perhaps only very short weeks – but I would love to believe we can get you home for a bit,that’s what you would like.” Simon said nothing. The silence, though thick with emotion, was not strained. Finally, he raised his eyes and smiled. “OK. I will. Maybe I’ll get to my boy’s birthday too. Thank you, Rachel – I mean it.” When people askmy job is depressing, I reply that nothing could be further from the truth. All that is good in human nature – courage, compassion, our capacity to love – is here in its most distilled form.

Liam Maguire, , counts famous footballers and high-flying Dubai business men amongst his clients after launching his own business three years ago. Now, he earns big money cleaning, polishing and waxing cars, charge anywhere from £ to £, per job. But as Liam, from Rainhill, Merseyside, explains, itaposs more than just washing a few windows.Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, he said: It falls down to who has the greatest level of OCD but doing it safely to ensure no excess contact or damage is caused to the car, while at the same time using high grade products to ensure the best finish.Everyday car washes can cause scratches and damage. I’m the guy you call to fix what they’ve caused and also promise you serious satisfaction. But it hasnapost always been fast supercars and rich businessmen for Liam, who has had to work his way up the ladder. He said: I started Urban Valets off the back of my old job. I worked for a company in St Helens since leaving school. I started at  as the aposrag handapos and I eventually became the valeting bay manager at , in charge of people twice my age with double the years in experience. I was unfortunately made redundant.My boss kindly helped me with a van and then became Urban Valets.I still to this day have a great relationship with my old boss and I also maintain his cars.” But the gamble paid off and Liam is now doubling his turnover year-on-year whilst working with some of the most luxurious cars in the business. Liam said: My services range from £ up to thousands. My highest paid job was £, and it took me a week solid. That was on a McLaren S in Manchester for a client who deals in Bitcoin and banking.As for my high profile clients, I never aimed for such football players as my business aim is to impress people who know about cars. I mean that in a respect in which to prove I’m the best at my job. Liamaposs first high profile client was the Red Bull drt masters racers, which then caught the attention of serious-level insurance brokers, multi-business owners who own supercars such as McLarens, Lamborghinis and Ferraris. He said: My greatest achievement is working on the rarest and most expensive supercar that’s in the UK currently, a McLaren Senna. The price tag with upgrades costs around £.million. I’m the only detailer to ever touch one of these rare vehicles. The owner is from Dubai and personally requested me and another valeter to meet at the Birmingham NEC autosport car show and work on this vehicle. I also recently completed a week-long detail down in Essex on a rare show spec  BMW E i which has to be perfect as it is attending a show in Austria in May. I was down in Essex all expenses paid for a week for this, which means a lot to little old me from Merseyside.” Liam admits working with these high-level clients is aposnerve-rackingapos but says that he aposthrivesapos upon the moment and sees it as his apostime to shineapos. Liam said: I know I’m good, I believe in myself and every multi-millionaire I’ve ever met has been that impressed theyaposve sat and gave me advice and wisdom. Something money can’t buy I suppose, so that’s what I enjoy most about my job.With his reputation growing, almost as a by-product Liamaposs Instagram also rocketed.Nearly  people follow Urban Valet on Instagram, which Liam says is due to his bright personality. He said: My following grew massively on Instagram due to my attitude, I shined light on a boring industry and made it fun.  I simplied everything so people could be involved...I shared tips and hints on my Instagram posts and also allowed people to see me and my personality. So much so, that Liam even has people recognising him in the streets. He continued: I get people stopping me when shopping and eating out. Hey it’s urban valets”.

Andrea Sheardown, , was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, a rare form of cancer occurring in the bile ducts, in  - and doctors told her there was nothing they could do for her, giving her just six weeks to live. But the mum-of-two, from Sandbach, Cheshire, refused to give up and sought a second opinion - when surgeons agreed to operate, and removed a tumour the size of a pineapple. Although doctors have warned her the aggressive cancer couldat any time, Andrea has refused to let her diagnosis stop her from living her le - and has gone on to complete a series of adrenaline-filled challenges. And this week, she is flying to Nepal to hike to Everest base camp with her husband, Chris, , her  year old son, Sam, her sister and  other loyal friends who she calls Andreaaposs AMMF Army, to reach the Everest Base Camp, which can take up to  days of trekking. Since being diagnosed in , Andrea has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, completed the three peaks challenge and cycled from Vietnam to Cambodia with her daughter, Amelia, . Andrea said: Since I began fundraising in , Iaposve managed to raise £, for the charity. The doctors have warned me that the cancer could come back at anytime but Iaposm trying to stay positive. Giving up wasnapost an option for me, I wanted to see my children grow up, be there for their key milestones in le - I had to stay strong for my family. People canapost believe that I have managed to do some of these things but le is all about challenging yourself - itaposs something I teach my kids and thataposs why they always come along with me. Iaposm so lucky with the support Iaposve received from family, friends, local businesses and even complete strangers. In , Andrea began experiencing severe pain in her rib cage which lasted for - weeks before she decided to go to AE at her local hospital due to the serverity of the pain.  After being told it was just indigestion, Andrea, who owns a magazine advertising business, was fed up and demanded she be given tests to find out what the problem was. Andrea was given blood tests, which came back as all clear. She was then given an x-ray, which was the first step in diagnosing her with cholangiocarcinoma. The x-ray showed a mass on her liver and following a week of CT and MRI scans, she was told by the hospital that there was aposnothing they could doapos and she was given just weeks to live. Left with no options, Andrea and her husband, Chris, went to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for a second opinion where they decided to offer Andrea a leline in agreeing to carry out intense surgery to remove the tumour from her liver which ended up being the size of a small pineapple. Andrea said: It was fantastic that the hospital offered me this leline, but it was also the hard work of my dad who trawled the internet in search of anything he could find out about this deadly cancer. He was the one that found the wonderful AMMF cancer charity. This then led us to other specialists in the cholangiocarcinoma field.  They didnapost know whether I would survive the operation so I took a risk because I thought, itaposs either this or Iaposm not going to be around for much longer. Iaposm so glad I took the risk becauseI hadnapost, I would have died. Once the tumour was removed, the doctors told Andrea that there was no way of making sure the cancer had gone completely as bile duct cancer doesnapost show up in blood tests. The hospital didnapost think Andrea would be strong enough to survive chemotherapy at the the time, but she felt strongly this route needed to be explored further, so she decided to go down the private care route which is when she found the Christie Clinic in Manchester. Andrea underwent six months of intense chemotherapy which resulted in her becoming weak and extremely frail.  However, in November , Andrea took on her first challenge after completing her course of chemotherapy: the three peak challenge. Andrea climbed Ben Nevis, m, Scafell Pike m and Snowdon, m where she managed to reach the peak to everyoneaposs amazement. I felt like people had almost written me off - they would bring me flowers and I hated that because I always associated flowers with funerals. Just because you have cancer, it doesnapost mean you should give up on le and when I found the AMMF charity, I knew that I wanted to start doing fundraising events because they helped me so much and more awareness needs to be raised about this type of cancer. Itaposs one of the deadliest and there is currently no cure. After climbing the three peaks in order to raise money for the AMMF charity, Andrea climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in February  and then cycled from Vietnam to Cambodia in February . During this time, Andrea and her AMMF army managed to raise £, for the charity.  Now, after being given the all clear in October , Andrea, along with her husband, her son, sister and a group of friends are flying out to reach Everest Base Camp on Thursday. Throughout all my treatment I have lived by the mantra of keep taking those steps no matter how small, eventhey are baby steps just keep taking them. I had never even climbed a mountain when I first started challenging myself.

Lorraine Dyer, from Halesowen, West Mids, has child benefit paid directly into her bank account. But she and partner Gareth were shocked when they were told by HMRC they owed thousands back to the government due to commission he had received from his job as a recruitment consultant. A rule is in place whereby iniduals who earn more than £, have to pay back a certain amount of their child benefit in income tax. And earnings that tip them over the threshold can come from money earned as commission, overtime, bonuses or even a company car allowance. Gareth works as a recruitment consultant and didn’t realise that his commission had tipped him over the edge, Lorraine, who runs Mini First Aid classes, told Birmingham Live. “It’s the fact it came out of the blue that was so annoying,we had known we would have cancelled immediately! she said.

The diagnosis comes a week after five others, including a nine-year-old child, who stayed at Contamines-Montjoie near Mont Blanc tested positive for the killer virus. Scout leader Steve Walsh, , dubbed the super-spreader, picked up the disease at a Singapore conference at the end of last month before he stopped at the resort for a few days to stay with his friends. He laterto his his home in Hove, East Sussex. The infected child is the son of British couple Bob and Catriona Saynor, who moved to the Alps three years ago, who also picked up the virus. Nine people in Britain are known to have contracted the illness but eight of those have since been discharged. Two Labour MPs temporarily self-isolated after they attended the same conference as a sufferer however they were then reminded that the risk was low and ended their isolation.Alex Sobel cancelled all events for almost a week after he was among  delegates at a bus conference in Londonaposs QEII conference centre.Lilian Greenwood, also cancelled all her events for a week. Neither of the MPs are feeling unwell but said they acted as a precaution.

Scientist Professor Neil Ferguson, of the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, told Channel : This virus is the one which probably concerns me the most out of everything Iaposve worked on.  Asked about concerns that % of the population could contract coronavirus, he said: Given how transmissible this virus appears to be and that fact that at least all adults can be infected, we have much less data in children, then % is a reasonable figure. Within the first  months or so. What we don’t know at the moment iseverybody infected. What proportion might die and what are the risk groups  Our best estimates at the moment is that maybe % of people who get infected might die.

Two bodies were pulled from rough seas on Saturday before the worst of the storm hit.One man was found following a huge search operation off Margate after an early-morning distress call, while another was found at Herne Bay. Leboats and the coastguard helicopter had been scouring the sea near Margate Harbour after reports of a man overboard, HM Coastguard said. In the other incident, Kent Police were called at .pm on Saturday to a report a person had been pulled from the sea in Herne Bay. The US National Weather Serviceaposs Ocean Prediction Centre reported winds up to mph and waves that could reach more than fthigh across the North Atlantic. Forecasters were expecting winds to reach mph along coastlines, while some parts of the country could witness up to .inof rain. Experts have warned that conditions amount to a perfect storm, with hundreds of homes at risk of flooding.The Met Office has issued eight weather warnings covering most of the UK this weekend.This includes amber warnings from midday on Saturday over southern Scotland, northern England, Wales and part of the South West saying that flooding could cause a danger to le.Thousands of travellers have had their flights grounded for safety reasons, with British Airways and easyJet confirming cancellations. More than  easyJet flights in and out of the UK on Saturday have been cancelled, while sports fans discovered several fixtures were also called off due to the weather. Residents in West Yorkshire, which was badly hit by flooding during last weekendaposs Storm Ciara, are being helped by British Army personnel sent out by the Ministry of Defence . A spokesman for British Airways said they are merging a small number of Heathrow short-haul flights to the same destination and using larger aircraft where possible to minimise disruption, while a spokeswoman for easyJet confirmed  cancellations. Ryanair said all its flights are operating as normal.A spokeswoman for Heathrow Airport said: To minimise the number of flights cancelled at short notice we have taken the joint decision, alongside our airline and air traffic partners, to pre-emptively consolidate todayaposs schedule. A spokesman for Luton Airport said the airport is fully operational, but added that a number of cancellations are expected later on Saturday. The MoD said  personnel from th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, will be aiding the Environment Agencyin constructing barriers and repairing flood defences in Ilkley and Calderdale, while  Reservists from th Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, have also been tasked with providing support where required. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: Our armed forces are always ready to support local authorities and communities whenever they need it. The rapid response of the Army today will help with provision of flood relief to local communities in West Yorkshire. The EA said flooding is likely to be worse than under last weekendaposs Storm Ciara due to rain falling on already saturated ground. In England alone,  properties were left flooded when Storm Ciara struck, the EA said. North Wales Police said very high winds had led to debris and branches falling off trees and Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said it had rescued a motorist from a car stuck in flood water in the Liskeard area. Power cuts are also expected and there is a good chance that train and buses will see cancellations or delays and roads closed. The Met Office said the main areas of concern on Saturday are north and south-west England and Wales, with the South East bearing the brunt more on Sunday. At just after pm on Saturday, there were  flood warnings - meaning flooding is expected - and more than  flood alerts - meaning flooding is possible - in places across the country. Flood defences are due to be in operation this weekend, with additional temporary flood barriers being installed in Shropshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Surrey. More than  staff are on active incident duty and  mobile pumps have been deployed, the EA said.

for peanut butter and other human snacks saw his weight balloon - but he doesnt look impressed with his new dietShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  FEB NewsHe always used to flash a smile

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA labrador has replaced his signature smile with a frown after being forced to cut out his favourite human snacks - but his owner insists heaposs very happy with his new bod. Hilarious before and after photos of Miller the dog has seen a dramatic change in his expression after shedding almost a quarter of his bodyweight. Despite previously tipping the scales at a whopping kg - almost kg over a healthy weight for his breed - he always appeared jolly with a belly full of peanut butter. Milleraposs enthusiasm for snacks proved to be his downfall after he gobbled down a beer holder, requiring surgery. Owner Jackie Hensley took him for surgery to have it removed in Illinois and a vet revealed that Miller would need to lose weight to alleviate stress of the stitches and improve his general health. The bombshell news meant his favourite peanut butter was out, replaced by longer walks and lower calorie dog food, seeing him drop kg in nine months. The impressive achievement has been celebrated by everyone, except, it appears, Miller himself, who now wears a constant scowl - with Jackie admitting he looks aposa bit sadapos as heaposs no longer enjoying so many treats. Jackie, a photographer, said: Miller was a happy dog at his large and in charge size. And we all love our treats, so itaposs understandable he looks a bit sad.  He may not look it, but he is a happier boy now. The main thing they mention is how it is harder on his joints to carry around that extra weight and can hurt him later in le. Plus, itaposs a lot nicer when he decides to jump on me and not knock me over. Hungry Miller was previously always snacking off the floor but it was after his second surgerythat Jackie was told his weight would increase the risk of the operation. Milleraposs tubby tum was the result of a daily diet which saw him wolf down four cups of dog food and plenty of human snacks in between.  Jackie said: His favourite was peanut butter, he would do anything for it. After the surgery we became very determined to get him healthy. We switched his food to a light version and cut the quantity he had across the day in half. We also swapped his snacks to carrots and now he has learned to love them as a treat. As well as a strict diet, Milleraposs exercise doubled to a daily  minute walk, with some fetch mixed in.

Paul Hartley played him further back in front of me and whoever I was partnering but I always felt he was more of a threat further up the pitch.“He creates real problems for defenders because they don’t know whether to follow him when he naturally drops back.“What Gowser does is take real care of the ball when he’s got it and he turns and can see a pass.“The ball he played through for Kane Hemmings’ second goal had to be right and he set the goal up.“I was delighted with Gowser up front and with Kane next to him.”With striking options limited following Danny Johnson’s departure in January and Andrew Nelson’s surgery, James says that plan would have been put to use the previous week against Morton.However, a knock picked up in training ruled McGowan out of the draw at Cappielow.And it was sporting director Gordon Strachan who reminded the Dark Blues manager of the possibility.McGowan started his career at Celtic while Strachan was manager at Parkhead and was given his debut in an advanced position.James added: “It’s something we would have done earlierwe could have.“We probably would have done it at Morton.“He started his career out there. That’s what Gordon keeps saying to me.“He played there when Gordon was at Celtic.“Gordon gave him his debut. He played in the Champions League for him against Villareal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dens gaffer players have to pay back dundee fans","story":"Dundee boss James McPake expects his players to give the club’s fans something back in the last few months of the season as they target a second-place finish.It’s been a trying first season as a manager for the -year-old at Dens Park with form and fortunes of his side fluctuating from week to week.After two positive results in their last two outings – a - draw at Cappielow against Morton followed up by a commanding - success over bottom side Partick Thistle – the Dark Blues gaffer is hard at work trying to stretch those reults into an extended run of form that can see Dundee earn themselves a place in the end-of-season play-offs.At times, the club’s fans have voiced their frustration at the team’s inability to prove any sort of challenge to runaway leaders Dundee United.James understands that but was pleased to see another side to the home support in last weekend’s win over the Jags.“We gave them a reason to get behind us,” he said.“Early in the game, Kane Hemmings chased a ball down, it rebounds off the defender and we get a throw-in – everybody is buzzing just because Kano chased a ball.“The supporters are then up for it and they see the players are up for it, too, with balls into the box early on.”That was a prime example of the players getting the crowd onside and the manager is demanding more of that, particularly with four home games coming up in the six matches after next Saturday’s trip to Queen of the South.Arbroath and Alloa are a home double-header before Dunfermline and then Queens check in to Dens before the end of March.“We have to give them something to be proud of – I said as much in my first interview,” he added.“I think last Saturday the fans were proud of their team.“We might not have knocked the ball about or played as fluently as we have this season but we got the three points and came away with a clean sheet and looked really comfortable.“The fans will have walked away really happy.“I think that was probably the first time at Dens this season where they walked away saying ‘it was good today’.“We have to do that, it has to come from us.“The fans will help us when it’s backs to the wall but we need to give them something.“Last Saturday we did.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e184ad61963d8.69056156.jpg ","title":"forster happy to swap goal for clean sheet","story":"Jordon Forster admits he hasn’t dealt well with being out of the Dundee team but is delighted to have made a positive impact on his– evenhe’s had to begrudgingly give up claims for a first goal of the season.The big centre-back was taken out of the firing line back in December after a costly error against Queen of the South and a dficult day at the back in the following home match against Dunfermline.But he has responded with two strong performances that have helped the Dark Blues pick up four points from their last two matches with a draw at Morton followed up by Saturday’s - win over Partick Thistle.Speaking to the Tele, Forster admits his time out of the team hasn’t been the easiest.He said: “I was on the bench for a few games.“It was dficult to deal with and, being honest, I don’t deal with that very well!“It’s the manager’s decision at the end of the day.“I hope I’ve shown enough to remain in the team for the next game.“It’s part and parcel of football, the boys who came in have done well.“It is a team game, at the end of the day, we have a squad for the whole season and every single one in the squad is important.“As long as the team is doing well, it’s all good.”With the score at -, Forster thought he’d opened his scoring account for the Dark Blues as he powered a header goalwards only to see striker Kane Hemmings knock the ball over the line.“First goal of the season, yeah!” said Forster.“To be fair, Kane got the last touch on it. It was going in but Kane is a good striker and good strikers make sure –he wants the goal, he can have it!“The main thing was to get the win and a clean sheet as well – I would trade the goal for a clean sheet, to be honest.”Saturday’s shutout was Dundee’s first since they last met the Jags on December  and their first at Dens since October .“We got a lot of clean sheets at the start of the season and I think we came away from basing our game on that,” added Forster.“It’s nice to be back in the team, not quite scoring, but helping us get three points.“It was a blustery day and conditions on the pitch weren’t brilliant.“I think we made the best of it and got the best possible outcome.“The boys played well, we were really dficult to beat and we made a big thing of getting to second balls and closing people down.“We worked harder than we have been – that can be a hard thing to say to players but I think it has showed in the last couple of games where we have really got after teams and put them under pressure.

to league leaders Celtic at Pittodrie.It was a third successive home defeat for Aberdeen but Derek McInnes# side were unfortunate not to take at least a point from a game where they more than matched the defending Premiership champions.Boss McInnes will hope the performance, albeit not the result, can be a catalyst to kick-start the campaign especially with the Scottish Cup replay against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park looming on Wednesday.Celtic grabbed an early lead through Callum McGregor before Aberdeen hit back with a superb volley from Ash Taylor.The Hoops secured the point with a late winner from Kristoffer Ajer.Two changes were made to the Aberdeen starting line-up that defeated Hamilton - away on Tuesday.Having suffered a groin strain whilst training on Friday Mikey Devlin dropped out.Fellow centre-back Ash Taylor came through a fitness test at training on the eve of the game and went into the starting XI having missed the previous two matches with a calf inury.Shay Logan ed and went into a three man back-line with midfielder Dylan McGeouch dropping to the bench.Celtic grabbed the lead in the th minute when Leigh Grfiths dispossessed  Scott McKenna before passing into the box to Odsonne Edouard who rolled the ball to James Forrest.Keeper Joe Lewis blocked Forrest#s right foot drive but Callum McGREGOR pounded on the loose ball to fire home from with his right foot from  yards.It was a bitter blow for Aberdeen who had began well.The Reds completely collapsed when losing four goals in the first half in losing - to Celtic in the last clash at Pittodrie in October.It was vital they show composure in the aftermath of this early goal.In the nd minute Aberdeen threatened when a powerful tackle from Ash Taylor sent the ball spinning upfield.Striker Curtis Main collected the ball and fired a  yard shot but it rose high above keeper Fraser Forster#s goal.Celtic were hit by an injury blow in the th minute when defender Greg Taylor was forAberdeen equalized in the th minute with a superb finish from TAYLOR.A cross from Connor McLennan on the right eluded the Hoops# defence and fell to Taylor who chested the ball to kill the momentum, waited for it to drop then smashed a superb half volley beyond Forster.Aberdeen deserved the equalizer.In the th minute Funso Ojo fired in a  yard low drive that keeper Forster moved in the air and Forster batted the ball in front of him.Niall McGinn raced onto the loose ball and headed into the side netting.Moments later Connor McLennan went down in the box but referee Andrew Dallas booked him for simulation.In the th minute Main raced in on goal and fired in a  yard drive that Forster saved at his near post.In the th minute McGinn delivered a superb cross from deep on the left flank and Main was agonisingly short of connecting in front of goal.Moments later substitute Jonny Hayes burst in on goal but keeper Lewis raced off his line to charge down his powerful  yard drive.Celtic went ahead in the st minute when Forrest attacked the Aberdeen box on the left before rolling a pass to Kristoffer AJER who was left completely unmarked and allowed the time to smash it beyond Lewis from  yards.Ajer then celebrated the goal in front of the Aberdeen supporters in the South Stand.  He should have been booked but referee Dallas let it slide.It was a bitter blow for Aberdeen who had put so much into the game.It was compounded when midfielder Funso Ojo had to come off injured, replaced by Cosgrove.It should have been -

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Their health suffers and the prospect of developing economically remains out of reach. For women and young girls, the consequences can be even worse, with many being attacked and raped when they use outdoor spaces.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations.

We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

Smith added that Watson had taken Valium at a friendrsquos home earlier that evening and now ldquoaccepts she was unfit to drive the vehicle.The brief said that Watson was a care worker and was

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/11032472.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

The consequence is a cabinet full of cartoon characters, which is just as Mr Cummings wants it.\"It is always telling when a prime minister goes out of his way to appoint the C-team. One of the temperamental traits that will make Mr Johnson a weak premier is that, like many people prone to displays of bravura, he is tormented by the fear that he is not up to the job.\"The ScotsmanThe papers editorial suggests there are worrying signs for One-Nation Tories.It said: \"There are rumours that tensions between Cummings and Sajid Javid led to the Chancellors shock resignation, just four weeks before the UK Budget. Sources claimed Javid had refused to fire his own special advisers and replace them with ones sent from Number .\"The papers editorial goes on to mention other high profile departures including Andrea Leadsom, Geoffrey Cox and Julian Smith.It added: \"The concern about such changes is that they suggest Johnson is no longer the One Nation Tory that he has been in the past and that he is demanding loyalty to an excessive degree - a sign of weakness, not strength. Members of the Cabinet should be signed up to broad policy objectives, but they should not fear losing their jobsthey have specic disagreements with the boss.\"And, to be clear, that boss is Johnson, not Cummings, and the buck stops with him.\"Polly Toynbee writes in her column that \"this revenge reshuffle shows absolute power resides in No .\"She said: \"The message of this reshuffle is a nasty and dangerous one: absolute power resides in just one place, No .The Treasury, which strove to protect the nations finances against the worst damages of Brexit, is a diminished force - for now. Attempts to thwart Johnsons reckless plans - whether branded super-bridges or Brexit vanity projects - will be overridden. If Whitehall joked that Javid was \"chino\" - chancellor in name only- his successor can expect even less respect.\"Although the power of Cummings now seems unprecedented, seasoned observers are waiting for him to overstep the mark. No one is indispensable, a truism of prime ministerial power. The prime minister will be quick to jettison anyone imperilling his popularity, including his svengali.\""},{"url":null,"title":"radical-gaelic-campaign-group-reveals-plans-stand-raft-local-election-candidates","story":"Misneachd ndash which translates as confidence or courage ndash says all adults in the Western Isles and other Gaelic heartlands should have the right to six monthsrsquo free, full-time tuition in the language in islands-based ldquoimmersion centres.This would take the form of a paid sabbatical for those in work.It also wants to phase out English-medium education in the islands and limit the number of second homes.Misneachd is fielding a candidate for the first time in a local by-election on Skye on March , following the resignation of independent councillor Professor Ronald MacDonald from Highland Council.:Alan Simpson: It is time to rip up the Gaelic blueprint and start againMagravertainn Mac a Bhagraveillidh, the grouprsquos candidate, told the Herald on Sunday: \"I think in the next council elections we want to have a raft of candidates standing in the islands, again as independents but with an affiliationto the Misneachd agenda as it were, rather than as an official political party.\"Its just very hard to challenge the status quo in terms of language policies.

The deeply traditional monks rise at am, eat in silence, even wash dishes to the sound of Latin hymns.They dress in identical ankle- black habits, shun possessions and retire to a small, basic cells with just a bed, a desk and a toilet.Monastic le ndash apart from their regularly updated blog and occasional YouTube video ndash has barely changed since the early monks of Papa Stronsay repelled Viking invaders who dared to interrupt their precious way of le.Work to create new accommodation to meet demand is expected to be carried out by hand by the monks, who have already transformed a former herring gutting shed into a chapel, and who rely on a small private vessel to link them to the nearest island, Stronsay.With no connection to the National Grid and just a generator to provide power, the monks also have plans to enter the modern age and install wind turbines on the island and to explore other forms of renewable energy.ldquoWe have seen the number of retreat requests increase signicantly over the years, says Fr Magdala Maria, rector at Papa Stronsay, which means \"priestsrsquo island of Stronsay\".ldquoThere is a plan for a church to be built. There will be larger facilities to cater for a larger number of retreatants.In addition to soaring interest from people seeking to spend time in retreat with the monks, the monastery also appears to be a magnet for tourists seeking to explore their remote island.ldquoThere are dferent types of visitors they who specically come to the monastery for some time away, spiritual retreats or peace and quiet. We receive our fair share of visitors as well from the curious, to those who are interested in historic sites, to those who come for religious reasons, he adds.ldquoWe are always receiving requests for visits even in the windy winter months in Orkney.Attractions for visitors to Papa Stronsay include Earlrsquos Knowle, the longest chambered cairn in the UK, the remains of th century St Nicolasrsquos Chapel, and a rare and perplexing duo of kelp-burning kilns connected by tunnels.The Transalpine Redemptorists, also known as The Congregation of the Sons of The Most Holy Redeemer, formed in  in order to continue the tradition of celebrating Latin mass. They bought Papa Stronsay  years later for around pound,.Old herring industry buildings were converted to become a refectory and chapel, and a row of cells were built containing simple furnishings to accommodate up to  monks.Fr. Magdala Maria adds: ldquoWe have a steady number of young men joining which is always encouraging to see, so the future seems secure.Any rise in visitors and interest in Papa Stronsay is likely to be welcomed by the  islanders of Stronsay, just six minutes away by boat, where efforts have been under way for the past two years to lure more tourists.The seven-mile-long island, known as \"Orkneyrsquos Island of Bays\", currently attracts around  tourists a year to its rugged coastline, dramatic seascapes, sheltered beaches and history ndash flint arrowheads believed to be , years old have been found on the island.However, reaching Stronsay can be challenging: the five-times-a-week flight from Kirkwall to Stronsay takes just eight minutes, but spaces are limited the ferry may be cheaper but itrsquos an hour and a half just to get there.Reaching the monastery at Papa Stronsay means calling ahead and arranging for a boat.ldquoStronsay has put in quite an effort to lt its profile both as a holiday destination and somewhere to live and work. As well as housing and better ferry services, we need employment, says Stronsay-born and bred North Isles councillor Graham Sinclair.ldquoWhat holds tourism back is the lack of Scottish Government funding for a better ferry service. Itrsquos woefully poor compared to the Western Isles.Fresh hope has come from a controversial source: in October, go-ahead was given by Orkney Islands Council for two new fish farms ndash the first in the Stronsay area.Located in two of the islandrsquos three large sandy bays, they will occupy picturesque spots where grey seals, harbour seals, otters and other wildle currently thrive undisturbed.The Mill Bay and Bay of Holland fish farms will each comprise  circular cages, each  metres in circumference and both serviced by their own -tonne feed barge.Cooke Aquaculturersquos new farms will create up to nine jobs ndash however, some have questioned the impact on seals, fish stocks, crab and lobster, as well as expressing fears about the potential visual scar on the unspoiled landscape.However, Cllr Sinclair says the farms are largely welcomed: ldquoTherersquos a buzz on the island just now. The fish farms are in development stage, and thatrsquos brought a buzz over the prospect of new jobs in a small community.Fish have always played a role in the islandsrsquo industry: Papa Stronsay was once a centre for the herring industry, and at its height in the s, up to  people lived and worked there.At peak times, so many herring boats packed into the Sound of Papa that it was possible to walk across the boats from Stronsay to Papa Stronsay without touching the water.The fishing industry collapsed after the Second World War and native islanders left. Today, around % of Stronsayrsquos population is said to be made up of non-native Orcadians.According to Fr. Magdala Maria, a rise in visitors to the two islands would not adversely affect their peaceful solitude.ldquoWe are not concerned about an increase of tourism, in fact we welcome it, he says.ldquoOne can say that we have contributed to the influx of visitors to the island of Stronsay over the years. Many of our family members and friends have visited from all over the world, being an international community of monks.ldquoWe always encourage visitors to our island.ldquoAt the same time we want to keep our treasure, Papa Stronsay, a place of joyful silence and solitude, where people can come here to enjoy peace, tranquility and experience the presence of God."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-film-festival-one-mans-journey-depth-despair-top-world","story":"Standing on the top of the world with Everest under his feet and a dark, disturbing secret embedded in his heart, David Tait felt a kind of euphoria wash over him.Getting there had taken years of chaos and destructive behaviour.

I realised I had found something.On the ,ft summit, years of suppressing the horrors of his childhood lted.Tait, a successful City trader and top banker with Credit Suisse who had already quietly resolved to turn those awful childhood experiences into a force for good, vowed to take the next step and share his distressing yet powerful story.Now a harrowing but uplting film that depicts how he overcame a childhood blighted by sexual predators and which scarred his journey into adulthood will receive its world premiere at Glasgow Film Festival.Sulphur And White, which stars Anna Friel as Taitrsquos broken mother and Fe-born actor Dougray Scott as his cruel father, throws light on the deeply distressing impact of child sex abuse and the ripple effect that shatters the lives of not only its young victims but those around them too.Using flashback sequences, it links years of abuse and suppressed hurt with Taitrsquos subsequent destructive and self-indulgent behaviour which triggered the breakdown of his first marriage and two suicide attempts.Although it is deeply disturbing, Tait says he is hopeful the film will encourage debate over the far-reaching impacts of child abuse, and help lt the stigma that may discourage victims from seeking support and avoid a descent into a troubled adulthood.ldquoIrsquod like the film to be a defining moment in recognising that the victim also creates many, he says, adding: ldquoThere are animals out there and all we can do is try to protect children.His ordeal began when he was just  years old while working for a relative in a tearoom in Deptford Park, south London. Caught pinching a chocolate bar, Taitrsquos punishment was to be brutally raped and warned not to tell.The assaults continued for an entire summer and included episodes involving groups of men, with the youngsterrsquos head covered with a sack to protect the identities of his attackers. Later, Tait was subjected to abuse from his own father.The film explores how that abuse affected his adult relationships and how, having been driven to the brink, he pulled back from taking his own le and resolved to stop allowing events of the past to dictate his behaviour.He went on to climb Everest five times and raise pound. million for childrenrsquos charity NSPCC, which supports young victims of abuse.Of the film, he says: ldquoI realised there was a chance to do three things. The first was to educate those who donrsquot understand what sexual abuse of children is. I know some remarkably clever people who, when they saw the film, turned to me and said they didnrsquot understand that went on. I thought everyone did.ldquoSecondly, therersquos a lot of collateral damage created by the victim ndash me. Over the years I have created so much mayhem. I want to destigmatise it, talk about [abuse] and bring it out into the open.ldquoThirdly, there was no NSPCC for me. And I hope the film will show that children donrsquot have to go through  or  years of misery before getting help.Tait, , first decided to speak openly of his childhood experiences as he prepared for his second Everest climb, signing off an email calling for support towards his fundraising for the NSPCC with the line: ldquoBecause I was one of those kids.His last Everest expedition in  almost ended in tragedy when he was caught in an avalanche.Sulphur And White is among nine world premieres at the -day film festival. Others include Flint, from Scotland-based director Anthony Baxter, which unravels scandalous betrayal and hypocrisy around Michiganrsquos water supply, and Pictures From Afghanistan which follows The Herald and The Herald on Sunday photojournalist David Pratt as he s to the country.More than  films will make their UK debut, among them Edinburgh-based Mark Cousinsrsquo -hour documentary Women Make Film, a tribute to women filmmakers which will be screened in five instalments, and Dirt Music starring Kelly Macdonald as an Australian outback we trapped in a miserable marriage.The festival closes on International Womenrsquos Day with every film screened that day either directed or written by a woman, or featuring a female lead.Mark Stanley, who played Grenn in the HBO series Game Of Thrones, and who portrays Tait in the film, and co-star Emily Beecham, who plays his we, Vanessa, and who last year won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for her part in Little Joe, are lined up to attend the world premiere of Sulphur And White.The film tackles the complicated relationship between Tait and his mother, and explores how the support of his we and birth of his children brought new focus into his le.ldquoI feel dferent almost every time I see it, he says of the film. ldquoThere are one or two points regarding my mother that are devastating ndash two scenes leave me helpless every time I watch them.ldquoIt was probably harder for me to read the script than to watch the film.

University researchers will explore the history of islands such as Coll and Tiree, Barra, Benbecula, Skye and Raasay as well as mainland sites such as Glen Coe, Lochaber and Wester Ross.They are looking for tales handed down the generations, such as those from the Clearances, when many of these areas were denuded of the communities which had been their leblood.Mass migration of Scots from the islands and crofts of Argyll and beyond to the New World will also be recorded, as will the myths and legends handed down from the ancient days when the west was the domain of the Vikings.Famous sons and daughters of these lands and the achievements they made during their lives both at home and abroad will also be featured.The project is run by the West Highland College UHIrsquos Centre for Recreation and Tourism Research , which was recently awarded a grant worth pound, from the Scottish Natural HeritageNatural and Cultural Heritage Fund.The centre has also secured match funding from the college itself and Caledonian MacBrayne , giving a budget of more than pound,.Sara Bellshaw, senior innovation manager at CRTR, said that it would help prevent folk memories and tales ignored by wider history from being lost forever.She said: ldquoIt is fantastic to have received this funding from the Natural and Cultural Heritage Fund and the additional match funding from WHC UHI and CalMac. There is a plethora of stories to be told and interpreted linked to the cultural heritage and spread of communities across the west coast, directly related to the maritime environment.ldquoThe project will create a repository of important and influential narratives, helping to both keep these important oral, written and visual artefacts alive and to unearth hidden lsquogemsrsquo that risk being lost.ldquoMany of the areas share story themes, from Gaelic language and culture, to Viking trading posts, world-famous inventors, and departure points for mass emigration.ldquoMaterials will be collected that help tell each story including music, film, imagery, artwork, augmented reality, and prose.She added: ldquoSharing these stories will help visitors understand the culture and traditions of local le and what has made the place and community they are visiting what it is today. Combining these stories with practical visitor information aims to enhance the visitor experience along the west coast.ldquoCollaborating with communities, West Coast Waters, local destination organisations and industry experts is integral to this project, and we also plan to involve students wherever possible, including the Marine and Coastal Tourism students who are part of the School of Adventure Studies here at West Highland College UHI.The project is part of a new pound million Scottish programme of projects to invest in the Highlands and Islands to provide more high-quality opportunities for visitors to enjoy natural and cultural heritage assets.The Coast That Shaped The World is a community-led scheme, and people who live on the islands, and in towns and villages on the west coast, will be directly involved.A website and app with augmented and virtual reality will be developed to accompany the exhibitions, while maritime heritage stories will be brought to le through GPS triggers at the site of the events they talk about, to give people a tangible reference to the land and sea where everything unfolded.Led by the Centre for Recreation and Tourism Research, The Coast that Shaped the World is a large-scale collaboration between West Highland College UHI and the West Coast Waters tourism initiative.West Coast Waters is a collaboration of  west coast destinations and tourism organisations collectively representing over , tourism interests across the west coast of Scotland.

Wider improvements to the local network will result in more and better services between Inverness and Aberdeen, which mobility impaired users will not be able to use to their full advantage.“Not only is there a strong desire within the community for future improvements to be made, the consultation has suggested that the station would be used more frequentlyaccessibility was improved.”Although many stations across Scotland suffer from accessibility issues, Insch presents a unique case in that users would have to travel at least km to reach an alternative partly accessible station, or travel to Dyce for a fully accessible station. In that regard, Insch is considered one of the least accessible stations in Scotland.A number of options have been generated to improve accessibility at Insch.Transport Scotland has been asked to approve the Initial appraisal report, before the options identied are taken forward for more detailed consideration.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Louisa McKay, who runs King Edward-based Field Yoga\"  Get healthy at yoga and vegan workshopviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"This Land Rover Discovery TDV Commercial Auto sold for #,\"  Vehicles are in demand at Thainstone viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"charity sculpture unveiled at holyrood","story":"A north-east charity took part in an annual reception at Holyrood recently, as part of the year of coasts and waters.CLAN Cancer Support was invited to take part in the prestigious reception by VisitScotland, which was launching its initiative to celebrate Scotland’s coastal landscape at Holyrood on Wednesday, January .CLAN’s senior management team attended the reception to showcase its Light the North campaign, a lighthouse themed education and art programme.The reception took place in the Garden Lobby at the Scottish Parliament, and was attended by Stuart McMillan, MSP, Fiona Hyslop MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs and John Thurso, Chairman of VisitScotland.At the reception, CLAN was able to present its ft high lighthouse sculpture, which is the first of a series of  sculptures which will be placed across Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Moray, Orkney and Shetland to form a trail for visitors and locals alike.The lighthouse, which was transported from Aberdeen to Edinburgh by Light the North haulage sponsor Colin Lawson Transport, was recently decorated at CLAN House in Aberdeen by local artist Katie Guthrie.Light the North is a unique celebratory art sculpture trail which will see over  lighthouses designed and created by some of the area’s most talented artists.The trail, which will take place in Autumn , will raise signicant funds for and awareness of the vital support provided by CLAN.

However, Steve’s natural talent and drive quickly meant that they were expanding and moved into Inverurie.Not long after the move Steve and Jim amicably parted ways leaving Steve as the sole proprietor of IK. Branching out and running the business on his own, Steve was never one to shy away from risks.As well as his ability to grab an opportunity with both hands, a critical aspect of Steve, and therefore, IK Motor’s success, is his commitment to going the extra mile for the customer.Steve commented: “Ultimately, it’s all about giving the customer a good deal, and letting them know that they can always count on us to come through for them. Our interest in the customer doesn’t end when they purchase a vehicle, we make sure they get good service afterwards.” This commitment to customers extends to the wider community at large, with Steve always making the effort to give back and ensure that Inverurie shares in IK’s success. He said: “In Inverurie there is a particularly strong sense of community. Even though it’s expanded considerably, that sense of cohesion is still there, and we love to be a part of that.“Every year we try and do what we can to give something back. On our th anniversary we raised over £, for CLAN. Last August, we organised a ball at Meldrum house and raised over £, for Macmillan Cancer Support.”“We support local football teams and local sports in general, but I can’t take sole credit for what we do, without the support of my family, friends, the business, and the people in and around the town it wouldn’t be possible.” data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Storm Ciara damage.\"  Storm Ciara:  of the most shocking photos of the damage flooding left in its wake viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Looking to the future, Steve shows no signs of slowing down having recently entered the property development sector and is near completion of a new build facility for international supplier screw fix, with a number of other projects in the pipeline."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie auctioneer join iaas","story":"An auctioneer from Inverurie has been welcomed to the Institute of Auctioneers and Appraisers in Scotland .Ellis Mutch is one of six Scottish students in year three of the Livestock Market Operations and Management course at Harper Adams University in Shropshire and was presented with his associate membership certicate by IAAS President Scott Donaldson.The certicate in higher education he is working towards is seen as the professional standard for entry into the livestock auctioneering sector.

Daniel Bingham, senior pets buyer for Wilko, offered some advice on helping wild birds thrive during the colder season.He said: “Birds feed every day and don’t store energy well, so one or two bad days in cold weather or without food can be very dangerous for them.“Put out a good selection of food in feeders or on tables to attract birds to your garden — things like fat balls are nutritious and high in energy — perfect to help them maintain weight and stay fuelled.“Put some soft food down for the songbirds who can’t reach the feeders. Suet blocks and pellets work particularly well, as they give the birds a great energy boost and plenty of calories.“Don’t forget to provide fresh water. Ponds, puddles and other water sources may freeze over, making them inaccessible to birds. Birds can be timid so you’ll need to be patient build up trust by sharing plenty of treats and you could soon be rewarded with the perfect wild bird shot”.The Wilko wild bird competition runs until March .

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

Since then, using successive budgets, ministers have singled out HIE for deep cuts while increasing support for economic development where in Scotland. On the face of it, this is just centralisation by another name.“The consequences of this ill-judged decision should not be underestimated. With Brexit already posing a real threat to economic development across the region, including here in Orkney, it makes no sense for this SNP government to compound those dficulties by further slashing HIE’s funding.”Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “HIE have shown that locally-based support can make all the dference for rural enterprises. There can be no good reason to backtrack on that principle through cuts to their funding.“The solution to local challenges can’t always be found in the central belt.

He also asked for an update on the progress of current candidate mast locations in Burray, Hoy and Stromness.In response, Paul Wheelhouse, minister for connectivity and the islands, stated that no new proposed mast locations have been introduced since April  and — despite regular engagement with mobile operators — no operator has committed to using any of the candidate mast locations.Last July, Mr McArthur wrote to mobile phone operators urging them to engage constructively with the programme in Orkney.The MSP said: “It is disappointing to see that progress in closing gaps in mobile phone coverage across Orkney appears to have stalled.“While the Minister has provided assurances that discussions with mobile phone companies are ongoing, there is no sign they are prepared to engage seriously.  Sites have been identied in Stromness, Hoy and Burray, yet people and businesses in these communities are missing out on the better mobile coverage that should be available.“Meantime, efforts to identy new sites appear to have come to a complete halt. That is not good enough.“Ministers and mobile phone operators clearly agreed that public money was needed to plug existing gaps in the network. Since then, however, neither has been prepared to follow this up with action on the ground. As a result, we now have a G Infill Programme that is doing next to no infilling.“I will be urging Ministers to investigate why so little progress has been made and reiterating the need to get the programme back on track”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He has urged the Scottish Government to take the issue of fly-tipping more seriously, highlighting the environmental and social impacts of the incidents.Speaking later, Mr Halcro Johnston said: “Rural communities, like many across the Highlands and Islands, are particularly vulnerable to the utterly irresponsible and, of course, criminal activity of fly-tipping.“Incidents can cause real distress, as well as serious environmental concerns, for those communities blighted by fly-tipping. And the problem is often compounded when the waste which is dumped is not removed and then attracts even more incidents.“While fly-tipping is often carried out by a small number of offenders, too few of those responsible are being brought to justice. With both Police Scotland and local council budgets squeezed, that undoubtedly impacts on efforts to identy and prosecute offenders, as well as hampering efforts to clean up blighted areas.“The importance of a clean and attractive environment to the health and well-being of local residents is often overlooked. Many are rightly proud of their local communities and are left angry at those who fly-tip, as well as frustrated at efforts to combat it.“The Scottish Government needs to ensure there is a greater emphasis on tacking the scourge of fly-tipping, bringing to book those responsible for it, and making sure Police Scotland and local councils are properly resourced to do so”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In , Tavish Scott and I voted to support the budget.“Since then, however, the SNP has sought to backslide on this commitment and short change the communities in Orkney and Shetland. This year, that amounts to a shortfall of £m.“It is not good enough for SNP Ministers to claim they are open to negotiationthey so brazenly fail to honour the commitments they have made in previous negotiations. What trust can anyone have in the promises they make “Derek Mackay may have had to fall on his sword but the commitments he made to fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles was one made on behalf of the government as a whole. It is one that must now be delivered: no s and no buts.”Ms Wishart added: “The principle of fair ferry funding was not only accepted by this SNP government, it also reflected the will of the parliament.“Any responsible Government budgets for basic leline services needed across the country.

One by one, they planted the rough wooden memorials in the grass –  in all – each one marking a le lost to drugs. As they did so, they reflected on the good times, and lamented the waste.The last to plant his cross was Steven Currie. Steven’s older brother Peter McGrattan – known to most as Big Ped – was obsessed by music. “He was into punk when he was a boy, then U, Inspiral Carpets, Stone Roses, Oasis,” says Steven, who has the word “Brother” tattooed on his arm. “He was the man for the music, and you would follow suit because you looked up to him.” Steven would sit on the floor while Peter played DJ. “I’d tap tap my feet and think: ‘That’s quite good, that.’ His taste was superb. He could have been one of those guys that spotted bands.”But Big Ped carried a bit of weight and it affected his self-esteem. He trod that well-worn path from alcohol through soft drugs, heroin and crack cocaine, on to the grave. He died of a Valium overdose, after eight years clean, in August , dying in their mother’s house. “The paramedic came in and said: ‘He’s gone,’” Steven says. “I sat with him on the floor and cuddled him until they came and took him away.” Gone, but still loved still remembered.We are in the grip of a drugs deaths emergency here in Scotland, as everybody knows. Our drugs death rate is the worst in Europe. The toll for  was , – the highest it has ever been. It will come as little surprisethis year’s is higher still. The crosses are a reminder that each of the , was an inidual robbed of their future.En masse, they capture the scale of the problem. Spread out in rows like war graves, they say: “Here is a generation being wiped out, while those at the top play politics.” Is this too harsh  Maybe. Yet even as Steven placed his cross, the UK and Scottish governments were squabbling over rival drugs summits to be held in Glasgow a day apart. “My drugs summit is better than your drugs summit,” they blustered like children.Of course, politicians on both sides can justy their position. The UK government will say it announced its conference first. “But without consulting us, and without including those with lived experience,” the Scottish Government will counter. If either party does not understand how pathetic it sounds – how pathetic it is – for two governments who share responsibility for drugs policy to be unwilling to cut the crap and share a table, I suggest they get out of politics for a while and look at this from beyond the bubble. I suggest they spend some time in those communities where people are losing their lives for want of inter-agency collaboration and a coherent policy.This is not to suggest the Scottish Government is doing nothing. Last year – under pressure, and having previously cut frontline services – it set up the Drugs Deaths Task Force. In the recent budget it announced an extra £.m to be spent on “delivering innovative projects, testing new approaches and developing a national pathway for opiate substitute therapy”.The Scottish Government conference will also provide training in the use of Naloxone, which reverses the effect of drugs overdoses, and a demonstration model of a drugs consumption room. It insists what takes place there will “inform” its contribution to the UK summit the next day. And yet the mutual blame game neither side appears able to stop does not augur well.So often we hear about successful policy where, particularly in Portugal where drugs have been decriminalised, users have been de-stigmatised and those who consume can choose between harm reduction and rehab.But the key to Portugal’s success was not merely the approach itself, but the political consensus that formed around it and an unshakeable commitment to that approach through successive governments.Here in the UK, we are still treating drugs policy like a political football a forum for the airing of grievances a battleground for ideological dferences. This was happening long before the general election, but it is worse now the Tories have a thumping majority.The destructive relationship between Westminster and the Scottish Government – and more specically between Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson – is spilling into other areas too, most notably the COP climate conference which will take place in Glasgow in November.This conference is supposed to build the coalition necessary to break the deadlock on international climate action – and therefore requires UK-wide co-operation and a gt for diplomacy.Already, however, it has been reduced to oneupmanship. Despite being advised otherwise, Johnson has refused to give Sturgeon any formal role in proceedings. And there have been disputes over the venue itself. With the conference set to be held in the Scottish Events Campus on the north of the river, the Scottish Government booked out the Science Centre on the south. But now the UK government says it needs both sites and has accused the Scottish Government of trying to undermine its plans. To make matters worse, the Prime Minister is said to have referred to Sturgeon as “that wee Jimmy Krankie woman” to which Sturgeon responded “ Boris Johnson wants to make personal insults against me, I’m a big enough girl to make personal insults back”. All highly constructive.I think most of us accept Johnson would try the patience of a saint. As last week’s reshuffle demonstrated, he – or rather Dominic Cummings – is hell-bent on exercising control. Claire Perry claims he sacked her as the president of the COP and replaced her with former international development secretary Alok Sharma because Whitehall couldn’t cope with an independent conference. Sharma is said to have a questionable record on environment issues.Given all this, it must be tempting to answer criticism by pointing out that “Johnson started this” and that he is a twat of the highest order. But that gets us nowhere. Meanwhile, the planet burns.Aware, presumably, that tit-for-tat fighting is destructive and childish, Sturgeon has called for a reset in relations. But for that to happen, the UK government will not only have to be willing to co-operate on key issues, the Scottish Government will have to stop constantly passing the buck southwards.The constitutional debate is not going to disappear. Both governments will be arguing over the legitimacy of a second independence referendum for some time. But they need to be able to set that argument aside when it comes to shared crises such as drugs deaths and climate change.Only by attempting to find common ground can progress be made. If that requires pride to be swallowed, and teeth to be gritted, then so be it. There are too many crosses already in Springburn too many species already extinct.

We must surely, he added, be witnessing a historical record – a government in crisis after just two months in power.Meanwhile, Labour-supporting commentators lined up to explain the replacement of Javid with, as one columnist described him, the “alarmingly obedient” Rishi Sunak.I’m bound to say that for a man mired in crisis, Johnson appears remarkably relaxed. When he and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, told Javid they wanted his team cleared out and replaced by a new staff of advisers working across both  and  Downing Street, they must have know there was a chance – a good one, at that – that the chancellor wouldn’t wear it. His decision to walk cannot have come as a shock.McDonnell’s description of a government in crisis is, I’m afraid, inaccurate. Rather, what we’re seeing is a Prime Minister fully in control. There is no crisis.In Javid’s eager beaver replacement, Johnson has precisely what he wanted: a compliant chancellor who will do what he desires.Quite why Sunak’s loyalty should be seen as “alarming”, I’m not sure. There is nothing in the rule book of politics that says the sign of a good chancellor is a willingness to defy the prime minister. Was Tony Blair’s Labour government improved by the fact chancellor Gordon Brown spent his every waking moment seething with resentment over his rival’s supremacy  No, it wasn’t, was it  In fact, briefing and counter-briefing by Number  and Treasury sources meant the fractured relationship between prime minister and chancellor frequently got in the way of smooth government. When both men would rather have seen their policy agenda make headlines, their bitter relationship became the focus of media attention.When, finally, Brown realised his ambition of becoming prime minister, he could not change his ways. A man born to plot, Brown soon began undermining his chancellor, Alistair Darling, destroying a professional and personal relationship that had endured for years.David Cameron and George Osborne entered government in  having learned from their predecessors. Relations between Downing Street and the Treasury were good for the first time in a long time.Cameron and Osborne were a team and they always understood the pecking order. Each got what he needed from the relationship.But Johnson has no such partner. The Prime Minister has no political soulmate.This being so, what, exactly is the problem with Johnson wishing to take a firm grip of the Treasury  It is, I think, the sort of thing that might look to voters like strong leadership. Few, I’d wager, now lament the passing of the Javid era.Among Johnson’s immediate priorities is solidying the Conservative vote in areas of England which once ed Labour MPs. The Prime Minister will want to deliver for areas in the Midlands and the North of England which went Tory for the first time in generations. If he does not make good on his promises of regeneration and investment then the PM risks watching those voters drt back to Labour.What Johnson needs, right now, is a chancellor who is completely on board with this agenda. But there is something  beyond the Prime Minister’s desire for a compliant chancellor at play, here. Johnson has just sent a message to every member of his parliamentary party that the rules of the game have changed. His demand is complete loyalty, nothing less.From what McDonnell describes as a crisis will, I think, spring a period of uncommon stability in government. Last year, Johnson won the parliamentary majority he craved. Now, he has stamped his authority on his party in no uncertain terms.This same message came across loudly and clearly in Johnson’s dismissal from his cabinet of former leadership contenders Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey. Leadsom is a popular figure among members of the Tory Party’s Eurosceptic right wing. Johnson’s calculation is that he need not concern himself with the feelings of those members. Javid comes out of the last few days rather well, I think. No chancellor can complain about a demand for loyalty but the order to dismiss his team of advisers was a step too far, one provocation too many.That Javid said no to this suggests he has something about him, after all.In a statement following his resignation, the former chancellor reiterated his support for Johnson. I wonder how long this will last.It is undoubtedly the case that when political parties lose discipline, they lose elections. Look at the SNP. For decades, they did nothing but tear each other apart over the best way in which independence might be achieved. Bitter recrimination was part and parcel of SNP membership. And then Alex Salmond ed as party leader for a second stint and he laid down the bloody law to his colleagues. There was to be no briefing about colleagues, no criticism of government policy, and no public disagreement over any of the party’s positions.What followed was as period of unity in the SNP ranks that continues – the occasional domestic disturbance, aside – to this day.I’m not sure Johnson is behaving especially dferently to the way Salmond did. Doubtless, opposition parties will taunt Chancellor Rishi Sunak when he next rises to speak in the House of Commons. They will leave him in no doubt that they consider him a poodle.But each and every one of Boris Johnson’s opponents will privately admire the way he strengthened his grip on the Tory Party last week.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"it s nessie mystery skeleton washed up on scots beach leads to speculation it s loch ness monster","story":"The photos of the rotten carcass on Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen were posted on a local community Facebook page - Fubar News - after it was revealed following the powerful storm which battered the country last week.

The picturesque village sits on the Rhins of Galloway, the name given to the distinctive hammerhead peninsula on the southwest edge of the country.On paper, the distance from here to Larne seems trling. Just over  miles separate Portpatrick from Northern Ireland. Bridges have successfully spanned greater distances in many other parts of the world.But those crossings didn’t have to deal with the terrying depths and changeable weather that seafarers in this remote corner of Scotland know only too well.“I’ve worked offshore for  years, and I would rather face the North Sea on a bad night than the North Channel,” says Calum Currie, who helped lead the local buy-out of Portpatrick’s harbour in .It’s a Thursday afternoon and, by Wigtownshire’s bracing standards, a fairly calm February day. The sun is dazzlingly bright and the wind, while noticeable, isn’t strong enough to blow you off the pier.“See that red sandstone block ” Currie points at a colossal stone which sits incongruously on the breakwater. “That weighs around six tonnes. The waves can pick those up and hurl them over the harbour wall. In winter, the swell in the harbour can reach eight feet.”: Red tape threatens to strangle Boris Johnson’s ‘vanity project’The North Channel offers regular reminders of its awesome power. During exceptionally bad weather in December , passengers aboard a PO ferry bound for Cairnryan feared they were going under when the boat suddenly lurched downwards – toppling articulated lorries like dominos in the process. It is across such waters that Boris Johnson hopes a bridge can finally be built. Civil servants have been asked to come up with a workable plan for a seemingly impossible challenge.Residents in the Rhins of Galloway are being asked by the UK government to think big. Instead, they’re more likely to shrug. The Prime Minister’s grand plan is merely the latest contribution to a debate that has spanned four centuries.“It seems a wee bit fancul,” is the assessment of June Hoad, chair of Portpatrick community council, who has lived in the area all her le.“It would be nicewe were to be consulted in all of this. So far we have heard nothing.”The question of how best to cross from Scotland to Ireland is one that has never been definitively answered.Some of the greatest engineering minds of the modern era were determined that Portpatrick was the solution.John Smeaton, the man hailed as the father of civil engineering, set about in the late th century to make the village a suitable port for regular mail packet sailings to and from the Emerald Isle. He proposed two breakwaters to enclose and protect the village bay. But efforts to construct a northern breakwater failed as a result of the destructive powers of the sea and were abandoned in .John Rennie expanded on Smeaton’s ideas in . A new south breakwater and lighthouse were dutully completed by  – only for a storm to undermine the pier head just three years later. Work on the unfinished northern breakwater was soon abandoned.By  both the mail boats and ferry services had switched from Portpatrick to Stranraer, which sits in the sheltered waters of Loch Ryan.Fast forward to  and Stena Line quit Stranraer to open a new deep water port in Cairnryan, six miles up the coast – a decision the company insisted was necessary to cut costs and reduce crossing times.But few people seem satisfied with the current arrangements, which see both PO and Stena Line operate from two separate terminals.For  years passengers could alight from the train at Stranraer and kill time in its many pubs or hotels before boarding the ferry. Irish banknotes were accepted by many local businesses. Now the town’s east pier and its vast lorry park, formerly home to Stena Line, stand empty – a visual reminder of Stranraer’s diminished status.The current ferry terminals in Cairnryan are grim, utilitarian efforts with few amenities for passengers.There is no rail link to either dock. The thousands of HGVs that use the ferries must navigate the A, which runs south from Ayr, or the A, which runs east from Dumfries.These roads do not resemble vital economic links between two nations.It is dficult to describe the depth of unhappiness the A and A cause the residents of Wigtownshire. Only the A to Inverness – which is now being dualled at fantastic cost – can rival their claim to be the most despised trunk roads in the country.The condition of the roads don’t just affect iniduals – it hurts the economy as well.Stena Line, PO and the Belfast harbour authorities last year collectively called on Transport Scotland to upgrade the A and A to dual carriageway as a matter of priority. The trio said such an investment was required to prevent loss of business to better connected ports in England and Wales.Transport bosses responded that they had already invested heavily in both routes and ruled out making them dual carriageway along their entire .“I’d like to see Boris Johnson drive here without being chauffeured,” says Carly MacDougall, a member of Portpatrick community council, when the subject of his bridge proposal is raised.Residents in the village have lost loved ones who could not be transferred in time from Stranraer’s small hospital to better equipped facilities in Glasgow.Locals joke that more babies are born on the road to Dumfries than in the town’s maternity unit itself. Speak to anyone in Portpatrick or Stranraer about the possibility of a bridge to Ireland and the conversation soon s to one crucial question: how can they even think about such a project when the existing roads are so bad The region’s poor connectivity is an issue the Stranraer  Wigtownshire Free Press has asked again and again over the years.It is one of the few weekly newspapers in Scotland not to have fallen into the hands of the big media conglomerates, and unlike many other local titles, retains a visible presence in the centre of the town it serves.Jenner Jones recently moved from Glasgow to Portpatrick after taking up a job as a reporter on the paper. While greatly enjoying her new le, she admits the condition of roads in the area leave a lot to be desired.“There is a delicate balance,” she said. “It’s a great tourist attraction. People love it down here because it feels empty.“But you look our through archives and the same arguments were being made  years ago.“MSPs all say the same things regardless of political party. They promote the region – but it feels too easy to ignore it.”John Cooper, a veteran newspaperman, agrees. He was brought up in Stranraer and ed to take charge of his hometown newspaper last year.“It is a dferent world down here,” he says. “People talk about it being ‘the forgotten corner’ of Scotland. It’s almost like an island.“Stranraer has been promised so much over the years that talk of a bridge just washes over people.“Every party has struggled with the transport issues down here over the decades – and in the end nothing gets done.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon public support for scottish independence at tipping point","story":"The SNP leader has predicted an \"acceleration\" in the sht towards independence seen in recent polls as she stepped up her demands for a second vote on leaving the UK in response to Brexit.The Scottish Parliament recently backed a motion, pushed through by the SNP-Greens majority, which endorsed a second referendum.

While this year’s results have been magnicent, we are also aware that over the last number of years SLG has been a top performing school in NI and that these results from our students merely consolidate our achievements of the past as well.Consistently outstanding academic outcomes such as these, over a number of years are the combination of engaged students, deep curriculum planning, high quality learning and teaching experiences for students, rigorous tracking of student progress, supportive parents and of course a superb teaching staff.As a school we are constantly monitoring and evaluating all aspects of curriculum delivery including engaging with our students regularly to ensure our students are not only achieving highly, but are both happy and enjoying their learning too.Good Governance, recent school investments in new pedagogies for the CPD of our staff, as well as recent DE capital investments have also contributed to the year on year academic success which has left our school well established as a top ranking school in NI and in the UK.All associated with the school are proud of our achievements to date and our teachers are privileged to be able to support our students, as they continue to achieve highly and are in strong positions to contribute to society in the future, through access to an exciting range of career pathways”.

However, a letter’s been sent to the family home asking her to “contact a monumental sculptor” to “make this memorial safe”.A family member – who prefers not to be identied – told us about her upset when she opened the letter.“It was a bit of shock, to be honest,” she said. “Everyone can make mistakes, but this is one that could so easily have been avoided with a bit of sensitivity and professionalism. City Hall keeps records of deaths, so obviously nobody bothered to do any cross-checking. And it would be a very simple matter for the workers inspecting the headstones to take a note of who’s in the plot as an extra precaution. Manynot most of the graves in the cemetery are family plots and somebody should have taken that into consideration before this process started. It’s just a lack of thought and care, in my opinion, and it was totally avoidable.“I would ask them now just to do what they can to make sure their process is tightened up to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen to any more families. I’m sure it’s happened before and it will certainly happen again unless the system is improved.”Like many local authorities across the north and in Britain, Belfast City Council is in the midst of a memorial inspection programme launched in  after an eight-year-old boy was killed by a falling headstone in Scotland the previous year.In the letter to the local family, the City Hall Director of City Service said while the Council does “not wish to cause any further upset” to bereaved families, it must “make sure” its cemeteries are “safe places” for workers and visitors.In a statement to the Andersonstown News, A Belfast City Council spokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for the upset and hurt caused to the family. As part of our memorial safety inspection started in , we have written to around , deed holders. Some of the information we hold may not have been updated by relatives or family members, hence this administrative error has occurred. We recognise this will have been very upsetting for those receiving the letter and apologise for the error.”But the family member rejected any suggestion that families should be required to update information about their loved ones for the Council. All deaths in the city are legally required to be registered with Belfast City Council, which also holds burial records for the City Cemetery.“The death was registered with City Hall,” she said. “They have the information at their fingertips and that is enough. The simple fact of the matter is that they made no effort to access that information and are just sending out letters willy-nilly to deed-holders, most of whom are going to be older people. It’s very unfair of the Council to try and turn this around like that. This is too sensitive a matter to be treated in such a slipshod manner.”Askedupdating the Council’s records after the statutory death registration process was the responsibility of the deceased’s family, a Council spokeswoman said: “While we make every effort to ensure the information we have is accurate and up to date, which can be challenging given the passage of time, on this occasion details were missed. We will review the process of writing to deed holders to ensure further checks are in place to try to prevent any similar errors or upset for another family.We sincerely apologise for the error.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

a walkout in a row over a % pay increase  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBakers at Allied Bakeries in east Belfast during a walkout in a row over a % pay increase By Michael McHugh, PAFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailWorkers have vowed to halt Pancake Tuesday in Northern Ireland during strike action at one of the UK’s largest bakeries.Bakers at Allied Bakeries in east Belfast walked out early on Sunday morning for the first time in decades in a row over a % pay claim.The factory makes products such as Kingsmill bread.This is one of the busiest weeks of the year at the site, which is part of Associated British Foods.The multinational company owns a series of brands, including clothes retailer Primark, and posted profits of around £. billion last year.A Kingsmill lorry stopped at the gates where dozens of workers carrying red Unite the Union flags demonstrated in the morning chill.Local police mediated.Unite regional co-ordinating officer Susan Fitzgerald said: “There will be no Pancake Tuesday celebrated in Northern Ireland and we hope to affect it where as well.“During this picket, we will be sending people to stand outside supermarkets leafleting, saying that other working people, in solidarity with Allied Bakery workers, should boycott Sunblest, Kingsmill and the other products that come out of here.“That includes a favourite unfortunately, pancakes, which are going to be in demand next week.” vw,vw,px, px\"Unite the Union official Susan Fitzgerald at Allied Bakeries in east Belfast She said the company’s turnover was worth £ billion but workers were being denied a % pay increase.This is the key week of production ahead of Pancake Tuesday, Ms Fitzgerald said.She added: “We intend to disrupt that as much as we possibly can because we have no option.“When working people are forced to go to thisfor a fair pay increase, when this company pays out millions in bonuses to directors, we feel we arethe support of ordinary people right across Northern Ireland and further afield.”An Allied Bakeries statement said it was proud of its reputation as a long-term and responsible local employer and deeply disappointed that union officials have rejected its latest pay offer in favour of industrial action.“All employees involved are paid at rates above that recommended by the Living Wage Foundation and benefit from company-subsidised pensions, free le insurance cover as well as a range of other benefits,” it said.“We have increased our rates of pay every year for the past  years and will do so again this year.“In the meantime, contingency plans are in place and we do not expect supply of our core Sunblest, Kingsmill and own-label pancakes to be signicantly impacted as we engage with our employees to resolve this dispute.”Ms Fitzgerald said Allied Bakeries was offering a .% pay increase, which she added was signicantly less than the Hovis bakery, which has a plant a short distance away in Belfast.“There are workers here, women and men, who have put  years of their lives into this company and on a day like today when there has been hail, sleet and snow, these workers are forced to stand on a picket line and unfortunately a couple of drivers trying to unsuccessfully get a truck through.“There is no work in there today, there is no-one going in and there certainly is no work coming out.”She said demonstrators were resolved not to leave the picket line until their fair pay requests were met.Ms Fitzgerald said: “These are workers who work around the clock, who work weekends for a consolidated sht rate.“When you strip that bare, it is little more than the minimum wage.“These are people who are feeding the country.“No society can do without bread, these are key workers.”PA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most

It’s time they packed up and disbanded.”Ms O’Neill and Mr Kelly’s attendance at a PSNI recruitment event was hailed by Chief Constable Simon Byrne as “seismic and historic”.It was the first time such a senior Sinn Fein figure had attended such a meeting, although the party has expressed support for police in Northern Ireland on many occasions in the past.Last year there were attempted bomb attacks by dissident republicans targeting police in Belfast, Craigavon in Co Armagh and near the Irish border in Fermanagh.The New IRA and Continuity IRA are involved.Police have branded as “cruel and disgusting” anti-PSNI recruitment posters depicting an officer who was severely injured in a bomb attack.The posters used a picture of Peadar Heffron along with a warning that anyone thinking of joining the police could suffer similar injuries.Mr Heffron lost a leg when a dissident bomb detonated under his car near Randalstown in  as he travelled to work. He now uses a wheelchair.Meanwhile, Ms McDonald commended her negotiating, Executive and Assembly teams – led by Ms O’Neill – for “working hard for citizens”.She listed recent successes following the restoration of devolved political powersharing at Stormont.The party leader said: “Already in the Executive we have seen measures taken to tackle poverty, including moving quickly to end the nurses dispute of equal pay extending welfare mitigations, a new house building programme has been announced.“Additional funding has been made available for education and the victims and survivors of the contaminated blood scandal in the north will receive compensation payments.”PA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadTributes to Arnie Clarke who drowned in desperate bid to save dog in Co Down riverNorthern Ireland councils in debt to tune of £m as some ratepayers face raft of cuts to servicesNorthern Ireland school principal working with police after #vicious# lies about staff and pupils posted onlineBelfast fraudster Mackie back behind bars after thefts from church and charityChildren present when man shot in #savage# attack in Belfast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic and travel alerts latest updates","story":"Latest traffic and travelThe road has been closed. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bced-cd-dac-e-b_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bced-cd-dac-e-b_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bced-cd-dac-e-b_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bced-cd-dac-e-b_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Snow and ice could cause problems on Wednesday  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappLatest traffic and travelFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFollow the latest updates from our travel feed belowOur live updates from across Northern Ireland are compiled by @TrafficwatchNI, @BBCNITravel and @PSNITraffic.Today#s weather forecast for your areaNI Railways,  , Ulsterbus, Dublin train, journey plannerBelfast City Airport arrivals and departuresBelfast International Airport arrivals and departuresA Twitter List by BelTel  Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadTributes to Arnie Clarke who drowned in desperate bid to save dog in Co Down river#Miracle no one was hurt# as Storm Dennis damages Dundonald shopsNorthern Ireland councils in debt to tune of £m as some ratepayers face raft of cuts to servicesNorthern Ireland school principal working with police after #vicious# lies about staff and pupils posted onlineChildren present when man shot in #savage# attack in Belfast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, Mr Carlaw defended the proposal and said: “By proposing the feasibility study with the government in Ireland of a potential bride between Ireland and Scotland, it’s implicit that he wants the new investment.”“I’m not opposed to it, you’ve got to be bold and imaginative,” he said of the bridge.“There are bigger bridges than that where in the world, lots of people scoffed about them but I think we have to be imaginative going forward.“I don’t know whether the particular topography of the sea bed between Scotland and Ireland is going to make it possible, but I’m as encouraged by the response of the Northern Ireland government as I am discouraged by the cynicism of the Scottish Government.“These are things we should be prepared to look at.”After it emerged Number  had charged officials from a number of government departments to work on the proposal, Mr Johnson’s official spokesman said: “The PM set out this was an idea which he believed could have some merit so, as a result of that, you would expect the Government to be looking into it.”Thank you to the party for electing me leader.Now is the time to lead.Weâve only  months to beat the SNP and present Scotland

worst-hit areas and people moved to emergency rescue centres after their properties and businesses were devastated by water from overflowing rivers.On Sunday afternoon South Wales Police said they had declared a major incident as firefighters and rescue crews continued to help communities who have been cut off due to the flood water.Assistant Chief Constable Jenner Gilmer, said: “I would like to

waterways, and monitor local and social media for updates.Advice for people in affected areas 👇â ï¸ Remain indoors, unless your journey is absolutely necessary.â ï¸ Steer well clear of dangers

told the PA news agency she felt her force had done enough to warn the public of the risk of flooding, stating that the subsequent rainfall was “worse than people had anticipated”.She said: “When things began to escalate overnight we were very well placed to escalate our response and get to as many people as possible.”South Wales Fire and Rescue Service area manager Ian Greenman said the the service had received an “unprecedented” , calls during Sunday and had carried out  le rescues.One of the worst-hit areas in South Wales was the village of Nantgarw, Rhondda Cynon Taff, near Cardf, which had seen entire streets left underwater since the early hours of Sunday morning.Emergency teams including firefighters and volunteers had been evacuating the village’s Oxford Street since around

haven’t seen this, it’s incredible, and it’s right throughout the South Wales Valleys.“In my  years in the service this is the worst I’ve ever seen.“I’ve never experienced anything like this

It was really quick.“Outside the cars were under water.”Chris Davies, director of the Arc Training company in the nearby Treforest industrial estate, said the bottom floor of his business was “totally under water”, and said he was concerned whether the incident would be covered by insurance.He said: “My thought now is whether this is covered by insurance, because it’s a natural occurrence.“It could mean a loss of business for us. It will take weeks to get back now. By the time you get your insurance claim in, get money back in, buy all new stuff, start trading again, you’re talking thousands.”Elsewhere, the town of Pontypridd was also hit by flooding after the River Taff burst its banks, forcing shops and businesses to remain closed on its main shopping street while cars were left stranded in roads.In Swansea, a man was declared dead after being pulled from the River Tawe near Trebanos Rugby Club.Dyfed-Powys Police said that a man in his s was seen entering the river near Gorsedd Park in Ystradgynlais area at about am on Sunday morning.The force said he was rescued further along the river, but despite paramedics battling to save his le he was pronounced dead at the scene.Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious or being linked to the bad weather.Rhondda MP Chris Bryant set up a crowdfunding page to raise a target of £, for residents affected by flooding in his constituency.I have set up a crowdfunder to support those affected by the floods in the #Rhondda.If you can, please donate and RT:https:t.co hFfObhP— Chris BryantFebruary , The Labour MP wrote: “Seeing the floods devastate our communities is truly heartbreaking.“Homes and businesses across the Rhondda have been affected by the winds and rain of Storm Dennis and many families will have lost everything.“We’ve been inundated with offers of support and help.

Many of the pupils at Ballougry PS have a family link to the school and children come from as far afield as Eglinton and Donemana to be educated there.We have children whose parents, grandparents and even great grandparents have been at the school.The parents have such fond memories of their time here that they want their children to enjoy the same type of education, no matter where they are living.Mr OKane believes that attending a small primary school equips children well for the transition to secondary school.In a small school setting you have to get on well with everyone and the children thrive on it.In bigger schools you can jump around friendship groupsthings arent working out, but here you just have to work it out.We were very happy with out recent transfer test results and our children will be moving on to every post primary school in the city.”Mr OKane concluded: The feedback that we always get is that the children really do represent us well.Among the schools best known past pupils is renowned actress, Amanda Burton, well known for her television roles, including Heather Black in the Channel  soap opera Brookside, Beth Glover in Peak Practice, Sam Ryan in the BBC crime drama series Silent Witness, Clare Blake in The Commander and Karen Fisher in Waterloo Road.Her father was a headmaster at the school. googletag.cmd.push Photos: Tom Heaney   googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Whilst drivers will be able to pay for their parking with cash, the app allows those who wish to pay via the app, the opportunity to do so.The new system will also feature the innovative start stop ality which enables drivers to start their parking booking when they arrive at the car park and stop the payment when theyto their car, meaning drivers only pay for the amount of parking time specically used whilst also mitigating against ‘overstaying’ penalties.JustPark currently works with over  local authorities across the UK and is partnered with many established operators. Using its award-winning , existing customers are able to search, find and start a session in as little as  seconds using the JustPark app – it’s the highest rated car parking payment app in the UK, with an average satisfaction rating of %, has . million users and a * Trustpilot rating.There will be a crossover period when the old system is still working. The change in service means that users will need to become familiar with a new parking app, however the change has been implemented with drivers in mind.Visitors and residents in Northern Ireland will be able to use the JustPark  with confidence that all of the cashless benefits they currently enjoy will not only be continued, but also improved upon.To download the JustPark app directly, visit https:t.co SeRcfiHYp googletag.cmd.push  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an ‘Embrace the Giant Spirit’ event organised by Tourism NI, actors Stephen Rea, Tara Lynne O’Neill and Laurence Kinlan, musician Neil Martin and the singer-songwriter Lisa Hannigan, gave a unique and moving performance to celebrate Seamus Heaney’s work at Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin.The programme was curated by Seamus Heaney HomePlace, the literary centre in Bellaghy, Co Derry, which takes visitors on a journey through the le and literature of the poet, with an invited audience including members of the Heaney family, representatives from the local tourism industry as well as arts, culture and media.The performers came together as part of an initiative which aims to highlight the literary connections between Seamus Heaney HomePlace, which recently reached its , visitor milestone, and the hugely successful ‘Listen Now Again’ exhibition, which draws on the National Library’s extensive Heaney archive and has welcomed over , visitors since it opened in Dublin in July .Featuring powerful performances of Seamus Heaney’s work, including an adaptation in words and music of an excerpt of Aeneid: Book VI and a haunting performance of Anahorish by Lisa Hannigan, the event comes as HomePlace prepares to extend its visitor experience into the landscape which so inspired the poet and which features in his work.A total of  locations of signicance to Seamus Heaney are being developed, notable among them being Lough Beg a place of ‘special memories’ for the poet where a boardwalk will lead visitors to a newly constructed viewing point to see Church Island and its famous spire, with extracts of poetry audible, as well as visible along the route. A riverside walk by the Moyola River is also being created and a newly commissioned sculpture will form the focal point for visitors to hear and read poetry at the eel fishery in Toome. Visitors will also be able to download an app, which will allow access to augmented reality as they journey through each location.Fiona Cunningham, RoI Market Manager for Tourism NI said, “With the impressive Seamus Heaney HomePlace, situated in Bellaghy, only two and a half hours from Dublin, visitors can really immerse themselves in our greatest poet’s writing and discover many areas of his beloved hometown that inspired so much of his work.“Over , thousand have visited the Dublin exhibition since it opened in , and many may be unaware of the very unique and spiritually moving experience one can also get when visiting Heaney HomePlace. Visitors are coming from all over the world to soak up the beautul place, people and landscapes in Northern Ireland that inspired him so much and we want to encourage people from across Ireland to make the unforgettable trip to follow his journey, walk the paths he took and explore through his words at Seamus Heaney HomePlace. We are really inviting you to embrace our giant spirit in NI and to awaken your own.”HomePlace also recently opened its new Tourism NI approved Visitor Information Centre, offering a range of new services for visitors to learn about further immersive activities, places to visit and stay in the area. Chris Heaney, son of Seamus Heaney, said: “It’s a pleasure to be here this evening to celebrate Seamus Heaney HomePlace and to highlight its outstanding events programme of readings, concerts and performances”.Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Councillor Martin Kearney, commented, “We in Bellaghy and Dublin share our custodianship of a signicant legacy and this evening HomePlace has been very pleased to be curating here, sharing also a taste of the experience our visitors have in our performance space.“We hope that we will continue, inidually and collectively, to celebrate all our writers and the great literary talent which has emerged from this island. There is a momentum building across Ireland and an opportunity for us to create a cultural tourism network across the entire landscape, North to South, East to West, where we and our visitors can embrace a ‘giant literary spirit’”.Brian McCormick, manager of HomePlace said: “We want to extend our sincere thanks to Tourism NI for hosting such a special evening and for continuing to highlight the incredible opportunities there are, through HomePlace and Listen Now Again, for visitors to engage with and be inspired by Seamus Heaney and his work”. The latest Seamus Heaney-related investment is valued at over pound,, with % funding from DAERA and the remainder from Mid Ulster District Council which owns and operates Seamus Heaney HomePlace.To book your short break to Northern Ireland visit: www.discovernorthernireland googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That feeling of love and happiness between the three of us was just perfect. This led to a conversation between my son and I, and later his girlfriend and his dad, about what holding hands means, about the memories it provokes and how we hold hands.How we hold hands  I hear you ask, don’t we all hold hands the same  Well I thought we did but no we don’t. . There’s the palm together hand hold, the fingers entwined hand hold, the just fingertips entwined hand hold and there are more. Which one you are, my son told me, depends on who you are holding hands with! Well I disagreed I always hold hands in a palms together way - but apparently that’s just a mummy hold according to my son!. Yes, his dad disagreed, but my son’s girlfriend didn’t.So, what does holding hands mean, what does it make us think, what does it make us feel and remember  George was smiling as he remembered his grandad holding his wrist - yes, his wrist not his hand - to cross the road. George said he really didn’t like this as he was about eight years old at the time but he does remember letting his grandad do it because he thought it made his grandad happy. His dad laughed when George said this and told George his grandad did the same to him – hmmm, I wonder, will this become a family tradition  I remember holding hands with my mum lots of times, but most of all I remember her sliding her little finger up my wrist as she held my hand and that this would make us both laugh together. My son’s girlfriend said, although she remembered holding hands with her mum, she also remembered always holding hands with her best friend everywhere they went. Personally, I can remember telling my son that he had to hold my hand when we were out so I didn’t get lost - great excuse to keep him safe. I had this same “holding hands” conversation later that week with my friend who told me she loved holding hands with her little one as they sing row your boat and with her older child who loves to walk on the walls in front of people’s houses. I think a favourite of mine, apart from that with my son nieces and mum, of course , is when I am in school or nursery and I see all the children holding hands with mum or dadchattering away and smiling together. I’m smiling as I’m writing remembering all these things - I know you’ll have your own happy hand holding memories too. It’s a simple gesture but does show how much we care, how much we love, does send a message of caring through touch, does support a loving bond, can help us feel, and give, security and a feeling of belonging to each other. googletag.cmd.push But, as our babies, toddlers and children grow into pre-teens the hand holding begins to disappear - unless you are lucky enough to have an affectionate teenage daughter.So, enjoy it today, remember the feeling of those little hands in yours, take time to hold hands together whether walking along, sitting and watching tv or singing a simple rhyme. For these memories will take you through the stroppy teenage years - teenage years wherein their idea of holding hands with you in public is just the most embarrassing thing ever, and all the way to Grandparent days!!!Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Local council officials say that they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site.They hope that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what residents and traders would like to see and what would work at this particular site.The development brief for the town centre location is expected to outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon has welcomed confirmation that a so-called soft market testing exercise is to proceed shortly.ldquoThis will allow potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to visit the Irish Street site during a planned open day. This will allow them to give their views on the potential of the site and point out any likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe feedback provided will be used to assist the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to prepare a development brief for the site.ldquoThe regeneration project for the former police base site provides an opportunity to regenerate Downpatrick town centre.

Conor McKenna was influential in the centre of the park and he was dangerous every time he was on the ball trying to pick out the killer pass to unlock the Drumaness defence.Persistence finally paid off when Corey McCoubrey let fly with a superb strike that the Mills lsquokeeper could only parry and Brendan McShane was there knock the rebound home.Drumaness were a real threat from set-pieces and almost had an equaliser when a corner nearly caught out lsquokeeper Gerard OrsquoGormley, but the ball ped at his feet and the Mills strikers werenrsquot quick enough to capitalise on the mistake.The second half was much more testing for both teams as the weather conditions worsened and chances were few and far between with players barely able to hear each other on the pitch.To their credit, the Academy team kept plugging away, trying to stick to their game plan and they were rewarded when Karl Kearney came off the bench and was played in by Dagens.The young striker kept a cool head and calmly slotted the ball home giving the lsquokeeper no chance.The Bhoys were able to see the game out with a clean sheet and comfortably seal the league title with three games to spare..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 Luke.jpg","title":"Luke boxing clever on way to major win  ","story":"A YOUNG Saintfield schoolboy is proving to be a knockout in the boxing ring.Eleven year-old Luke McAuley, who fights out of Ormeau Road Boxing Club where his father, Gareth, is his coach, won the kg title at the Armagh and Down Championships in Silverbridge, Co Armagh, on Sunday.The St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College student learned the basics of his trade at East Down Boxing Club before joining his fatherrsquos club and he believes he owes the coaches there a great deal.The latest in a long line of boxers from the McAuley family, Luke blasted his way to the title when he knocked out his opponent from John Bosco, Newry, in the first round of the final.This was his first ever competition, but he showed he was a real contender when he accounted for his Clonard opponent - in the semi-final.Luke is now back in the gym and preparing for the Antrim Open Championships in a few weeksrsquo time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 Minister.jpg","title":"Minister says it’s ‘too early’ for report on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"JUST weeks into her new job, Stormont roads minister Nichola Mallon says it is ldquotoo early to provide a progress report on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed multi-million pound bypass.South Down MLA Jim Wells had asked the minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure to provide an update on the scheme.His request mdash via a written Assembly question mdash came after local politicians agreed to seek an early meeting with Ms Mallon to make the case for work to start on the proposed poundm scheme.In her response to Mr Wells, the minister said that she recognises that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch.But added: ldquoUnfortunately, I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints. But I am committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland.ldquoI will be assessing the pressures across my department reflecting on my priorities, the commitments in the lsquoNew Decade: New Approachrsquo document and the budget made available for the period ahead.Ms Mallon said that as a result, it is therefore ldquotoo early to comment on specic schemes such as the Ballynahinch bypass.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.During last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, there was across-the-board political support for a motion seeking a meeting with Ms Mallon and seniors roads engineers to discuss the Ballynahinch scheme.It was tabled by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is keen to see work starting on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads.He said the scheme has been shovel ready for some time and is hoping the Department for Infrastructure will allocate funding to allow construction work, which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete, to begin.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.He added: ldquoThe time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding. I have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason described Ballynahinch as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.

However, a buoyant St Maryrsquos outfit replied with points from Cora Convery, Alishia Lundy and Shannon Sloan to maintain their six-point lead.Six points quickly became  by the half-time break as St Maryrsquos continued to terrorise St Fanchearsquos and scores from Doran , Abi Murphyand the lethal Shannon Sloangave the locals a commanding - to - lead.St Franchearsquos came out fighting in the second half, scoring a goal and two points without reply to reduce the arrears to  point, but that was as good as it got as St Maryrsquos quickly regained the initiative and went for broke.They certainly put the foot on the gas and points from Erin Sands, Katie Convie and Cara Doran had St Maryrsquos well clear St Fanchearsquos kept on to the bitter end and forced a great save form St Marys goalkeeper Fia McFaul as they tried to get back into contention.However, McFaul and her defensive wall of Keely OrsquoNeill, player of the match Nora Maguire, team captain Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy and Lucy Morgan kept St Fanchearsquos at bay.At midfield, Eimear Teggart and Erin Sands dominated throughout the game and kept their dazzling forward busy with a constant supply of good ball.Abi Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convery, Shannon Sloan and Katie Convie were literally unplayable and gave the St Fanchearsquos defence a torrid time all afternoon.St Maryrsquos: Fia McFaul, Keely OrsquoNeill, Nora Maguire, Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy, Lucy Morgan, Eimear Teggart, Erin Sands, Abie Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convie, Shannon Sloan, Katie Convie.

Local authority officials hope that work on the much-needed project can start within four years.News of the new leisure centre plan, exclusively revealed in the Recorder last October, is being discussed by senior council officials and local politicians and recently topped the agenda during a special workshop examining the way forward.Among the proposals being examined are building a new complex at the rear of the current Newcastle Centre, which enjoys protected status. This would also result in the current outdoor Tropicana swimming pool being bulldozed.Local politicians were recently presented with an update on progress on a new leisure proposal, with council officials confirming this week that a review of ious feasibility studies and their findings is being considered by the organisation.While the local authority said that it is not yet in a position to confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or indeed the Tropicana, it insists any new-build will not encroach on the promenade at the rear.Most signicantly, the council has confirmed that any commissioning of a full economic appraisal and business case would involve consultations, including public meetings, as part of the process.Council officials say that they are ldquoacutely aware of the need for improved leisure provision in Newcastle and are keen to address criticism that on wet days in the resort, there is little provision for both residents and tourists.While redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre, which forms part of the Annesley Buildings, is one option moving forward, there are suggestions that given the age of the building, the scale of the work involved an the constraints of the site, a new-build at the rear would be more most cost-effective.One of the key issues the council will have to address is how it intends to replace the Tropicana , as widely expected, it will be bulldozed. There are those pushing for an indoor water facility which would be available all year round.Council officials are also keen to ensure that the redevelopment of the Main Street site is in keeping with a part of the resort where millions of pounds have been invested over recent years. Serious consideration will also have to be given to on-site car parking, included adequate disabled provision.In addition, council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl to develop a new store and dedicated base for the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team.Councillors are keen for the local authority to take the lead and ensure that Newcastle boasts an ultra-modern community and leisure facility.They say that the provision of a new centre for residents and visitors is long overdue and that a resort the size of Newcastle should and must have adequate leisure provision. Some councillors are keen to see a family fun pool in the proposed new-build.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed that several feasibility studies and strategic reports have been compiled in relation to the Newcastle Centre.She also confirmed that a recent review of the feasibility studies and their findings has been completed and is being considered by the local authority.ldquoUntil further scoping works are carried out, the council cannot confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or the Tropicana, said the spokeswoman.She added: ldquoHowever, encroaching on to the promenade is not anticipated.

It’s a conversational well that is unlikely to run dry given the numerous prompts that adorn the walls, the rails and the display counters.Northern Ireland might not be as big a force in world football as the likes of Germany, France and Brazil, but per capita the Province punches well above its weight in terms of a fanaticism for football, be it the Irish League, the national team or an adopted team in England or Scotland.Mugs featuring the Irish Leagues finest: Glenn Ferguson, Gregg Davidson, Chris Walker, Billy Caskey, Jamie Mulgrew, Joe Gormley and George McMullan \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The shop which was opened in August by Ryan Gilmore, , and his business partner Pete McDonald, , taps into the rich demand for memorabilia amongst the nation’s football mad population.It leans towards the local game, celebrating the old kits and legendary stars of the Irish league, and immortalising national heroes such as Best, Whiteside, Jennings and more latterly Evans, McAuley and Healy. Ryan explained how a friendship forged in football gave birth to what is believed to be the only dedicated retro football shop in Northern Ireland.He said: “Pete and I are both Bangor fans – that’s a real labour of love – but we didn’t know each other until we met through work. We worked together for years in Yell where we pretty much talked about football non-stop.A Linfield shirt from  “The idea to start selling shirts online came after I’d been over to watch the Frampton fightand I went to the Classic Football Shirts Shop in Manchester. It’s  times bigger than the shop we have here.“I was with my fiancee at the time, now my we, and I said to her I’m going to try and do something like this online. I know how to do marketing, I love football, social media is easy enough when you know what you’re doing so I thought, I’ll give it a go. She didn’t object so that was a good start.“I started doing the shirts online last December. I got a bit of traction so I applied for a stall at St George’s in December and again in August.“I was getting married in July so I probably should have only been concentrating on that and nothing , but then I found out this unit in Smithfield was available. The Northern Ireland Subbeteo print is the top seller“Just before I was getting married – I think it was only a couple of days – I signed for the unit. Just before we got married I had to break the news to my we that I now owned a shop.“Around that time I spoke to Pete about coming on board. He said, ‘you don’t know what you’re doing, I don’t know what I’m doing, let’s see what we can do together’.”Askedthe dynamic changes when something you love becomes your job, Pete said: “I could never see us getting bored of it, I think I’ll forever be in that bubble, it’s something I love. “People work in office jobs and talk about football all day, that’s what we were like. Now we’ve got a set up where we can talk about football to whoever comes in and it’s part of the job.”Some of retro kit coasters for saleRyan commented: “On the business side of things we’re talking to clubs, striking up partnerships with other companies. Everything revolves around a love of football.”Pete said: “It’s good getting into the business side of it. There’s a buzz that comes from speaking to commercial managers of football clubs, trying to strike up partnerships.“It’s really easy to speak to people over here, quite a few clubs have heard of us.”He continued: “We’ve four clubs from the Irish League we’re in partnership with – Portadown, Linfield, Glentoran and Cltonville – and we’re branching across into England too.”At the moment the NI Classic Shirt Co is a part time venture, with the shop open on Thursday afternoonsand Fridays and Saturdays from . to .pm.Pete said: “We’re hoping to get full time. We’re going after clubs in England, Scotland and the League of Ireland as well as more local clubs. If they put in orders of a lot of units that can allow us to get a regular income and go full time.The interior of the shop in Smithfield market“We want to do as much Irish League stuff as we can with every club, that’s including the Championship. It would be great to get everyone on board. We’ve got a concept that can work with any club in the world.”Some of the shop’s best selling items are art prints of Subbuteo players from the Irish League or national team in kits from the eras in which they played. Another popular line sees a selection of classic kits displayed on coasters, mugs, T-shirts and art prints.And for those who like memorabilia they can wear the shop has a great range of old shirts, some match-worn.The strike partners leading the retro football revolution in Northern Ireland talked about some of their key team mates in their bid to climb the commercial ladder.Ryan said: “Tom Woodsdoes the Subbuteo prints. I approached him way back in the summer. I saw what he was doing with teams all over the UK. I commissioned him to do the Northern Ireland one which is a fantastic seller for us. “It’s kits from ious eras worn by  of the best ever players – there’s nothing like this available anywhere .“For the Subbuteo designs the club sends us photos of the players, we send them onto Tom and he works his magic. “We’ve also got him to do some Irish Leagues teams that we’ve teamed up with.” Pete continued: “With Hally Designs, they produce artwork featuring classic kits and you can turn them into prints or coasters or mugs or T-shirts. “They also do art prints of classic moments like when we beat England -. “We persuaded them to branch into the Irish League.”Ryan said: “There’s always new ideas out there, new brands to team up with.”In one of the framed prints by Hally Designs I spot the dubious yellow Broomhill kit which Glenavon wore in . It’s a kit I still own, but can’t recall wearing this side of the millennium.“Some of the worst kits are the best loved,” commented Ryan. “Some of them are an acquired taste. The fans love the Cltonville Kit Kat kit, we keep selling out of that on the coasters.”As well as the bespoke printed items, the shop is home to an array of old football programmes and some rare football shirts.Pete, an Arsenal fan, is particularly proud the shop has recently acquired the club’s yellow and blue ‘bruised banana’ away kit from - as well as a ‘Bergkamp ’ Holland shirt from .He said: “Bergkamp was the top man for me. It’ll pain me to sell those shirts but that’s how a business works.”Ryan said: “When I say we get shirts from all over the world I’m not trying to be vague, they genuinely come from all over the world. “There’s a Linfield top in there I got from Hong Kong. We’ve worked with collectors in Thailand, we’ve got stuff from America. “We get stuff locally as well, for example we sold a ‘ Red Star Belgrade top that had belonged to a guy who lived just outside Belfast. It was bought by someone in Miami, Florida. That shirt has done some miles.“There’s a Rangers match-worn Alex Cleland in there with number two on the back. It came from a collector in Asia.“We do get requests from people looking for specic shirts. There’s a network of collectors you can put a message out to and see what people have.”Of the resurgence in the Irish League that has helped boost the sales of memorabilia, Pete said: “We’re finding a lot of people are coming back to Glentoran and there’s been a big cash injection at Larne. “Some matches are on BBC, some on Sky Sports. You are getting good crowds again, it’s coming back.“Just last week we sold a the Glentoran home kit from - by auction for £. I reckon it would have cost about £ to £ at the time.“The Irish League is our bread and butter, but we want to branch out into the lower leagues in England and Scotland. “We’d especially love to get our own club Bangor on board. There’s a big fanbase still there.”Ryan said: “We’ve spoken to a few Irish League players on Twitter – we’ve got feedback from Joe Gormley and Liam Boyce, they both like their versions on the Cltonville Subbuteo print.”Ryan continued: “We don’t come from a retail background, we’re just football fans.“Initially I was just emailing every address I could find, pitching to them and explaining what I was trying to do. Now we’re speaking to clubs on the phone.“Obviously George Best put Northern Ireland on the map but recently with us doing well in the Euros people are paying attention outside of here.”While the online shop is rising in prominence the lads are trying to spread the word that they have a physical shop in Smithfield as well. “So many people come in to the shop and say they didn’t know we were here,” said Ryan. “Now they’re coming once a month to see what new things we’ve got in. Word of mouth for us is massive, customers telling their friends.“In most sports shops in Northern Ireland you can only get the most recent kits from the main Premier League, European and Scottish teams. We’re trying to offer something a bit dferent.”\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world.

In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: ldquoIt has been a privilege to be headteacher of Dinas Powys Primary for so long.ldquoEvery day is dferent, bringing its own rewards and challenges.ldquoI have witnessed the great success of our pupils and now have the wonderful experience of over  children of our past pupils attending our school.ldquoThe whole team of staff ensures the best possible opportunities are provided for all our lovely children.ldquoIt is dficult to choose a single highlight. I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: \"The Historical Environments Division is a section of the Department for Communities whose responsibility is to protect historical sites in Northern Ireland and therefore safeguard our heritage.In respect to Knock Iveagh on the outskirts of Rathfriland - a prehistoric burial site date back to  years BC and the site where the inauguration of medieval Irish Kings took place - the HED has failed and they have failed miserably. In fact had it not been for the ‘Friends of Knock Iveagh’, a public interest group, this Neolithic site would have destroyed by development that should never have been allowed.\"Having asked written questions of both the Ministers for the Communities and Infrastructure it is clear that their failing from  has led us to a situation where they have now passed the issue onto Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough council planners.\"This has put the local government planners in a dficult position. If they were to apply enforcement orders on the developers on Knock Iveagh, the ones that were given permission to develop by the Department for Infrastructure and were not stopped by the Department for the Communities, then there may be a massive compensation or legal cost for such action and that will be passed to the rate payers of the local council area. \"How can it be fair that the rate payers of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon could pick up the cost of the failings by DfC and DfI.\"It is time that both DfI and DfC - who have the powers to put Knock Iveagh back to the way it was before they mistakenly gave authority for a wind turbine development - to step up and take the financial responsibility for their mistakes. The government sponsored vandalism of a site scheduled for protection under the Historical and Archaeological Objects Order is a disgrace but allowing local council to pick up the cost compounds the damage started in  and should not be acceptable.\"A Department for Infrastructurespokesman said: “Councils are responsible for the proper administration and lawful processing of their own planning and or enforcement cases. The Department recognises the concerns and strength of feeling but, under the Transition Provisions for the transfer of the majority of planning s to the new Councils in April , responsibility for planning application permission does now lie with the Council. “The planning and enforcement issues in what is a highly complex case are also a matter for the Council. “A spokesperson for ABC Council said: “The Council is currently considering a number of Planning matters in relation to the site at Knockiveagh including requests to revoke discontinue planning permission for the wind turbine.“All of these planning matters remain under consideration at the present time,” said the spokesperson.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_2743935.jpg--.jpg?1581604995000\\","title":"no one located after multi agency search of strule river ","story":"Police received a report of a concern for safety in the Drumragh Avenue area of Omagh in the early hours of this morning .

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector. By supporting innovative initiatives like Manufacturing Month NI, we are showcasing the best and brightest in one of our most important industries.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cath1.jpg","title":"belfast city centre pubs facing m rates surge","story":"Posted on Thursday  January  by John Mulgrew The heart of Belfast’s pub and hotel scene could see rates bills soar by % and have a “crippling effect on the area” – amounting to an additional £.m a year – as part of a government revaluation, Ulster Business can reveal.A study of almost two dozen hospitality businesses in the popular Cathedral Quarter area – one of the main destinations for tourists visiting Belfast – could see a rates increase on average of almost % for pubs, while hotels in the area could see bills rise by more than a third.A survey of  bars shows the total expected rates bills could rise by £, a year, while five hotels in the area could see them in total rise by £,.It’s claimed the surge could have knock on effect on the area, including rising prices for the consumer. The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
