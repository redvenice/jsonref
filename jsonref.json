There was no music.\u0027The man, described as white, chubby and around 26, left after the pub\u0027\u0027s manager told him to go.\u0027He started staring in the gates at George Michael\u0027s house.

Next thing we see this blonde guy chasing the guy down the street, it was Jamie Oliver.\u0027It was crazy.  He sprinted down the street with three guys, who looked like security guards, pinned him to the ground in the car park with his arm behind his back.\u0027The guy didn\u0027t react much, still looked very dazed. Jamie\u0027s got lots of kids to worry about so fair enough\u0027.      One neighbour on the father-of-five\u0027s street in Highgate (pictured), north London, said: \u0027It was just a brave, selfless thing to do\u0027The criminal, who had apparently tried to break into several other lavish homes on the same street in North London, was arrested by police. A Met Police spokesman said: \u0027At 7.15pm on Tuesday, September 4, police were called to reports of an aggressive male attempting to gain entry to residential addresses.\u0027The male was apprehended by members of the public and was subsequently detained by police. He was taken to a north London police station and was subsequently released with no further action.\u0027When asked why the suspect would be released the spokesman would not comment on Jamie Oliver\u0027s specific case, but said: \u0027It could be for any number of reasons such as lack of evidence or he could have had mental health problems.\u0027  It came as it was revealed the police \u0027screened out\u0027 more than 34,000 crimes last year on the day they were reported, compared to just over 13,000 the year before. The raider tried to break into Jamie\u0027s £8.9million, eight-bedroom mansion and other homes along the exclusive street. Other stars believed to live on the road include Kate Moss and Jude Law, although the actor told MailOnline today he didn\u0027t know about Jamie\u0027s heroics.His wife Jools, 43, and their five children, Poppy, 16, Daisy, 15, Petal, nine, Buddy, 7, River, two, were all in the house at the time.Mrs Oliver said this morning: \u0027I don\u0027t really want to comment any further.

Everyone is really thankful for his quick thinking and courage.\u0027           Jamie was at home with his wife Jools (pictured) and five children - Poppy, 16, Daisy, 15, Petal, nine, Buddy, seven, and two-year-old River - at the time of the break-in on Tuesday eveningAnother source told the Daily Mirror last night: \u0027It was understandably very scary as Jamie was with the whole family in his house at the time.

It is also the surname both princes used during their time in the military. However, upon marriage to Kate Middleton, Prince William became the Duke of Cambridge meaning that his three children will likely follow the tradition of using the father’s title as the surname. This means that should the Duke and Duchess follow the Royal Family tradition, their children will use their father’s title, Sussex as the surname.In the same way, Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice use the surname York, after their father’s title Prince Andrew, the Duke of York.Since 1960, the Queen’s children and her descendants would also be allowed to use the surname of Mountbatten-Windsor. However, the Royal Family website confirms: ‘For the most part, members of the Royal Family who are entitled to the style and dignity of HRH Prince or Princess do not need a surname, but if at any time any of them do need a surname (such as upon marriage), that surname is Mountbatten-Windsor.’Caio Fernando Abreu is celebrated in a Google Doodle for September 12I\u0027m A Celebrity 2018: Malique Thompson-Dwyer revealed after producers confirm Hollyoaks star in lineup EuroMillions results: National Lottery numbers for Tuesday, 11 SeptemberWho is Romano Fenati?

The MAC was asked by the Government to carry out analysis of the impact of international students on the UK\u0027s education system, economy and societyWhile the lowest quarter of British masters graduates had average earnings of £20,500, the figure for those from outside the EU was just £15,400. The MAC said many responses to a call for evidence wanted a more generous post-study work regime.Currently, PhD visas allow students to remain in the UK for four months after expected course completion, although to an extension scheme that permits a year of work.Masters students also have up to four months, except those in a pilot programme allowing six months.The MAC recommended that PhD students automatically get one year\u0027s leave to remain after finishing their courses.It proposed an extension to six months for all Masters students, but called for a \u0027more thorough\u0027 review of whether this is appropriate.In a finding the Committee acknowledged would disappoint the higher education sector, it did not recommend a separate post-study work visa scheme.On the Government\u0027s net migration target, which has never been met, the report said removing students \u0027would be difficult technically and, if done correctly, would make almost no difference to the net migration figures\u0027.However, it suggested there may be an \u0027image problem\u0027 fuelled by \u0027repeated discussions\u0027 of students in the net migration target.\u0027If there is a problem with students in the net migration target, it is with the target itself rather than the inclusion of students in that target,\u0027 Prof Manning said.\u0027Summarising migration policy through the net migration target may give the impression that the government seeks to reduce the net migration of all types of migrants including students.\u0027 The report pointed out that other countries did not calculate equivalent net migration figures that were used to set targets.It added: \u0027The net migration target is a political target and the IPS net migration figure does not have to form the basis of the government\u0027s net migration target.           The report was commissioned last year by then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd (pictured), who was leading the campaign in Cabinet to persuade Mrs May to back down\u0027The government could choose to use other data sources to set targets related to migration, such as visa or settlement statistics. Or it could choose not to have a target at all and summarise its ambitions on net migration in a different way.\u0027The Committee also concluded international student numbers should remain uncapped.Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of campaign group Migration Watch UK, welcomed the \u0027excellent\u0027 report.He said: \u0027The MAC endorsement of the inclusion of students in the migration statistics should put this issue to bed. It is also right that the post-study work regime should remain carefully policed.\u0027A Home Office spokesman said: \u0027As this report makes clear, international students play an important and positive role in our education system, economy and society.\u0027We are committed to ensuring we continue to attract the best international students.\u0027Professor Dame Janet Beer, president of Universities UK, said: \u0027While the report recognises the enormous contribution international students make to life in the UK, we are disappointed with its main recommendations.\u0027We agree that the Government and the sector should continue to work together to grow the number of international students, but growth will only be possible if we have an immigration system that encourages talented international students to choose the UK.\u0027    "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/16/4FDC941A00000578-6155781-image-a-2_1536679079862.jpg","title":"Who Daniel Zhang Alibaba CEO replacement revealed Jack Ma reveals stepping down","story":"    Zhang will succeed Jack Ma as executive chairman of the Alibaba Group in September 2019Who is Daniel Zhang?Daniel Zhang is a businessman slated to take over as executive chairman of Alibaba, succeeding Jack Ma.He was born in Shanghai, China on January 11, 1972.After studying finance at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Zhang served as the chief executive officer of the Chinese video game company Shanda Interactive Entertainment and also as a high-level manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers’s Shanghai office.Zhang joined Alibaba subsidiary Taobao in 2007 as its chief financial officer.

During the 16th and 17th centuries it belonged to the Snede family, being the dower house for Keele. It is believed some 22 members of that family were born here.In the middle of the 18th century it was bought by a lawyer, John Sparrow, who became the first chairman of the Stafford quarter sessions, famously preventing a massacre of Stafford residents at Radford Bank. He was also High Sherriff of the county, a position later held by Cecil Stafford Northcote whilst at Bishton.Upon John Sparrow’s death, ownership passed to his eldest daughter, Charlotte. She never married but is still remembered today by the children of Colwich school which she founded. She added the east and west wings of the house in about 1820.The Stafford Northcotes moved here in 1946 and made it into St Bede’s School. Many pupils have gone on to lead distinguished careers taking with them a unique experience of family-orientated school life and fun. There have been five babies born at Bishton Hall. The family, a branch of the Earls of Iddlesley of Devon, have always been keen collectors of fine art and furniture.The sale of the contents of Bishton Hall contains many of these items, including Indian chests which travelled around their country of origin on the backs of elephants. They contained personal belongings and government documents belonging to a family member, Shadwell Boulderson, who was a district commissioner.Another member of that same family, all members of the East India company, owned a ship, the Marquis of Landsdown, a painting of which can be seen hanging in the Staircase Hall.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/19/5008745300000578-0-Three_years_ago_Penman_and_Capestro_pictured_above_together_were-a-32_1536691116886.jpg","title":"Woman 9 11 photo marries 17 years photographed man took photo day","story":"    Joanne ‘Jojo’ Capestro escaped from the 87th floor of the World Trade Center\u0027s North Tower on September 11, 2001 before fleeing to the debris and dust covered streets of lower Manhattan with a coworker.

The Mail revealed yesterday that the NHS is to put diabetics on low-calorie soup and shake diets to try to beat the disease‘However this is hardly surprising when we live in an environment that steers us towards unhealthy choices with marketing, promotions and super-size portions.‘We need the Government to fully implement measures outlined in their childhood obesity strategy such as a 9pm watershed on junk food adverts to help ensure the next generation have the opportunity to grow up healthy.’Helen Dickens of Diabetes UK said the figures from WHO were very worrying. She added: ‘Obesity is one of the main risk factors of Type 2 diabetes, and the reason why 12.3million people in the UK are at risk of developing the condition.‘We need to tackle the obesity epidemic in order to stop the Type 2 diabetes crisis from growing, by helping people make healthier choices and supporting them to maintain a healthy lifestyle.’          People need to make healthier choices and support them to maintain a healthy lifestyleThe Mail revealed yesterday that the NHS is to put diabetics on low-calorie soup and shake diets to try to beat the disease.A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Our regulations on junk food advertising to children are some of the toughest in the world – while our soft drinks industry levy has removed billions of tons of sugar from children’s diets.‘We recently set out proposals to ban energy drinks for children and plans are under way to reduce their exposure to sugary food and get them moving more in school.’The WHO study, which covers data up to 2016, showed Britons consume 24 per cent more alcohol than the European average.A BMI score is a rough calculation based on the relationship between an inidual’s weight and height.  I cut out beer and curry to reverse my diabetes – and lost 7st, says Labour’s Tom WatsonTom Watson reversed his Type 2 diabetes by cutting out beer and curry, he revealed last night. The Labour deputy leader lost 98lbs in weight – seven stone – after he adopted a radical diet and took up boxing.‘I am very happy to reveal that my Type 2 diabetes has been reversed, it’s in remission,’ said the 51-year-old. ‘No longer having to take medicines for diabetes is a joy. To all Type 2 diabetics I say: “Yes, we can.”‘Yet the tragedy for many is that they don’t even know their condition is reversible, let alone how to achieve it.’Writing in the Daily Express, Mr Watson said he realised his problem last year as he ‘huffed and puffed’ to his Westminster office. ‘It felt that if I didn’t do this, I was going to die,’ he said. He cut out all sugar and ultra-processed food from his diet and started walking and running and then boxing.‘Politicians of all sides must join forces to enact change,’ he said. ‘My experience of escaping Type 2 diabetes has given me a new mission to help others get healthy.‘We can’t afford to keep going as we are.

Jaguar Land Rover may be forced to stop building cars in Britain if Theresa May fails to strike the ‘right’ Brexit deal, the company’s boss warned yesterday.In a hard-hitting speech addressed directly to the Prime Minister, Ralf Speth (pictured, right) claimed tens of thousands of jobs could be lost across the car industry.Earlier this summer the car giant outlined plans to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in upgrading its plants in Solihull in the West Midlands and Halewood in Merseyside to build to the next versions of hybrid and electric Range Rover models.Dr Speth said ‘unfettered access’ to the EU’s single market was as crucial to its business as ‘wheels are to our cars’.Without it, he said production in Britain could grind to a halt, putting many of JLR’s 44,000 employees at risk.Speaking at the Government’s Zero Emission Vehicle summit in Birmingham as Mrs May prepared to take the stage, Dr Speth said: ‘Brexit is due to happen on the 29th of March next year. Currently, I do not even know if any of our manufacturing facilities in the UK will be able to function on the 30th.‘Like many British companies our supply chains reach deep into Europe. Bluntly, we will not be able to build cars, if the motorway to and from Dover becomes a car park, where the vehicle carrying parts – vital to our processes – is stationary.’JLR is already in the process of opening a new £1billion plant in Nitra, Slovakia, where its new Land Rover Discovery is being built. The decision to shift production from Birmingham – putting hundreds of jobs at risk – was announced in June.But Mr Speth hinted that this could be just the start, warning that it is already ‘thousands of pounds cheaper to produce vehicles in Slovakia than Solihull’ due to higher costs and the UK’s ‘poor productivity rates’.The Prime Minister’s spokesman said her Chequers Brexit plan included proposals to protect jobs in areas that rely on ‘just-in-time’ supply chains.He insisted it would ‘help ensure frictionless trade with the EU and would see our car sector to continue to flourish’."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/22/500B16C600000578-0-image-a-37_1536701252559.jpg","title":"The REAL Lady Overly familiar presidents blundering officials","story":"    Gerald Ford dancing with Queen Elizabeth II at the ball at the White House, Washington, during the 1976 Bicentennial Celebrations of the Declaration of IndependenceFor her very first trip to Florida — part of her 1991 state visit to America — the Royal Yacht had sailed in to Miami to rendezvous with the Queen.As Britannia\u0027s crew waited to greet her, they flushed through all the royal baths and heads (ship\u0027s lavatories), which was standard practice ahead of a royal arrival. Whereupon Britannia\u0027s captain suddenly had a furious official from the Miami port authority thumping on his door.The crew had just breached strict environmental regulations and the captain was handed a $10,000 (£7,700) fine plus an order to leave port within two hours.No matter that the Queen was due to host a state banquet on board that very evening, with two former U.S. presidents among the guests. Rules were rules. The Yacht would have to pack up and go.It was only after the direct intervention of the White House that Britannia was allowed to remain alongside. The banquet duly took place without further incident. The fabled \u0027special relationship\u0027 had worked its magic once again.It\u0027s a phrase, however, which is heard more often on this side of the Atlantic and there are commentators in both Britain and the U.S. who regard any notion of a \u0027special relationship\u0027 as sentimental, subservient wishful thinking on the part of the British Establishment.There have certainly been some strong inidual pairings between No 10 and the White House, notably Churchill and Roosevelt, Thatcher and Reagan and, latterly, Blair and George W. Bush.          Queen Elizabeth II rides on horseback with American President Ronald Reagan in Windsor, June 1982However, historians will note that there has been a more subtle, yet more consistent, \u0027special relationship\u0027 operating between the White House and Buckingham Palace throughout the reign of Elizabeth II — even during periods of deep political ision.Unlike the Queen\u0027s dealings with most countries, which have followed a well-established pattern, this is a friendship that has broken the bilateral mould. There can be few people in the U.S., let alone the rest of the world, who have lived through the administrations of 16 presidents — more than one-third of the total — and met 12 of them.Of the handful of private foreign holidays that the Queen has enjoyed in her life (all horse-related), five have been spent in the U.S.And in 2018, the Royal Family welcomed their first American Princess. Yet the Queen\u0027s own \u0027special relationship\u0027 goes back to the nursery.It was in 1939 that her parents travelled to Canada and the U.S. to bolster support for Britain ahead of impending hostilities in Europe. The royals rather enjoyed all the informality.The Queen wrote an excited letter to her daughters about a memorable picnic lunch: \u0027All our food on one plate — a little salmon, some turkey, some ham, lettuce, beans \u0026amp HOT DOGS too!\u0027While some Americans were appalled at the idea of serving hot dogs to a king, the Royal Family would never forget it.Growing up in wartime Windsor, Princess Elizabeth was acutely aware of the strain on her father as he tried to buoy the morale of a nation facing invasion at any moment, and she could sense the redemptive significance of America\u0027s entry into the war.          Queen Elizabeth signs on behalf of her dominion of Canada during the conclusion of the Power Project Ceremonies at the New York state end of the St. Lawrence Power DamCome victory and the drab, near-bankrupt years of austerity that followed, it was America that represented fun and glamour.Like so many others, the Princesses were entranced by the explosive arrival of the first American musical after the war, Oklahoma!Princess Margaret reportedly went to see it more than 30 times. Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip watched it together as a courting couple in 1947 People Will Say We\u0027re in Love has been one of \u0027their\u0027 songs ever since.The Queen\u0027s first experience of the U.S. was in 1951, when as Princess Elizabeth she interrupted a tour of Canada to meet President Harry Truman at the White House. Her first visit as Queen came in 1957 when she met President Dwight D. Eisenhower as well as the then-Vice-President Richard Nixon.Alongside formalities to mark the 350th anniversary of the first English colony at Jamestown, Virginia, the Queen and the Duke paid their first visit to a supermarket.           Pictured: The Queen of the World by Robert Hardman \u0027How nice you can bring your children along,\u0027 she told shoppers as she marvelled at the sight of a frozen-food section.Food was also on the agenda in 1959 when the Queen first entertained a U.S. president at home. Spending two days with the monarch at Balmoral, President Eisenhower found the experience so agreeable that he asked the Queen for \u0027her\u0027 scone recipe (though not her own, she duly transcribed it in her own hand).Disagreements after the Suez Crisis and then over Vietnam would strain the \u0027special relationship\u0027 on the political front, but not the rapport between the Windsors and the White House.In 1976, Gerald Ford invited the Queen across the Atlantic for a tumultuous state visit to honour the bicentenary of American independence. She was accompanied by her new Foreign Secretary, Anthony Crosland, and his American-born wife, who later recorded the Queen\u0027s advice on how to get through arduous tours like these.\u0027One plants one\u0027s feet like this,\u0027 the Queen told her. \u0027Always keep them parallel. Make sure your weight is evenly distributed. That\u0027s all there is to it.\u0027The advice would be invaluable, with a punishing itinerary in 100f (38c) heat. The centrepiece was a White House state banquet for more than 200 guests, including Hollywood stars Cary Grant, Telly Savalas and Merle Oberon.There was some amusement when the after-dinner cabaret, pop duo Captain \u0026amp Tennille, launched into their moderately risque hit Muskrat Love. That turned to considerable unamusement when President Ford invited the Queen to dance. The band chose that very moment to strike up a new tune: The Lady Is A Tramp.There was an even more awkward moment when Ford\u0027s successor arrived at Buckingham Palace a year later. Perhaps overcome with nerves on what was his first journey outside the U.S., Jimmy Carter became a little over-familiar with a senior member of the Royal Family.As William Shawcross notes in her official biography, the Queen Mother hated being told that she reminded people of their own mothers. Having informed her that she did, indeed, remind him of his own mother — \u0027Miz Lillian\u0027 — President Carter kissed the Queen Mother on the lips. As she later remarked, no one had done that since the death of George VI. \u0027I took a sharp step backwards,\u0027 she recalled, \u0027not far enough.\u0027Carter\u0027s successor, however, would enjoy one of the more enduring friendships between the Queen and any foreign politician. It certainly helped that Ronald Reagan was an accomplished horseman. When he came to Windsor Castle for a semi-private stay in 1982, the two heads of state spent a good hour riding all over Windsor Great Park followed by teams of bodyguards — on both four legs and four wheels.On a return trip to the U.S. in 1983, the Queen fulfilled a lifetime\u0027s ambition of touring the West Coast. In Hollywood, Reagan laid on a star-packed lunch for 500. The entertainment included Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope and Perry Como, but the arrangements left some of the local talent rather peeved.\u0027Ronald Reagan was asked who should be at the top table,\u0027 recalls Sir Brian Fall, then private secretary to the British Foreign Secretary, Francis Pym. \u0027Should it be actor friends or political friends? He couldn\u0027t sort it out so he said: \u0027Why don\u0027t we pack it out with Brits in Hollywood?\u0027 \u0027The result was a top table full of British-born stars such as Julie Andrews and Dudley Moore. For some status-obsessed Hollywood egos, it was all too much. The Palace press office, which had played no part in the planning, was left fending off accusations that the Queen was only interested in sitting with fellow Brits.          Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh this afternoon arrived in Washington D.C. where they were greeted by President Eisenhower\u0027I was on the table next door with Julie Andrews\u0027s husband,\u0027 Sir Brian recalls. \u0027He was so ticked off at not being on the right table that he walked off and left a gap.\u0027A few days later the Queen was due to arrive in San Francisco on Britannia, but foul weather persuaded her to fly instead. The Reagans put Air Force Two at her disposal and staff recall a very excited Queen pressing her face against a plane window to enjoy an aerial view of the Golden Gate Bridge.With no Royal Yacht to stay on, the combined power of the White House, the Palace and the personal contacts of the former state governor found the Queen and the Duke last-minute accommodation in the Presidential Suite at the St Francis Hotel, where Nancy Reagan even arranged for works of art from local museums to be rounded up and hung on the walls.\u0027The next question was: where to go for dinner?\u0027 remembers Sir Brian. Again the White House came to the rescue and managed to empty San Francisco\u0027s most famous restaurant, Trader Vic\u0027s, for the night. For the Queen, who had not eaten in a restaurant for 15 years, it was a novel experience, right down to being given a fortune cookie at the end (she read the message and then put it in her handbag).The \u0027special relationship\u0027 was still in robust shape following the first Gulf War as the Queen and Prince Philip arrived to stay with President George H. W. Bush in 1991.However, the state visit got off to an inauspicious start following President Bush\u0027s formal welcome on the White House lawn. After his speech, he was supposed to press a pedal which raised the platform from which the Queen was then going to speak.‘It’s satire, if you don’t like it you don’t have to read...Brits with less than six months on their passport could face...Share this article He forgot to do it and the Queen, being rather shorter, remained invisible to much of the crowd.The moment was encapsulated in the words of NBC\u0027s Jim Miklaszewski: \u0027She\u0027s gone! All I got is a talking hat!\u0027 To this day, Palace officials and diplomats still refer to the state visit as \u0027the talking hat tour\u0027.D uring her stay in Washington, the Queen had her first encounter with the President\u0027s son, George W. Bush, then in charge of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He had been forewarned by his mother not to talk to the Queen, as he could be \u0027mercurial\u0027.The Queen was rather intrigued, particularly since he was wearing cowboy boots etched with the words \u0027God Save The Queen\u0027. At one point she asked him if he was the black sheep of the family.\u0027I guess so,\u0027 replied Bush Junior.\u0027All families have them,\u0027 observed the Queen.\u0027Who\u0027s yours?\u0027 Bush Junior replied, at which point the First Lady, Barbara Bush, intervened with a cry of: \u0027Don\u0027t answer that!\u0027Relations between London and Washington cooled to a more business-like level during the Clinton years, partly because of heated disagreements over the Western response to war in Bosnia.There was no state visit in either direction in that sort of climate, but the Queen fulfilled her now-familiar role as keeper of the \u0027special relationship\u0027.The Clintons might not have had the full royal treatment at Windsor or Buckingham Palace but, in 1994, they were the Queen\u0027s guests for the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of D-Day.Only the Clintons were invited to stay aboard Britannia in Portsmouth ahead of the voyage to France the next day, accompanied by the leaders of all the allied nations and ocean liners packed with veterans.

However, it was Andrew Parker Bowles whom the Prince should have been most grateful to see.The 40-year-old Army officer had taken it upon himself to double-check every section of the royal itinerary.This included a trip to the Henderson Veterinary Research Station at Mazowe, where the vets were so convinced that they had found a way to tame the notoriously irascible African buffalo, a creature responsible for at least 200 deaths each year, that they were going to invite the Prince to ride one.

According to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation, the women, in their late teens or early 20s, met De La Hoya on a dating website in February and began messaging with him on Snapchat. The multi-millionaire former boxing champion and Golden Boy Promotions chairman then invited the women back to his luxury condominium in downtown Pasadena, California. The property inside The Montana building, which De La Hoya snapped up in 2017 for $2.65 million, boasts 4,150 square feet of luxurious interior space, three bedrooms, a patio and a wine cellar. Once there, it\u0027s claimed the women partied with the star before filming him on a cell phone in various \u0027embarrassing\u0027 sexual situations.

But it was clear to me Oscar had been set up. \u0027The girls even took a picture of his driver\u0027s license to prove it was him, they knew what they were doing, almost as if they had done this before. \u0027In my mind it was outright extortion and I cut ties with them immediately.\u0027 Blatt said he has reached out to De La Hoya\u0027s people and is aware that the FBI is involved, adding he\u0027d be willing to assist in any investigation. A source close to Moakler, who asked not to be named, told DailyMail.com that the former Playboy model turned reality star was interviewed by FBI investigators for two hours on Monday. The source said the incident had caused much distress to her and De La Hoya.\u0027It was very intimidating, they said they wanted $2million or they would release the tape everywhere,\u0027 the source said. \u0027But Shanna stood firm and called their bluff, she told them, \u0027go ahead release it, I don\u0027t care.\u0027 \u0027Then she immediately called Oscar and they decided to go to the authorities. It\u0027s in the hands of the FBI now, they have already interviewed Shanna.\u0027           De La Hoya invited the two women to his luxury condo in Pasadena, California where they partied with the boxer and filmed him in \u0027embarrassing\u0027 sexual situations           In one scene, the women are seen performing sex acts on him with kitchen utensils.

Moakler declined to comment. De La Hoya is no stranger to this kind of controversy. In 2007, he was the subject of a photo scandal when snaps showing the champ clad in fishnets, panties and high heels were splashed online. Serbian stripper Milana Dravnel released the photos and claimed De La Hoya had cheated on his wife with her. At the time De La Hoya\u0027s camp claimed it wasn\u0027t him in the photos and that the stripper was \u0027out for money.\u0027 His team even brought in their own \u0027photo expert,\u0027 who said the snaps were a computer-generated forgery.          In 2007, he was the subject of a photo scandal when snaps showing the champ clad in fishnets, panties and high heels were splashed onlineDravnel, who released the photos, later filed a $100million lawsuit against De La Hoya claiming he unleashed a smear campaign against her to stop the photos from emerging. The case was later settled and in 2011 De La Hoya gave a tell-all interview in which he admitted \u0027It was me\u0027 in the photos. \u0027Let me to tell you, yes, yes, it was me,\u0027 he told Spanish TV network Univision. During the interview the troubled sportsman also revealed his long battle with drugs and alcohol. Stormy Daniels is cooperating with investigators probing...Georgina Chapman leaves townhouse that her disgraced husband...Share this articleAnd then in 2011 De La Hoya was hit with another lawsuit in which it was claimed he threw a depraved, cross-dressing, drug-driven orgy at New York\u0027s Ritz Carlton Hotel. New York model Angelica Marie Cecora, then 25, said the retired boxer cavorted around in women\u0027s underwear and went crazy with cocaine and sex toys, intimidating her and her friend when they tried to leave. But a judge ultimately dismissed the $5 million suit and ordered Cecora to pay De La Hoya\u0027s legal bills. The judge also ordered her and her lawyer to pay a $500 fine each for filing a \u0027frivolous\u0027 lawsuit and said the allegations were without merit. De la Joya\u0027s representatives have not responded to requests for comment from DailyMail.com Oscar De La Hoya Considering Running for President!!! | TMZ.com"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/12/06/5005DAD100000578-6158131-image-a-11_1536730006996.jpg","title":"Strong 5 2 earthquake rocks Turkish tourist destination Antalya","story":"    The quake hit just after 6.20am UTC on Wednesday,  around 40 miles off the coast Tekirova in the Antalya province, Turkey\u0027Very significant long lasting shaking - quite violent building shaking lasting a good time.

The gang declined in power by the 1910s and was eventually all but destroyed in 1917 with the death of its leader and arrest of its commanding figures          Mulberry Bend, one of the most dangerous areas controlled by the Five Points gangs pictured in 1896 at the height of gang influence in the area.

Sometimes considered the original American melting pot, this run-down Manhattan district became the centre of settlement for the poorest and least fortunate immigrants. Irish, Italian and Eastern European immigrants and freed Black slaves settled in Five Points.Gambling dens and brothels were numerous in the Five Points area, and it was considered a dangerous destination, where many people had been mugged particularly at night and where race riots would regularly break out. In 1842, Charles Dickens famously visited the area and was appalled by the terrible living conditions.At the height of occupation of Five Points, only certain areas of London\u0027s East End vied with it in the western world for population density, disease, child mortality, prostitution and crime.Five Points was a place where life was short and violent and the place where the original gangs of New York were formed.          A gang of young boys demonstrate how they make their living for the camera, by robbing drunk men who have passed out in the middle of the street. Pick-pocketing was one of the main rackets controlled by gangs in the Five Points who would ide up the loot from successful robberies. Alcoholism and poverty went hand-in-hand in the neighborhood which meant crude techniques like the one pictures were devastatingly effective and allowed thieves to easily get away with the crime          A busy street scene outside a hatters shop in the Five Points district of Manhattan in 1880 when gang violence was at an all-time high. Although the neighborhood was shrouded in suspicion and criminal activity there were a number of legitimate businesses which ran alongside the day-to-day organised crime syndicates. Shops like this hatters lined the busy shopping streets which were both a hub for criminals and for local business leaders  A crime scene photo at Bottle Alley, the headquarters of the Irish-American Whyos Gang.

After becoming a predominantly Irish neighborhood during a wave of immigration in the 1860s, the Five Points found a new Italian influence thrust upon the area with a new wave of arrivals in the 1880s. Some of the new Italian immigrants had connections within the Mafia and were experienced crime bosses back in their old countryOrganized criminal gangs, like the Bowery Boys, the Dead Rabbits, the Short Tails, the Gopher Gang, the Whyos Gang and the Montgomery Guards cropped up across Manhattan.Each group had had their own way of letting people know who they stood with. The Bowery Boys, a gang mainly made up of firefighters, would go out in red shirts and stovepipe hats the Short Tails went out with their shirt untucked and the Irish Dead Rabbits would head out with a rabbit nailed to a stick.Meanwhile the Whyos - an Irish-American criminal group who ranged from pickpockets to murderers - had a distinctive gang\u0027s cry which sounded like a bird or owl calling \u0027Why-oh!\u0027 to let people know they were on the streets.All of the gangs of Five Points competed for control of the revenue made from illicit activities and fights would break out over most anything.The Five Points gangs made their neighborhood one of the deadliest places on earth. It was said that they had the highest murder rate of any slum in the world. According to the legends, the most dangerous building - a housing tenement called the \u0027Old Brewery\u0027 - saw a murder every single night.          The Short Tail Gang, a violent group of thugs and one of the most feared of the Five Points gangs, was reportedly known to the police for being \u0027hard drinkers, highwaymen and thieves\u0027. They were recognisable in the streets around the Five Points because of their distinctive style of dressing. They can be seen here wearing their characteristic short-tailed coats which gave the gang its name          One of four men sharing a single cellar beneath a tenement home, circa 1880.

The Whyos were so called because they made a distinctive call to one another where they shouted \u0027Why-o\u0027 in the street to mark themselves out as gang membersAbove all, it was nationality and race that turned the Five Points gangs against one another. Riots and fights broke out between the staunchly anti-Catholic Bowery Boys and the Irish Dead Rabbits.In one brutal two-day battle, an estimated 1,000 people took to the streets of New York to fight, beating each other senseless and looting one another\u0027s homes. By the time the blood had dried, eight men were dead and up to a hundred more lay injured - an event that inspired Martin Scorsese\u0027s 2002 film Gangs of New York.For a century, these notorious gangs ruled their neighbourhood but by the early 1900s, Five Points was torn down piece by piece. Politicians railed for it to be ripped apart with one telling his constituent, \u0027This hot-bed of infamy, this modern Sodom, is situated in the very heart of your City!\u0027  The crime-riddled Old Brewery was pulled down, missionary houses were brought in, and bit by bit, the face of the city changed.The Five Points gangs were broken up and slowly faded into history. These images remember their notorious legacy.          Four homeless men lay passed out on the steps of a dilapidated home in the Five Points around 1880 when the neighborhood was its most impoverished. Various efforts by different charitable organizations and iniduals, most Christian themed, attempted to ameliorate the suffering of the poor in Five Points. Towards the beginning of the 20th century the area was completely redeveloped and upgraded          Inside of a tenement in Hell\u0027s Kitchen where several women and men are crowded into a small room and forced to wrap up in several layers to protect them from the cold. Disease was rife among the residents in the Five Points. The lack of scientific knowledge, sanitation systems, the numerous overcrowded dwellings, and absence of even rudimentary health care made impoverished areas such as Five Points ideal for the development and spread of these diseases          A cobbler taking a break from making shoes and eating some bread inside of a tenement in Five Points, New York city, circa 1880. Among the criminals, enterprising iniduals were able to flourish and the streets of the neighborhood were awash with craftsmen selling everything from hats to shoes and unique garments. Skilled laborers had come over from Ireland and Italy and were able to peddle their wares in New York as they had done in their old country          An illegal tenement in the neighborhood which crammed in residents for the price of five cents a spot despite the fact there was limited floor space. At the height of occupation of Five Points, only certain areas of London\u0027s East End vied with it in the western world for population density, disease, infant and child mortality, unemployment, prostitution, violent crime, and other classic ills of the urban destitute          Women lodge inside of the local police station during a typhus epidemic in the 1880s.

During the 16th and 17th centuries it belonged to the Snede family, being the dower house for Keele. It is believed some 22 members of that family were born here.In the middle of the 18th century it was bought by a lawyer, John Sparrow, who became the first chairman of the Stafford quarter sessions, famously preventing a massacre of Stafford residents at Radford Bank. He was also High Sherriff of the county, a position later held by Cecil Stafford Northcote whilst at Bishton.Upon John Sparrow’s death, ownership passed to his eldest daughter, Charlotte. She never married but is still remembered today by the children of Colwich school which she founded. She added the east and west wings of the house in about 1820.The Stafford Northcotes moved here in 1946 and made it into St Bede’s School. Many pupils have gone on to lead distinguished careers taking with them a unique experience of family-orientated school life and fun. There have been five babies born at Bishton Hall.

Jaguar Land Rover may be forced to stop building cars in Britain if Theresa May fails to strike the ‘right’ Brexit deal, the company’s boss warned yesterday.In a hard-hitting speech addressed directly to the Prime Minister, Ralf Speth (pictured, right) claimed tens of thousands of jobs could be lost across the car industry.Earlier this summer the car giant outlined plans to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in upgrading its plants in Solihull in the West Midlands and Halewood in Merseyside to build to the next versions of hybrid and electric Range Rover models.Dr Speth said ‘unfettered access’ to the EU’s single market was as crucial to its business as ‘wheels are to our cars’.Without it, he said production in Britain could grind to a halt, putting many of JLR’s 44,000 employees at risk.Speaking at the Government’s Zero Emission Vehicle summit in Birmingham as Mrs May prepared to take the stage, Dr Speth said: ‘Brexit is due to happen on the 29th of March next year. Currently, I do not even know if any of our manufacturing facilities in the UK will be able to function on the 30th.‘Like many British companies our supply chains reach deep into Europe. Bluntly, we will not be able to build cars, if the motorway to and from Dover becomes a car park, where the vehicle carrying parts – vital to our processes – is stationary.’JLR is already in the process of opening a new £1billion plant in Nitra, Slovakia, where its new Land Rover Discovery is being built. The decision to shift production from Birmingham – putting hundreds of jobs at risk – was announced in June.But Mr Speth hinted that this could be just the start, warning that it is already ‘thousands of pounds cheaper to produce vehicles in Slovakia than Solihull’ due to higher costs and the UK’s ‘poor productivity rates’.The Prime Minister’s spokesman said her Chequers Brexit plan included proposals to protect jobs in areas that rely on ‘just-in-time’ supply chains.He insisted it would ‘help ensure frictionless trade with the EU and would see our car sector to continue to flourish’."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/22/500B16C600000578-0-image-a-37_1536701252559.jpg","title":"The REAL Lady Overly familiar presidents blundering officials","story":"    Gerald Ford dancing with Queen Elizabeth II at the ball at the White House, Washington, during the 1976 Bicentennial Celebrations of the Declaration of IndependenceFor her very first trip to Florida — part of her 1991 state visit to America — the Royal Yacht had sailed in to Miami to rendezvous with the Queen.As Britannia\u0027s crew waited to greet her, they flushed through all the royal baths and heads (ship\u0027s lavatories), which was standard practice ahead of a royal arrival. Whereupon Britannia\u0027s captain suddenly had a furious official from the Miami port authority thumping on his door.The crew had just breached strict environmental regulations and the captain was handed a $10,000 (£7,700) fine plus an order to leave port within two hours.No matter that the Queen was due to host a state banquet on board that very evening, with two former U.S. presidents among the guests.

There can be few people in the U.S., let alone the rest of the world, who have lived through the administrations of 16 presidents — more than one-third of the total — and met 12 of them.Of the handful of private foreign holidays that the Queen has enjoyed in her life (all horse-related), five have been spent in the U.S.And in 2018, the Royal Family welcomed their first American Princess. Yet the Queen\u0027s own \u0027special relationship\u0027 goes back to the nursery.It was in 1939 that her parents travelled to Canada and the U.S. to bolster support for Britain ahead of impending hostilities in Europe. The royals rather enjoyed all the informality.The Queen wrote an excited letter to her daughters about a memorable picnic lunch: \u0027All our food on one plate — a little salmon, some turkey, some ham, lettuce, beans \u0026amp HOT DOGS too!\u0027While some Americans were appalled at the idea of serving hot dogs to a king, the Royal Family would never forget it.Growing up in wartime Windsor, Princess Elizabeth was acutely aware of the strain on her father as he tried to buoy the morale of a nation facing invasion at any moment, and she could sense the redemptive significance of America\u0027s entry into the war.          Queen Elizabeth signs on behalf of her dominion of Canada during the conclusion of the Power Project Ceremonies at the New York state end of the St. Lawrence Power DamCome victory and the drab, near-bankrupt years of austerity that followed, it was America that represented fun and glamour.Like so many others, the Princesses were entranced by the explosive arrival of the first American musical after the war, Oklahoma!Princess Margaret reportedly went to see it more than 30 times. Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip watched it together as a courting couple in 1947 People Will Say We\u0027re in Love has been one of \u0027their\u0027 songs ever since.The Queen\u0027s first experience of the U.S. was in 1951, when as Princess Elizabeth she interrupted a tour of Canada to meet President Harry Truman at the White House. Her first visit as Queen came in 1957 when she met President Dwight D. Eisenhower as well as the then-Vice-President Richard Nixon.Alongside formalities to mark the 350th anniversary of the first English colony at Jamestown, Virginia, the Queen and the Duke paid their first visit to a supermarket.           Pictured: The Queen of the World by Robert Hardman \u0027How nice you can bring your children along,\u0027 she told shoppers as she marvelled at the sight of a frozen-food section.Food was also on the agenda in 1959 when the Queen first entertained a U.S. president at home. Spending two days with the monarch at Balmoral, President Eisenhower found the experience so agreeable that he asked the Queen for \u0027her\u0027 scone recipe (though not her own, she duly transcribed it in her own hand).Disagreements after the Suez Crisis and then over Vietnam would strain the \u0027special relationship\u0027 on the political front, but not the rapport between the Windsors and the White House.In 1976, Gerald Ford invited the Queen across the Atlantic for a tumultuous state visit to honour the bicentenary of American independence. She was accompanied by her new Foreign Secretary, Anthony Crosland, and his American-born wife, who later recorded the Queen\u0027s advice on how to get through arduous tours like these.\u0027One plants one\u0027s feet like this,\u0027 the Queen told her. \u0027Always keep them parallel. Make sure your weight is evenly distributed. That\u0027s all there is to it.\u0027The advice would be invaluable, with a punishing itinerary in 100f (38c) heat. The centrepiece was a White House state banquet for more than 200 guests, including Hollywood stars Cary Grant, Telly Savalas and Merle Oberon.There was some amusement when the after-dinner cabaret, pop duo Captain \u0026amp Tennille, launched into their moderately risque hit Muskrat Love. That turned to considerable unamusement when President Ford invited the Queen to dance. The band chose that very moment to strike up a new tune: The Lady Is A Tramp.There was an even more awkward moment when Ford\u0027s successor arrived at Buckingham Palace a year later. Perhaps overcome with nerves on what was his first journey outside the U.S., Jimmy Carter became a little over-familiar with a senior member of the Royal Family.As William Shawcross notes in her official biography, the Queen Mother hated being told that she reminded people of their own mothers. Having informed her that she did, indeed, remind him of his own mother — \u0027Miz Lillian\u0027 — President Carter kissed the Queen Mother on the lips. As she later remarked, no one had done that since the death of George VI. \u0027I took a sharp step backwards,\u0027 she recalled, \u0027not far enough.\u0027Carter\u0027s successor, however, would enjoy one of the more enduring friendships between the Queen and any foreign politician. It certainly helped that Ronald Reagan was an accomplished horseman. When he came to Windsor Castle for a semi-private stay in 1982, the two heads of state spent a good hour riding all over Windsor Great Park followed by teams of bodyguards — on both four legs and four wheels.On a return trip to the U.S. in 1983, the Queen fulfilled a lifetime\u0027s ambition of touring the West Coast. In Hollywood, Reagan laid on a star-packed lunch for 500. The entertainment included Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope and Perry Como, but the arrangements left some of the local talent rather peeved.\u0027Ronald Reagan was asked who should be at the top table,\u0027 recalls Sir Brian Fall, then private secretary to the British Foreign Secretary, Francis Pym. \u0027Should it be actor friends or political friends? He couldn\u0027t sort it out so he said: \u0027Why don\u0027t we pack it out with Brits in Hollywood?\u0027 \u0027The result was a top table full of British-born stars such as Julie Andrews and Dudley Moore. For some status-obsessed Hollywood egos, it was all too much. The Palace press office, which had played no part in the planning, was left fending off accusations that the Queen was only interested in sitting with fellow Brits.          Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh this afternoon arrived in Washington D.C. where they were greeted by President Eisenhower\u0027I was on the table next door with Julie Andrews\u0027s husband,\u0027 Sir Brian recalls. \u0027He was so ticked off at not being on the right table that he walked off and left a gap.\u0027A few days later the Queen was due to arrive in San Francisco on Britannia, but foul weather persuaded her to fly instead. The Reagans put Air Force Two at her disposal and staff recall a very excited Queen pressing her face against a plane window to enjoy an aerial view of the Golden Gate Bridge.With no Royal Yacht to stay on, the combined power of the White House, the Palace and the personal contacts of the former state governor found the Queen and the Duke last-minute accommodation in the Presidential Suite at the St Francis Hotel, where Nancy Reagan even arranged for works of art from local museums to be rounded up and hung on the walls.\u0027The next question was: where to go for dinner?\u0027 remembers Sir Brian. Again the White House came to the rescue and managed to empty San Francisco\u0027s most famous restaurant, Trader Vic\u0027s, for the night. For the Queen, who had not eaten in a restaurant for 15 years, it was a novel experience, right down to being given a fortune cookie at the end (she read the message and then put it in her handbag).The \u0027special relationship\u0027 was still in robust shape following the first Gulf War as the Queen and Prince Philip arrived to stay with President George H. W. Bush in 1991.However, the state visit got off to an inauspicious start following President Bush\u0027s formal welcome on the White House lawn. After his speech, he was supposed to press a pedal which raised the platform from which the Queen was then going to speak.‘It’s satire, if you don’t like it you don’t have to read...Brits with less than six months on their passport could face...Share this article He forgot to do it and the Queen, being rather shorter, remained invisible to much of the crowd.The moment was encapsulated in the words of NBC\u0027s Jim Miklaszewski: \u0027She\u0027s gone! All I got is a talking hat!\u0027 To this day, Palace officials and diplomats still refer to the state visit as \u0027the talking hat tour\u0027.D uring her stay in Washington, the Queen had her first encounter with the President\u0027s son, George W. Bush, then in charge of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He had been forewarned by his mother not to talk to the Queen, as he could be \u0027mercurial\u0027.The Queen was rather intrigued, particularly since he was wearing cowboy boots etched with the words \u0027God Save The Queen\u0027. At one point she asked him if he was the black sheep of the family.\u0027I guess so,\u0027 replied Bush Junior.\u0027All families have them,\u0027 observed the Queen.\u0027Who\u0027s yours?\u0027 Bush Junior replied, at which point the First Lady, Barbara Bush, intervened with a cry of: \u0027Don\u0027t answer that!\u0027Relations between London and Washington cooled to a more business-like level during the Clinton years, partly because of heated disagreements over the Western response to war in Bosnia.There was no state visit in either direction in that sort of climate, but the Queen fulfilled her now-familiar role as keeper of the \u0027special relationship\u0027.The Clintons might not have had the full royal treatment at Windsor or Buckingham Palace but, in 1994, they were the Queen\u0027s guests for the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of D-Day.Only the Clintons were invited to stay aboard Britannia in Portsmouth ahead of the voyage to France the next day, accompanied by the leaders of all the allied nations and ocean liners packed with veterans.          Queen Elizabeth II stands with US President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, in the Grand Corridor during their visit to Windsor Castle in Berkshire    Andrew Parker Bowles in his army daysSpring 1980, a year before his marriage to Lady Diana Spencer, and the Prince of Wales was on his way to Rhodesia for the hand-over ceremony which would herald its rebirth as independent Zimbabwe.Arrangements for the royal visit had been made by one Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Parker Bowles and he had invited out his wife Camilla who, as the newspapers wasted no time in pointing out, was the Prince\u0027s former girlfriend.\u0027Charles\u0027s old flame lights up darkest Zimbabwe,\u0027 the Daily Mail\u0027s Nigel Dempster reported. However, it was Andrew Parker Bowles whom the Prince should have been most grateful to see.The 40-year-old Army officer had taken it upon himself to double-check every section of the royal itinerary.This included a trip to the Henderson Veterinary Research Station at Mazowe, where the vets were so convinced that they had found a way to tame the notoriously irascible African buffalo, a creature responsible for at least 200 deaths each year, that they were going to invite the Prince to ride one.          Mr Parker Bowles, earlier this monthFortunately for Prince Charles, the gallant Lieutenant Colonel decided to test-ride a buffalo himself, only to be thrown off and gored through the right thigh. A few inches further up and he would have been killed. The royal riding trip at Mazowe was now off. Had the Prince followed the Foreign Office plan, though, he would have been in grave danger. \u0027I always remind him that if it hadn\u0027t gored me and had gored him, things might be very different these days,\u0027 laughs Brigadier Parker Bowles.\u0027He gives me a wry smile and, rightly, takes it quite lightly.\u0027                                                    Adapted from Queen Of The World by Robert Hardman (Century, £25). © Robert Hardman 2018.

According to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation, the women, in their late teens or early 20s, met De La Hoya on a dating website in February and began messaging with him on Snapchat. The multi-millionaire former boxing champion and Golden Boy Promotions chairman then invited the women back to his luxury condominium in downtown Pasadena, California. The property inside The Montana building, which De La Hoya snapped up in 2017 for $2.65 million, boasts 4,150 square feet of luxurious interior space, three bedrooms, a patio and a wine cellar. Once there, it\u0027s claimed the women partied with the star before filming him on a cell phone in various \u0027embarrassing\u0027 sexual situations. De La Hoya was apparently intoxicated but aware he was being filmed. DailyMail.com has learned that weeks later the women contacted De La Hoya and allegedly demanded $2million to prevent the tape being released. It\u0027s understood the former boxer refused to pay or even negotiate so the pair then approached celebrity sex tape broker Kevin Blatt with the video.           The timing of the headline-grabbing announcement is fortuitous as La Hoya promotes the fight between Gennady Golovkin and Saul \u0027Canelo\u0027 Alvarez on September 15.

In April this year, the boxing legend found himself at the center of an alleged $2million extortion plot           Boxing legend Oscar De La Hoya, 45, is at the center of a $2M extortion plot after two women filmed him taking part in \u0027embarrassing\u0027 sexual acts in his home The content of the \u0027shocking\u0027 sex tape allegedly includes a totally naked De La Hoya playing the part of exhibitionist in front of two women, one blonde and one brunette, while in one scene the women are seen performing sex acts on him with kitchen utensils.   Realizing the women may be trying to extort De La Hoya, Blatt claims he turned them down. As a last ditch attempt the women also approached De La Hoya\u0027s ex-wife, actress and model Shanna Moakler. DailyMail.com understands Moakler, 43, was told the tape would humiliate her and Atiana, the 19-year-old daughter she has with De La Hoya. And again the women allegedly demanded $2million. Moakler immediately contacted De La Hoya and they both decided to inform the authorities of the alleged extortion plot. It\u0027s understood the case has now been referred to the FBI, which is investigating. A spokesperson for the FBI told DailyMail.com: \u0027We cannot confirm and or deny the existence of an investigation.\u0027 However, Hollywood sex tape broker Blatt, said: \u0027Yes two women tried to extort Oscar De La Hoya. I was contacted by someone claiming to be an Instagram model and she put me in touch with another girl. \u0027I took a meeting, I met the girl in Hollywood at a Coffee Bean, she was young and very skittish, she wore a hoodie and big glasses and tried very hard to disguise herself, she gave me a fake name of Jessica. De La Hoya\u0027s ex, actress and model Shanna Moakler (pictured in 1999) was also dragged into the investigation after the woman threatened to embarrass her and her daughter by releasing the tape  The boxing champ shares a daughter with Moakler, Atiana, 19 (pictured)           He is currently married to Puerto Rican singer Millie Corretjer (pictured in 2006) \u0027Jessica then showed me over an hour of clips from a sex tape that purportedly showed Oscar De La Hoya. She said she and her friend had already approached Oscar and demanded $2million. \u0027I\u0027ve seen a lot of shocking videos in my time and this one was incredibly embarrassing. But it was clear to me Oscar had been set up. \u0027The girls even took a picture of his driver\u0027s license to prove it was him, they knew what they were doing, almost as if they had done this before. \u0027In my mind it was outright extortion and I cut ties with them immediately.\u0027 Blatt said he has reached out to De La Hoya\u0027s people and is aware that the FBI is involved, adding he\u0027d be willing to assist in any investigation. A source close to Moakler, who asked not to be named, told DailyMail.com that the former Playboy model turned reality star was interviewed by FBI investigators for two hours on Monday. The source said the incident had caused much distress to her and De La Hoya.\u0027It was very intimidating, they said they wanted $2million or they would release the tape everywhere,\u0027 the source said. \u0027But Shanna stood firm and called their bluff, she told them, \u0027go ahead release it, I don\u0027t care.\u0027 \u0027Then she immediately called Oscar and they decided to go to the authorities. It\u0027s in the hands of the FBI now, they have already interviewed Shanna.\u0027           De La Hoya invited the two women to his luxury condo in Pasadena, California where they partied with the boxer and filmed him in \u0027embarrassing\u0027 sexual situations           In one scene, the women are seen performing sex acts on him with kitchen utensils.

Moakler declined to comment. De La Hoya is no stranger to this kind of controversy. In 2007, he was the subject of a photo scandal when snaps showing the champ clad in fishnets, panties and high heels were splashed online. Serbian stripper Milana Dravnel released the photos and claimed De La Hoya had cheated on his wife with her. At the time De La Hoya\u0027s camp claimed it wasn\u0027t him in the photos and that the stripper was \u0027out for money.\u0027 His team even brought in their own \u0027photo expert,\u0027 who said the snaps were a computer-generated forgery.          In 2007, he was the subject of a photo scandal when snaps showing the champ clad in fishnets, panties and high heels were splashed onlineDravnel, who released the photos, later filed a $100million lawsuit against De La Hoya claiming he unleashed a smear campaign against her to stop the photos from emerging. The case was later settled and in 2011 De La Hoya gave a tell-all interview in which he admitted \u0027It was me\u0027 in the photos. \u0027Let me to tell you, yes, yes, it was me,\u0027 he told Spanish TV network Univision.

The gang declined in power by the 1910s and was eventually all but destroyed in 1917 with the death of its leader and arrest of its commanding figures          Mulberry Bend, one of the most dangerous areas controlled by the Five Points gangs pictured in 1896 at the height of gang influence in the area. The original street has now been changed in layout and replaced with Mulberry Street. The area was the original home of several of the most dangerous Irish gangs in the Five Points who lived in cramped tenement buildings surrounding the bustling high street.The images show violent thugs like the Short Tail Gangs who were known to the police as hard drinkers and thieves.Also pictured are an Irish-American group known as the Gopher Gang at the peak of their power and groups of young boys robbing drunk men in New York in the early 1900s.Five Points was a nineteenth century neighbourhood in the area now known as Lower Manhattan in New York City. Sometimes considered the original American melting pot, this run-down Manhattan district became the centre of settlement for the poorest and least fortunate immigrants. Irish, Italian and Eastern European immigrants and freed Black slaves settled in Five Points.Gambling dens and brothels were numerous in the Five Points area, and it was considered a dangerous destination, where many people had been mugged particularly at night and where race riots would regularly break out. In 1842, Charles Dickens famously visited the area and was appalled by the terrible living conditions.At the height of occupation of Five Points, only certain areas of London\u0027s East End vied with it in the western world for population density, disease, child mortality, prostitution and crime.Five Points was a place where life was short and violent and the place where the original gangs of New York were formed.          A gang of young boys demonstrate how they make their living for the camera, by robbing drunk men who have passed out in the middle of the street. Pick-pocketing was one of the main rackets controlled by gangs in the Five Points who would ide up the loot from successful robberies. Alcoholism and poverty went hand-in-hand in the neighborhood which meant crude techniques like the one pictures were devastatingly effective and allowed thieves to easily get away with the crime          A busy street scene outside a hatters shop in the Five Points district of Manhattan in 1880 when gang violence was at an all-time high. Although the neighborhood was shrouded in suspicion and criminal activity there were a number of legitimate businesses which ran alongside the day-to-day organised crime syndicates. Shops like this hatters lined the busy shopping streets which were both a hub for criminals and for local business leaders  A crime scene photo at Bottle Alley, the headquarters of the Irish-American Whyos Gang.

According to local sources in one building known as the \u0027Old Brewery\u0027 there was at least one murder per night at the height of the gang\u0027s power          Members of the Five Points Gang, an Italian American gang founded around 1880, whose later members included the most famous gangster of all time - Al Capone. After becoming a predominantly Irish neighborhood during a wave of immigration in the 1860s, the Five Points found a new Italian influence thrust upon the area with a new wave of arrivals in the 1880s. Some of the new Italian immigrants had connections within the Mafia and were experienced crime bosses back in their old countryOrganized criminal gangs, like the Bowery Boys, the Dead Rabbits, the Short Tails, the Gopher Gang, the Whyos Gang and the Montgomery Guards cropped up across Manhattan.Each group had had their own way of letting people know who they stood with. The Bowery Boys, a gang mainly made up of firefighters, would go out in red shirts and stovepipe hats the Short Tails went out with their shirt untucked and the Irish Dead Rabbits would head out with a rabbit nailed to a stick.Meanwhile the Whyos - an Irish-American criminal group who ranged from pickpockets to murderers - had a distinctive gang\u0027s cry which sounded like a bird or owl calling \u0027Why-oh!\u0027 to let people know they were on the streets.All of the gangs of Five Points competed for control of the revenue made from illicit activities and fights would break out over most anything.The Five Points gangs made their neighborhood one of the deadliest places on earth. It was said that they had the highest murder rate of any slum in the world. According to the legends, the most dangerous building - a housing tenement called the \u0027Old Brewery\u0027 - saw a murder every single night.          The Short Tail Gang, a violent group of thugs and one of the most feared of the Five Points gangs, was reportedly known to the police for being \u0027hard drinkers, highwaymen and thieves\u0027. They were recognisable in the streets around the Five Points because of their distinctive style of dressing. They can be seen here wearing their characteristic short-tailed coats which gave the gang its name          One of four men sharing a single cellar beneath a tenement home, circa 1880.

The Whyos were so called because they made a distinctive call to one another where they shouted \u0027Why-o\u0027 in the street to mark themselves out as gang membersAbove all, it was nationality and race that turned the Five Points gangs against one another. Riots and fights broke out between the staunchly anti-Catholic Bowery Boys and the Irish Dead Rabbits.In one brutal two-day battle, an estimated 1,000 people took to the streets of New York to fight, beating each other senseless and looting one another\u0027s homes. By the time the blood had dried, eight men were dead and up to a hundred more lay injured - an event that inspired Martin Scorsese\u0027s 2002 film Gangs of New York.For a century, these notorious gangs ruled their neighbourhood but by the early 1900s, Five Points was torn down piece by piece. Politicians railed for it to be ripped apart with one telling his constituent, \u0027This hot-bed of infamy, this modern Sodom, is situated in the very heart of your City!\u0027  The crime-riddled Old Brewery was pulled down, missionary houses were brought in, and bit by bit, the face of the city changed.The Five Points gangs were broken up and slowly faded into history. These images remember their notorious legacy.          Four homeless men lay passed out on the steps of a dilapidated home in the Five Points around 1880 when the neighborhood was its most impoverished. Various efforts by different charitable organizations and iniduals, most Christian themed, attempted to ameliorate the suffering of the poor in Five Points. Towards the beginning of the 20th century the area was completely redeveloped and upgraded          Inside of a tenement in Hell\u0027s Kitchen where several women and men are crowded into a small room and forced to wrap up in several layers to protect them from the cold. Disease was rife among the residents in the Five Points. The lack of scientific knowledge, sanitation systems, the numerous overcrowded dwellings, and absence of even rudimentary health care made impoverished areas such as Five Points ideal for the development and spread of these diseases          A cobbler taking a break from making shoes and eating some bread inside of a tenement in Five Points, New York city, circa 1880. Among the criminals, enterprising iniduals were able to flourish and the streets of the neighborhood were awash with craftsmen selling everything from hats to shoes and unique garments. Skilled laborers had come over from Ireland and Italy and were able to peddle their wares in New York as they had done in their old country          An illegal tenement in the neighborhood which crammed in residents for the price of five cents a spot despite the fact there was limited floor space. At the height of occupation of Five Points, only certain areas of London\u0027s East End vied with it in the western world for population density, disease, infant and child mortality, unemployment, prostitution, violent crime, and other classic ills of the urban destitute          Women lodge inside of the local police station during a typhus epidemic in the 1880s.

I chose 10 of them and then set out to find their human counterpart.Fenella and Georgine, a saluki“The plan was to shoot the dogs, find the humans, style them, then have them behave or pose in a similar way. This process would be repeated until we had all the shots. At the same time I would always have one eye on people I passed in the street. Many of the subjects I stopped in the park or on the bus, and had to find a tactful way of saying you look exactly like a poodle, can I take your photograph?Henry and Hope, an Afghan hound“Without exception, people reacted positively.

No wonder Dennis the Menace has already moved inPart cliff face, part galleon, the new V\u0026ampA Dundee stands on the banks of the Tay like a curious craft sailed in from another realm. It is at once primal and futuristic, its great hull-like forms covered in slabs of gnarled concrete that fragment in places as they rise, as if already ruined. From some angles, the twisting mass reveals the gaping mouth of a cave. From others, it is like encountering the ribbed carcass of a beached whale, or the bones of a shipwreck.It is a fitting form, given the rocky ride this £80m project has endured over the last decade, buffeted by multiple storms of cost escalation, construction delays and accusations of gross mismanagement. Originally planned with a budget of £27m, then £45m, and intended to rise out of the churning waters of the Tay, the building has retreated to dry land, and finally been completed at almost double the cost, four years late.“If we want to make something closer to nature than a building, then the costs are always unpredictable,” says Kengo Kuma, the feted Japanese architect responsible for summoning this great geological object from the riverbed. “We encountered many unexpected things along the way.”The history of the project follows a familiar story of an inexperienced client seduced by a thrilling competition image and only worrying about practicalities later. An independent report published in 2015 listed a damning catalogue of failures in procurement, governance, project management and cost control. It concluded that the client body, Design Dundee Ltd (a partnership of the V\u0026ampA, Dundee city council, Scottish Enterprise, the University of Dundee and Abertay University) had little chance of realising the building on budget from the start.But it stands there now, beside a similarly ambitious neighbour in the RRS Discovery, the ship that sailed Scott and Shackleton to Antarctica in the early 1900s. They are a pair of structures alike in their bravery-verging-on-recklessness.Standing as two inverted pyramidal forms that join together as they rise, creating an archway that frames views of the river, Kuma’s building has a magnetic presence, enticing you to explore its chiselled clefts. It may no longer stand entirely in the Tay, but shallow pools of water lap at its base, while one prow plunges straight into the fast-flowing river, ensuring that much of the original intention survives. Bracing east-coast winds whistle through the tunnelled archway, reinforcing the elemental feeling of standing at the edge of the land – and encouraging you to seek swift shelter inside.As you enter through a slanting triangular opening sliced beneath a deep overhang, the rough concrete panels give way to a warm, bright interior lined with layers of wooden flaps, set at odd angles as if caught in a breeze. Fixed with the same jumbled irregularity as the concrete cladding, this rippling panelled lining adds a surreal quality, as if you have just walked into a scaled-up model.“I like to make my buildings out of particles,” says Kuma, who is known for cladding his structures with many small pieces, whether making a screen of tiles suspended in a wire rigging for his Folk Art Museum in Hangzhou, China, or bolting milky glass panels on to the facade of his FRAC art gallery in Marseille. “It avoids the big boring wall, and gives intimacy to a space,” he adds. “And it can teach us about depth, size and shadow. A white abstract box cannot teach us anything.”These might sound like the gnomic pronouncements of a Shinto sage, but Kuma’s best buildings create richly layered spaces that delight in the effects of light filtering through their various parts. The V\u0026ampA Dundee is more bunker-like than his lighter timber concoctions in Japan, and some of the details a bit more clunky, but the effects are there. The building’s angled stony strata catch changing light throughout the day and are illuminated through the reflecting pools by night up close, their rough-cast texture echoes Scottish harling, forming giant cliff faces of pebbledash.The cave-like entrance leads to a gaping interior volume, where a shallow black marble stair climbs around a large open floor taken up by a cafe, shop and ticket desk, while a long wooden bench rings the edge of the room. It is large and open enough to feel like a true public space for the city, influenced by project architect Maurizio Mucciola. “Being Italian, my reference for public space is a nice cosy square, like you get in Venice,” he says, “where you can just sit with a spritz and watch the world go by.”Proceeding up above this generous indoor piazza, you come to the main event: two large gallery spaces, one dedicated to Scottish design, the other a column-free hangar of a room for temporary exhibitions, opening with the Ocean Liners show, which began in London earlier this year but is here given more space to breathe. At 1,100 sq m, equivalent to the V\u0026ampA’s new subterranean extension in London, it is the largest museum-standard exhibition space in Scotland, and it will receive touring shows as well as initiate its own.Designed by museum experts ZMMA, the Scottish Design Galleries are a tour de force, showcasing a dazzling array of 300 objects designed or made in Scotland, from Hunter wellies to the Duchess of Roxburghe’s diamond-winged tiara, and original Dennis the Menace artwork from the Beano, produced by Dundee-based publishers DC Thomson. A sci-fi Paisley cloak from a recent Star Wars film is a suitably futuristic accessory for Kuma’s stone spaceship, while a star of the show is Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s Oak Room from the Ingram Street tearooms, restored and on display for the first time in 50 years.The display provides an illuminating lesson on the vitality and originality of Scottish design throughout the ages, which makes what is happening outside the window even more hard to swallow. While competition images and PR shots show the V\u0026ampA building in splendid isolation, the reality is anything but. The view of the museum from Dundee’s Georgian city centre is already partially blocked by the hulking frame of a new hotel and offset by a garish new railway station, both part of a £1bn waterfront masterplan to “connect the city with the river”. As in many waterside regeneration schemes the world over, from Salford to Cape Town, this means the hasty erection of commercial buildings around the new cultural anchor, built under the banner of “bringing life” to the place. Sadly, it seems that all of the architectural effort has been lavished on the museum, with little care for how the rest of the pieces hang together.Thankfully, Kuma’s concrete culture ship is tough enough to withstand whatever the developers want to throw at it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18da22ce13d09a4179722e07d8753d1d04659fde/0_88_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fe1df5be65df3354e1070b8334bbf7d","title":"tesco launch discount chain aldi lidl jacks","story":"Supermarket to take on Aldi and Lidl with cut-price brand named for founder Jack CohenTesco will unveil its new discount chain Jack’s next week as the UK’s biggest supermarket throws down the gauntlet to the German discounters Aldi and Lidl.The first of the stores, named after the Tesco founder, Jack Cohen, will be unveiled by the supermarket’s chief executive, Dave Lewis, in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, on Wednesday.Tesco has forced staff and suppliers working on the project to sign non-disclosure agreements and the retailer is saying little about its plans. But when the  visited the Chatteris store on Tuesday a Jack’s sign could be seen over the door, albeit covered with a blue tarpaulin, and branding was also clearly visible inside.Mainstream supermarkets have been searching for a way to get into the fast-growing discount market, having seen Aldi and Lidl steal their shoppers since the recession, when rising food prices encouraged Britons to shop around for groceries.Since taking the helm, Lewis has launched the low price “farm” brands to take on the discounters. The brands, with fictitious names like Redmere, Woodside and Willow, are expected to be sold in Jack’s.More recently it has replaced its cheapest “Everyday Value” brand with generic names like Bay Fishmongers, Ms Mollys and Butcher’s Choice, which would also fit the bill.There is also a new Jack’s branded grocery range. In Chatteris it was possible to see Nestlé and Cadbury’s chocolate on the shelves.Shore Capital analyst Clive Black expects the Jack’s chain to encompass 100 stores, including around 60 of its small “” supermarkets, some of which are struggling.“Tesco has a cohort of problem stores where the traditional Tesco offer is a square peg in a round hole,” he explained. “They have got low footfall and low income hinterlands and Aldi and Lidl are taking everyone’s legs away.”During the summer months, Tesco started recruiting staff for a “new store format” in Chatteris. The premises have been empty for four years since Lewis put the brakes on openings when he took charge in 2014.Tesco has 2,659 stores in the UK, a sprawling estate that includes 172 s. It is thought that Tesco s in St Helens and Edge Hill, Liverpool are among those destined to be converted to the Jack’s brand.It is not the first time one of the mainstream supermarket chains has tried to fight back with a discount chain of its own.Sainsbury’s joined forces with the Danish chain Netto in 2014 to launch a UK discounter, but the venture closed its 16 stores two years later after struggling to make a profit. In the mid-noughties Asda experimented with the Asda Essentials chain but gave up after less than a year.Tesco previously tried the discount route in the 1980s with Victor Value , but the move was abandoned after four years because the management team at the time feared it might undermine the main brand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54ff1699e94e330b169a1d8885bbdd3f5a5f33b5/173_78_4185_2511/master/4185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e955e5a04ebfccf4ccd52e82c0f8ef06","title":"london street signs nameplates instagram","story":"Graphic designer Alistair Hall uses Instagram to highlight the city’s significant nameplatesStreet signs tell us not only where we are but also where we’ve been, with their typography and styles stretching back centuries.The graphic designer Alistair Hall is using Instagram to draw attention to them.

We were originally assured by the transport minister, Jo Johnson, that he would look over our proposals before the sale went ahead – something he sadly didn’t stand by.I embarked on my journey to become a baker back in 2010. I lived in Hackney, and it was here that I wanted to be based. I wanted to use local ingredients, trade as part of the local community and source ingredients from farms in the region, which I could visit. I started by using a local restaurant’s wood-fired pizza oven and delivered bread around the local area by bicycle. As my confidence grew I began to look for a permanent home for my business, which I went onto christen the e5 Bakehouse.Finding a commercial manufacturing space proved difficult in E5, but after some searching I found a corner of a railway arch to rent in the neighbouring E8 postcode, near London Fields. Within a year our business had grown to the point we needed more space and we took over another arch further along the same terrace.The warehouse-like space was basic. Plastic shuttering covered the inside walls to channel away the water that seeped through the Victorian brickwork, and it had a concrete floor and metal roller shutters. We applied for a “change of use” to accommodate a small cafe at the front, and made bread in the rest.The community of tenants in neighbouring arches supported us. Our stainless baking tables were made up by a fabricator, our ovens were repaired by the second-hand kitchen dealer, our delivery bicycle was welded by the metal staircase company next door and the oven was fuelled by wood from carpenters. It was the type of community I had hoped to be part of – where I knew the other business owners on the street and we could trade with one another.Network Rail have been fairly apathetic landlords. The arch is a shell that receives no maintenance or care, and tenants are responsible for the upkeep. You might ask why we should even oppose the sale.Primarily, in my view, because they are a wonderful asset. Renting them out provides a sustained income for Network Rail, which they can use to support our rail infrastructure. I cannot understand why, if they are to be sold, it’s big business that should benefit. Why not offer that chance to community organisations, local councils or a conglomeration of the small businesses that currently occupy the arches?Together with other railway arch businesses, we have formed a campaign group, s of the Arches, not only to oppose the sell-off but also to try to ensure a sustainable future for our railway arch economy, regardless of who owns the them. It’s vital to make sure that any further rent increases are sustainable and the existing businesses in the arches – especially those ones that have been there for decades – have the chance to keep trading.• Ben Mackinnon is the founder of e5 Bakehouse"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da34a819ccc13d11f138c36b76510277d531a76c/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b06d57d7603dd97011664b45542ecbe3","title":"huge roof bar royal festival hall condemned shocking","story":"Exclusive: plans would harm London building regarded as one of Britain’s finest, say activistsA secret plan to install an enormous bar and restaurant on the roof of the Royal Festival Hall has been condemned as shocking, insensitive and harmful for a building regarded as one of the finest examples of 20th century British architecture. can reveal that the Southbank Centre and a commercial partner, the Incipio Group, have applied for permission to erect a temporary, transparent pavilion on the flat roof. Covering 686 sq metres of floor space, it would be open until 2am at weekends and offer diners and drinkers spectacular views of the Thames.The idea is that the Pergola on the River, as it would be called, would be in place for three years. It would then be removed and the arts centre would go ahead with a long-held ambition to use the roof for open-air performances.But the Twentieth Century Society conservation group said it was shocked by the proposals and would be objecting in the strongest terms.Grace Etherington, the society’s caseworker, said the plans would obscure the distinctive signage of the grade I-listed building as well as the curved roof behind it. “It is a landmark building and the riverside frontage is fundamental to its significance,” she said. “This is not the right location for an off-the -peg design.”She said the hall and surrounding buildings “represent the best of 20th-century architecture in this country and they should be cherished rather than treated in such a shocking and insensitive way”.Historic England has also recommended refusal “because of the serious and unjustified harm” it would cause to the Royal Festival Hall.But the centre says it cannot carry out much needed upgrades to the hall, or its implement plan for rooftop performances, without the money from a commercial restaurant and bar.The application says there are “considerable maintenance and capital works costs” for the hall. Required works include roof repairs, waterproofing, redecoration and security improvements, with the last refurbishment taking place in 2007.“Despite this challenging financial environment, the government continues to encourage Southbank Centre to be innovative and entrepreneurial in developing a erse funding base,” the application says.Incipio specialises in creating pop-up venues in interesting and temporarily vacant spaces. Other locations it has been involved with include on top of a vacant platform at Paddington station.Its plan for the Royal Festival Hall would involve “a relatively small, lightweight structure” that would be 4.9 metres high and extend along the north facade of the hall. It would have a maximum capacity of 220 people. The proposed opening hours are 11am-1am Sunday to Wednesday and 11am-2am Thursday to Saturday.The hall’s familiar lettering would be replicated on the front of the temporary structure.Discussions with Lambeth council first began in March and have involved Historic England.The Twentieth Century Society said it was consulted at the pre-application stage but despite strong objections, “the scheme has only undergone minimal revision”.After the three years as a restaurant and bar, it would become an open-air venue for performances including dance, cabaret and comedy. Because of the weather it anticipates being open from April to November, hosting 30 to 40 performances a year.The application says the Pergola would be “an enabling development” to help pay for improvements to the Royal Festival Hall and “help to realise the exciting new arts and cultural programming space.”The hall was designed by London county council’s architectural team, led by Leslie Martin, and opened in 1951, the focal point of the Festival of Britain.It is not the first time the centre has been involved in a planning row. In 2013 it proposed a £100m glass pavilion that would have floated above the grey bulk of the centre. It would have meant moving the skateboard park on the riverfront in order to build more shops and restaurants.Among the successful objectors were the then National Theatre director, Nicholas Hytner, who argued it would cause “irreparable harm”, and the then London mayor, Boris Johnson, who supported the skateboarders.The Southbank Centre has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f6f91b749c8d6b062786e3fb985288e5ea6f8f3/19_0_5172_3102/master/5172.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0acf1a7e6e0d6c2fd72836a62a1a5c8","title":"eu climate law could cause catastrophic deforestation","story":"World’s carbon sinks are at risk because the law will count energy from burning trees as carbon neutral, say climate scientists Senior climate scientists say that the world’s carbon sinks could be facing a grave threat from a wholly unexpected source: the EU’s renewable energy directive.The climate law could suck in as much imported wood as Europe harvests each year because it will count energy created from the burning of whole trees as “carbon neutral”, according to several academics including a former vice-chair of the UN IPCC.Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, who is now a climate sciences professor at Université Catholique de Louvain, said the risk of the directive encouraging tree clearances and the destruction of global carbon sinks was now “extremely high”.“This amounts to sawing off the branch on which humanity sits,” he told the .Indonesia and Brazil were among 27 countries which pledged “to increase the use of wood … to generate energy as part of efforts to counter climate change” at the Bonn climate summit last year.Without additional conservation measures, “the directive in its present form will create a large demand for wood that will contribute to destroying those forests,” van Ypersele said. “It is a catastrophe in the making.”The EU’s thinking has been that carbon neutrality can be achieved by planting new saplings that eventually compensate for the carbon released by the burning of trees for energy.But the saplings’ growth can takes decades or centuries. By 2050, replacing fossil fuels with wood will likely result in two- to three times more carbon in the atmosphere per gigajoule of final energy, the paper says.Nino Aveni, a spokesman for the Bioenergy Europe trade association, argued that new saplings could reabsorb the CO2 emitted by fully grown burned trees within “years to decades”.“Sustainability criteria are a guarantee that existing forest protection measures are applied to wood used for bioenergy production,” he said. “EU member states have already strong forest policies in place.”An EU official confirmed that the new analysis was accurate – and said that if anything, it underestimated the scale of the problem.The magnitude of the problem – which eminent academics last year described as “a critical flaw” in EU climate policy – was not understood within the EU, the source claimed.“Partly that is because of wishful thinking,” the official said. “Partly it is so fundamentally wrong that most people would not believe it could be as wrong as it is.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6ddbe79b433492c727dc8c3b05537fe9307a334/0_0_3543_2362/master/3543.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fa4fc5cdc890839ab8bfb36f228e6c57 1400w","title":"how to fit in at london fashion week a beginners guide","story":"For first timers, it’s all about how you define yourself – are you an alpha, a beta or a gamma?London fashion week starts on Friday and I am going for the first time. I imagine it’s full of glamorous and fabulous people, so I am worried about fitting in. What should I do? Cara, by emailOh young neophyte, innocent little babe wandering into the dark wood! I read your letter and I see the words, but the sound in my head is that of Ariel the little mermaid, splashing about happily and carefree in the sea, but singing about how she wants to be where the people are, wants to see them dancing, walking around on those – what do you call them? Feeeeeeeet! (Note: you do not walk around on your feet at fashion week – you walk around on the newly re-issued Prada neon wedge sandals with patent leather flames coming off the back. Also, I realise that the Little Mermaid analogy makes me Ursula the sea witch and I’m OK with that. I’m just here to help you, you poor, unfortunate souls!)The first thing to stress is that fashion week is a very serious business event. It’s not just about champagne, OK? Fashion is a billion-dollar industry! Jobs! People! And clothes – everyone wears ’em! And anyone asking if perhaps there’s a better way to run this industry than making the world’s fashion press schlep to four random cities twice a year, take taxis all around those cities to even more random locations to see wildly expensive clothes, the majority of which will never be worn by anyone, with the front rows filled with celebrities, rather than the journalists, well, you just don’t get it, my friend. It’s all about creating an image of aspiration, yes? And aspiration sells clothes, and that leads to jobs and and and …Oh, forget it. Does anyone want to read another justification of fashion weeks? I would rather hand-wash my cerulean blue jumper. Let’s focus on your question, Cara: how to get through it. Now, it all depends on whether you want to be an alpha, a beta or a gamma. A gamma is someone who is happy to stay as anonymous and invisible as possible, and bravo to them – sitting quietly on the sidelines is underestimated, now that everyone wants to be the star of the show. You enjoy yourselves, gammas.The alphas and betas have different priorities. Sure, they are there to look at the clothes on the runway, but they are really there for people to look at THEM. They pick out three outfits every day – and another for the evening (they are not FARMERS, as 30 Rock’s Jack Donaghy would say) – and their entire sense of self hangs on whether a 19-year-old blogger photographs them for their streetstyle Tumblr and what seat a harassed PR put them in for the show.And yet the alpha and the beta are very different beasts. The beta cares and shows everyone they care the alpha cares, but pretends they do not. So, if the beta is photographed by streetstyle bloggers on her way into a fashion show, she will frantically hunt down that photo online and put it all over her social media (total beta move). The alpha, by contrast, will treat the style bloggers as pesky irritations, her eyes heavy with patient irritation as she explains to the panting masses whether her jumpsuit is from Chloé or Céline. Should anyone tell her later that her photo made it on to the front page of a popular fashion website, she will feign interest before turning away and pointedly not Googling said website.Then there’s the seating. By now, everyone (even the gammas – even the omegas!) knows that the row you are in is a reflection of how important you are considered to be. So, a beta will go through all of their invitations as soon as they arrive if they are anywhere other than the first row, they will have their assistant call up and scream at the PR. An alpha will not take their invitation out of its envelope until they arrive at the show venue. They will then simply take their seat in the fourth row and effect an air of such otherworldly indifference that it will be communicated telepathically to the nearest PR, who will rush over and put the alpha in the front row. All the while, the alpha will insist they really aren’t bothered. At this point, the beta will be booted out of their precious seat and moved to the dreaded second row to make room for the alpha, thus occasioning the mother of all beta meltdowns, which the alpha will ignore by gazing serenely at the runway.So all you need to do for fashion week, Cara, is to decide whether you are an alpha, a beta or a gamma. Good luck, my child."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12a584fc1f33f1fae893f561f7d1d28482af33a3/521_73_3574_2146/master/3574.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7e5e49cd9de508f0532063f131d44fc","title":"fenella fielding peter bradshaw appreciation","story":"She became synonymous with her slinky vamp in Carry on Screaming, but Fenella Fielding was a richly intelligent stage performer who came within a whisker of being Fellini’s museSome time in the late 1960s, Federico Fellini is said to have taken the beautiful young Fenella Fielding out to dinner at Claridge’s in London and offered her a movie that he would direct, featuring her in half a dozen roles: a sensational showcase. But Fielding turned him down, on the grounds that she was booked for a theatrical season at Chichester. It may not have happened quite that way – Fielding had a mischievous way of exaggerating anecdotes for the benefit of saucer-eyed interviewers. But however serious or merely seductive Fellini’s movie idea (did he expansively improvise it over brandies?), the great director was undoubtedly impressed with Fielding’s acting talent. She was a brilliant interpreter of Wilde and Ibsen on stage and had written and performed one-woman revue shows at the time of the Peter Cook satire boom. Perhaps Fellini was also a little in love with her.What would have happened if Fielding had somehow broken her Chichester contract and done the Fellini film? Perhaps her career and public reputation would have gone another way, and she would have achieved a position in film to match the very real respect she had earned in the theatre.As things turned out, she was destined to be remembered for just one thing, and she good-humouredly accepted that: a sexy-campy-vampy cartoon persona. This was most obviously her slinky Valeria in Carry on Screaming (1966), in which she reclines languorously on a chaise-longue, asks Harry H Corbett’s uptight-but-tempted police inspector: “Do you mind if I smoke?” and starts to emit vapour from her whole body. “And I was trying to give up!” says Corbett, reaching eagerly into the fog. That deathless line became the title of her autobiography. Everyone agreed that Fenella Fielding was smoking hot.Many talented actors have their careers derailed by one distinctive thing about them, which goes from meal ticket to millstone. Fielding became the victim-beneficiary of that extraordinary voice: outrageously, hilariously velvety and kittenish. In her early movie career, doing light comedies such as the Doctor movies and a farce with Norman Wisdom (whom she detested), she just sounded posh, husky and sexy. If things had been different, she could have had Joanna Lumley’s career. But everyone could see how well the voice played on screen. Fielding prudently declined to do any more Carry Ons after that, seeing all too clearly how she would be imprisoned. But it defined her.In her film career, she was arguably the equivalent of Kenneth Williams, who played her brother in Carry on Screaming: the absurd undead scientist Dr Orlando Watt. He, too, was a very intelligent stage performer, great raconteur and chatshow turn with a richly resonant voice that he allowed to become a self-parody he was tempted into the cul-de-sac of popular British cinema at a time when that appeared to offer regular work and the easy hit of popular fame. But it was a Faustian bargain. As for Fielding, she continued to work in television and the theatre, including some stints with Morecambe and Wise (unlike Gerald Thomas’s stingy Carry On film deals, TV work with Eric and Ernie would have earned her handsome payments for their endless repeats). She became something like a national treasure, and her theatre work is a cherished memory. It would have been interesting if someone had offered her a decent film role."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e22ffa1e8a369fafa0369b9801e5231b3e89a4d0/1260_225_5033_3019/master/5033.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=286290798a9523a8f6e0acd69bd1e3c9","title":"viola davis regrets her role in the help","story":"Actor has said she felt the voices of the black maids in Oscar-nominated 2011 film were marginalisedViola Davis has expressed regret about her role in 2011 film The Help, apparently concurring with critics of its “white saviour” narrative. Davis played Aibileen Clark, one of two black maids in 1963 Mississippi whose stories are told by a young white woman (Emma Stone) in a book exposing the everyday racism they face.In an interview with the New York Times, Davis cited The Help as a role she regretted. “I just felt that at the end of the day that it wasn’t the voices of the maids that were heard,” she said. “I know Aibileen. I know Minny. They’re my grandma. They’re my mom. And I know that if you do a movie where the whole premise is, I want to know what it feels like to work for white people and to bring up children in 1963, I want to hear how you really feel about it. I never heard that in the course of the movie.”Davis qualified her criticism by saying that the experience of making the film in terms of friendships and collaborators was extremely positive.In the same interview, Davis spoke of the “responsibility of feeling like I am the great black female hope for women of colour”, describing it as “a real professional challenge”.“Being that role model and picking up that baton when you’re struggling in your own life has been difficult. Looking at the deficit and seeing that once you’re on top, you can either take the role of leadership or you can toss it in the garbage and say, ‘I’m just out to save myself.’ I choose to be the leader.”The Help, directed by Tate Taylor, earned much praise for its cast, and some censure for its plot. Reviewing for the , Xan Brooks described its moral universe as “rendered in bright cartoonish strokes”. He continued: “The Help is a broad southern melodrama that implicitly frames the push for racial equality as the tale of oppressed African-Americans who are given their voice by a lone white do-gooder.”Davis, who has won a Tony, an Emmy and an Oscar (for Fences), has been a passionate campaigner for both gender and race pay parity.Speaking earlier this year, she called out what she suggested was implicit prejudice in the entertainment industry.“I have a career that’s probably comparable to Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, Sigourney Weaver,” she told Tina Brown. “They had the same path as me, and yet I am nowhere near them. Not as far as money, not as far as job opportunities, nowhere close to it.“People say, ‘You’re a black Meryl Streep … We love you. There is no one like you’,” she explained. “OK, then if there’s no one like me, you think I’m that, you pay me what I’m worth.”Davis is currently picking up rave reviews for her role in Steve McQueen’s forthcoming film, Widows.

Try to source a well-fatted shoulder from a farm shop or good butcher – or take a tip from William Leigh of Mexican street food joint Killa Dilla, and add 500g pork belly and 500g pig cheek to 1kg of pork shoulder.Cut the meat into chunks about 5cm all round – you don’t need to get the ruler out, but if you cut them too small, they’ll break down into mush too large, and they’ll take ages to cook. Leave the skin on: it adds a deliciously gelatinous richness to the final dish, even if you don’t ultimately want to eat it (more fool you).Arrange the chunks in a wide, heavy-based pan big enough to hold them in one layer, and preferably a not-too-crowded one. Add the salt and just enough cold water to cover the meat. You can leave it at that, and many recipes do, but I also favour orange juice for sweetness, and the savoury flavour of bay.Other things cooks add at this point: a cinnamon stick, two or three cloves, a good pinch of cumin, a splash of lager, full-sugar cola, onion wedges, a few smashed garlic cloves, coriander stalks, split jalapeño peppers, a dash of dried oregano – all of which are no doubt delicious, but I don’t think the dish needs them. Trust me: the pork is delicious on its own.Bring the pan to a boil, then turn down the heat and leave it to simmer gently, until the pork is tender but not falling apart, and the water has all but evaporated: turn the chunks occasionally during this time, so they cook evenly. How long this takes depends on your pork, but expect one and-a-half to two and-a-half hours.Increase the heat slightly to encourage any large chunks of fat to render, then, once there’s a generous amount in the pan, turn the heat up to medium-high and fry the meat in its own lard, turning regularly, until golden and crisp in places. Be careful not to break it up too much in the process. Once the fat is rendered, you can refrigerate it, lard and all, and then reheat in a very hot pan)Salsa is the traditional accompaniment for carnitas. What you put in yours is up to you, but for a simple tomato salsa, finely chop three spring onions and two deseeded green jalapeño peppers, and mix with 500g roughly diced, ripe tomatoes and the juice of a lime. Stir in a fistful of chopped coriander and season to taste.Serve the carnitas topped with the salsa and wrapped in warm tortillas – just dry fry them for a minute or two on each side in a frying pan, or gently heat them through in the oven. Strictly speaking, carnitas need nothing else for perfection, but you might like to make a quick salad of finely sliced red cabbage and grated carrot, mixed with plenty of lime juice, salt, and coriander or mint leaves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd036ca1d135a6e78bf04ac3ca9fbf7f8e0688f2/0_161_3870_2322/master/3870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe75f79742b495a894acb260dcd248e7","title":"england switzerland five things we learned","story":"Gareth Southgate can enjoy the winning feeling, Jack Butland needs to sharpen up but Danny Rose is in fine fettleA win is a win is a win, especially after three straight defeats. Understrength England were not discouraged by their scruffy first period and improved sufficiently to scrounge a victory and keep a clean sheet against a team that scored six goals in their last outing. And Marcus Rashford produced a crisp finish to plunder his second goal in two starts. Those facts can only improve morale and make for better reading in the history books.When the Football Association’s Twitter account revealed the lineups, Jordan Pickford seemed to have been attributed the power of bilocation, as he was listed both as a starter and a substitute. The mistake was quickly rectified but the actual starter, Jack Butland, also got off to a goofy start, tapping the ball into the path of Mario Gavranovic early on. Maybe he was nervous knowing that his distribution would be examined especially closely given that it is one of the reasons why Gareth Southgate prefers Pickford and maybe the Stoke man’s confidence has suffered from a start to the season in which he has conceded 11 goals in six league matches, following on from a season in which his team conceded the joint-highest number in the Premier League. Whatever, the shaky start did not enhance Butland’s claim for his country’s No 1 jersey. But at least he did not hide and continued trying to show his ability with his feet. In the 74th minute he made a good sortie from his box to sweep up as Albian Ajeti threatened to collect a pass over the top of England’s defence.With his first touch of the match Danny Rose donked the ball straight out of play as Fabian Delph looked on in bewilderment. But the Tottenham player explained his intentions and three minutes later, in a similar position, Rose exchanged a nifty one-two with Delph before racing down the wing and delivering a dangerous cross. From then he stood out as England’s most useful attacker from open play, so his performance was an excellent reaction to Luke Shaw’s good game against Spain. England have strong options at left wing-back and, although the Leicester crowd hollered their approval when Ben Chilwell was introduced, the youngster has a lot to do to get ahead of Rose and Shaw.The Tottenham player wore the armband on the occasion of his 35th cap but he convinced neither as a captain nor as a midfielder, especially in the first half. As the anchor of a central midfield trio in which the other two members, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Delph, were making their first starts of the season, Dier might have been expected to take the initiative and help his team adapt to the fact that Switzerland regularly outnumbered them in midfield because of Xherdan Shaqiri’s canny movement. But Dier did not get to grips with that in a first period in which he was bypassed, serving neither as an effective sentinel in front of the defence nor as a useful conduit of attacks. He improved in the second half – by being more dynamic and vocal, for starters – but he still looks too limited a player to have a long-term future in the England squad unless he adds a lot more to his game.Three of England’s starters at Leicester – Delph, Loftus-Cheek and Danny Welbeck – had not started a match for their clubs this season and it showed. None of them played particularly badly but nor did they do themselves justice. Their attitudes were commendable and their intentions always noble but they did not quite have the sharpness to make the impact that they hinted at. It is not right that a player as talented and young as Loftus-Cheek should look rusty when given opportunities like this. He will not keep getting them if he is not in a state to take them. If he does not start to play more regularly for Chelsea, he needs to move."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66d4d6d8bf64c02cbe442ade04eef5bd7cad034a/138_348_5369_3222/master/5369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43785032ac4c526558c64f879f2633bd","title":"grimsby manager michael jolley twin towers new york 911","story":"Jolley was a corporate bond trader in New York when the World Trade Center was attacked and knew people who died in the 911 atrocityFrom Manhattan to the Mariners Michael Jolley’s backstory trumps those of most managers. Six months on from taking charge of Grimsby he is explaining how reading economics at Cambridge University paved the way for him to work as a corporate bond trader for six years, for HSBC and Toronto Dominion, in London and then New York. Coaching in League Two is a world away from Midtown’s bright lights and rows of dizzying skyscrapers.One day at his office, near the Empire State Building, however, was like no other: Tuesday, 11 September 2001. Jolley is quick to stress he was a couple of miles away from the terrorist attacks but the horrific events of that morning are something he will always remember.“I saw the second tower fall, so that’s something that stays with you,” he says. “The first awareness was when the first plane hit the World Trade Center north tower. We were trying to find out what was going on and also trying to communicate with people that we knew worked in that building.“Once the second plane struck we were much more aware of the developing situation. There was a lot of confusion after the first plane but much less after the second.“Once events started to unfold, the fight or flight thing starts to kick in. You start to think I’m a risk here, potentially. I walked north to try and get as far away as I possibly could. I got home to my apartment, locked the door and I could hear the F15 fighter jets circling above our heads.”Jolley watched television for much of the next 24 hours, trying to get to grips with what had happened, before returning to work on the Thursday. “In that industry everybody knew several people that had passed away so it was a case of consoling and trying to give as much love and support to the people who needed it.“There was one lad that I had become quite friendly with. I’d been in New York for just over a year and we got on quite well, we’d been out for dinner and he helped me settle. I was a trader and he was a broker, so I had spoken to him many times that morning. He was the main focus of my thoughts throughout and, sadly, he was lost.”Listening to Jolley speak is sobering and he says such events provide perspective if he is ever having a bad day. Bonds were traded with millions and millions at stake, so there was naturally a pressure. “A bit like sport, you would go on streaks of good times and bad times,” he says. “You are trying to manage that risk appropriately and sensibly, that’s really the job of a trader you’re a risk manager. You are always weighing up risk on the basis of the risk and reward, so you have to keep a level head about the numbers because sometimes they are telephone numbers involved.”Jolley laughs at comparisons with the Wolf of Wall Street and says that, while working in the financial industry in New York was bucket-list stuff, he did not find the banking landscape totally fulfilling and returned to football, coaching at Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest, before working with Scotland Universities, when his team were beaten 1-0 by England Universities, managed by Graham Potter.It was Potter that Jolley – who counts Sean Dyche as his mentor having worked alongside him more recently as Burnley’s under-23s coach – leaned on before taking his first management job at AFC Eskilstuna in Sweden, where the former, now at Swansea, worked wonders with Östersund.“When I got the job offer, he was the first person I called and he gave some good, balanced advice on the club. We spoke fairly regularly when I was over there as well. I don’t think I’d be sat here as the Grimsby manager, had I not had that experience in Sweden.“The team started the season really badly they got four points from 12 matches in a 30-game season. It was an uphill battle to survive. I went in with my eyes open that it was going to be a big, big challenge. We had notable victories against Gothenburg and Malmo but in the end we were not able to keep the team up.”Jolley is no longer trading and the only numbers that concern him these days are staring back at him in the league table. Grimsby, who host Oldham on Saturday, have won one of their first seven matches but he is adamant they will stick to the plan. When he replaced Russell Slade in March, the club statement referred to him as a “move away from the classic managerial merry-go-round” given his CV. Does Jolley agree? “It’s difficult for me to pass judgment on what kind of appointment I am. That’s for other people to say. History will decide how successful this is for Grimsby and for me. Both parties are working hard to try and make it a success and that’s all we can do.”• The man who replaced Jolley as Under-23s coach at Burnley, Michael Duff, has taken his first management job at Cheltenham, where he played for eight years. “I was settled, working at a Premier League club, but I feel that the time is right now,” the 40-year-old said.• A doff of the cap to Newport County and Mike Flynn, who has won 28 of his 65 league games as manager since taking over in March 2017. The Exiles had won 28 of their previous 113 league games before that. Tyreeq Bakinson, on loan from Bristol City, has been influential in their good start, with Newport off the summit on goal difference alone.• Leeds United have hardly had to use Patrick Bamford but how will they cope without him for the next four months? Marcelo Bielsa has largely used the 25-year-old off the bench owing to Kemar Roofe’s form but a knee injury, sustained in an under-23s match, will sideline him. Tyler Roberts, capped by Wales last week, is among the striking options.• Will things get worse before they get better at Oxford United? They have little to show for a busy summer when they recruited more than 10 players, including Jamie Mackie and Ricky Holmes. Second-bottom of League One, they have four points from 21 and play Manchester City in the EFL Cup in a couple of weeks, though Wycombe and Walsall are next up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c26f18d73bb449320404d87fa814c129ca4e3ac5/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5d0dd6316e9f5e102bc56c81b029025","title":"hugo lloris drink drive twice limit","story":"• Fined £50,000 and banned from driving for 20 months• Police discovered vomit in Lloris’ Porsche PanameraTottenham Hotspur’s World Cup-winning goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has admitted being more than twice the drink-drive limit when he was stopped in the early hours by police in central London.The 31-year-old Frenchman, who captains the north London side, admitted a charge of drink driving at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday. He was fined £50,000 and banned from driving for 20 months.Lloris was driving his 2018-plate Porsche Panamera along Gloucester Place, Marylebone, on 24 August when he was pulled over during a routine stop by police. The court heard Lloris provided a sample containing 80 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath – the legal limit in England and Wales is 35 microgrammes.Prosecutor Henry Fitch said police in an unmarked car spotted Lloris’ vehicle driving at 15mph in a 30mph zone. He also veered his car “towards parked vehicles” before correcting himself. When police stopped the vehicle, they discovered vomit and said Lloris had to be helped from the car.Defending, David Sonn said Lloris’ “spectacular fall from grace was not lost” on the goalkeeper. The court heard the goalkeeper had been dining in a restaurant and was showered with drinks from fellow diners.Sentencing Lloris, magistrate Amanda Barron said the fine represented the seriousness of the offence as well as the goalkeeper’s financial means – though details of his salary were not disclosed in court.“This is a very serious offence, as you know,” she said. “Not only were you putting your own life at risk but also that of your passenger. It was pure luck that you did not cause damage to other vehicles or pedestrians in the central London area.”Lloris, wearing a dark suit and no tie, was flanked by two members of his entourage as he made his way from his vehicle into the court, confronted by dozens of photographers and video journalists.Lloris, of East Finchley, north London, signed for Spurs from Lyon in 2012, making 209 appearances in the Premier League and keeping 75 clean sheets. He has also won more than 100 international caps and lifted the World Cup during the summer, after France beat Croatia 4-2 in the final. He did not make the squad for Spurs’ last league match, a 2-1 defeat at Watford, on 2 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e2e4a7ea3cebd67044637dd86a3cc140fbdce1/0_1_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e80505016709f7b874547c5fe5b2242","title":"the nations league and wycombes marcus bean football weekly","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Andy Brassell and Wycombe midfielder Marcus Bean to discuss the home nations, Nicklas Bendtner’s latest scrape, Ryan Babel’s return and Adil Rami’s proposal misfireJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Experts and  readers give their best adviceWe all know we should be doing more, but how do we keep moving when our motivation slips, the weather takes a turn for the worse or life gets in the way? Try these 25 pieces of advice from experts and  readers to keep you going.Our reasons for beginning to exercise are fundamental to whether we will keep it up, says Michelle Segar, the director of the University of Michigan’s Sport, Health and Activity Research and Policy Center. Too often “society promotes exercise and fitness by hooking into short-term motivation, guilt and shame”. There is some evidence, she says, that younger people will go to the gym more if their reasons are appearance-based, but past our early 20s that doesn’t fuel motivation much. Nor do vague or future goals help (“I want to get fit, I want to lose weight”). Segar, the author of No Sweat: How the Simple Science of Motivation Can Bring You a Lifetime of Fitness, says we will be more successful if we focus on immediate positive feelings such as stress reduction, increased energy and making friends. “The only way we are going to prioritise time to exercise is if it is going to deliver some kind of benefit that is truly compelling and valuable to our daily life,” she says.The danger of the typical New Year resolutions approach to fitness, says personal trainer Matt Roberts, is that people “jump in and do everything – change their diet, start exercising, stop drinking and smoking – and within a couple of weeks they have lost motivation or got too tired. If you haven’t been in shape, it’s going to take time.” He likes the trend towards high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and recommends people include some, “but to do that every day will be too intense for most people”. Do it once (or twice, at most) a week, combined with slow jogs, swimming and fast walks – plus two or three rest days, at least for the first month. “That will give someone a chance of having recovery sessions alongside the high-intensity workouts.”It is helpful not to try to make yourself do things you actively dislike, says Segar, who advises thinking about the types of activities – roller-skating? Bike riding? – you liked as a child. But don’t feel you have to really enjoy exercise. “A lot of people who stick with exercise say: ‘I feel better when I do it.’” There are elements that probably will be enjoyable, though, such as the physical response of your body and the feeling of getting stronger, and the pleasure that comes with mastering a sport.“For many people, the obvious choices aren’t necessarily the ones they would enjoy,” says Sniehotta, who is also the director of the National Institute for Health Research’s policy research unit in behavioural science, “so they need to look outside them. It might be different sports or simple things, like sharing activities with other people.”Inidual motivation – or the lack of it – is only part of the bigger picture. Money, parenting demands or even where you live can all be stumbling blocks, says Sniehotta. Tiredness, depression, work stress or ill family members can all have an impact on physical activity. “If there is a lot of support around you, you will find it easier to maintain physical activity,” he points out. “If you live in certain parts of the country, you might be more comfortable doing outdoor physical activity than in others. To conclude that people who don’t get enough physical activity are just lacking motivation is problematic.”Segar suggests being realistic. “Skip the ideal of going to the gym five days a week. Be really analytical about work and family-related needs when starting, because if you set yourself up with goals that are too big, you will fail and you’ll feel like a failure. At the end of a week, I always ask my clients to reflect on what worked and what didn’t. Maybe fitting in a walk at lunch worked, but you didn’t have the energy after work to do it.”“If you need willpower to do something, you don’t really want to do it,” says Segar. Instead, think about exercise “in terms of why we’re doing it and what we want to get from physical activity. How can I benefit today? How do I feel when I move? How do I feel after I move?”Anything that allows you to exercise while ticking off other goals will help, says Sniehotta. “It provides you with more gratification, and the costs of not doing it are higher.” For instance, walking or cycling to work, or making friends by joining a sports club, or running with a friend. “Or the goal is to spend more time in the countryside, and running helps you do that.”Try to combine physical activity with something else. “For example, in my workplace I don’t use the lift and I try to reduce email, so when it’s possible I walk over to people,” says Sniehotta. “Over the course of the day, I walk to work, I move a lot in the building and I actually get about 15,000 steps. Try to make physical activity hit as many meaningful targets as you can.”When you take up running, it can be tiring just getting out of the door – where are your shoes? Your water bottle? What route are you going to take? After a while, points out Sniehottta, “there are no longer costs associated with the activity”. Doing physical activity regularly and planning for it “helps make it a sustainable behaviour”. Missing sessions doesn’t.What if you don’t have time to exercise? For many people, working two jobs or with extensive caring responsibilities, this can undoubtedly be true, but is it genuinely true for you? It might be a question of priorities, says Sniehotta. He recommends planning: “The first is ‘action planning’, where you plan where, when and how you are going to do it and you try to stick with it.” The second type is ‘coping planning’: “anticipating things that can get in the way and putting a plan into place for how to get motivated again”. Segar adds: “Most people don’t give themselves permission to prioritise self-care behaviours like exercise.”A workout doesn’t have to take an hour, says Roberts. “A well-structured 15-minute workout can be really effective if you really are pressed for time.” As for regular, longer sessions, he says: “You tell yourself you’re going to make time and change your schedule accordingly.”It rains for a week, you don’t go running once and then you feel guilty. “It’s a combination of emotion and lack of confidence that brings us to the point where, if people fail a few times, they think it’s a failure of the entire project,” says Sniehotta. Remember it’s possible to get back on track.If previous exercise regimes haven’t worked, don’t beat yourself up or try them again – just try something else, he says. “We tend to be in the mindset that if you can’t lose weight, you blame it on yourself. However, if you could change that to: ‘This method doesn’t work for me, let’s try something different,’ there is a chance it will be better for you and it prevents you having to blame yourself, which is not helpful.”“We start to lose muscle mass over the age of around 30,” says Hollie Grant, a personal training and pilates instructor, and the owner of PilatesPT. Resistance training (using body weight, such as press-ups, or equipment, such as resistance bands) is important, she says: “It is going to help keep muscle mass or at least slow down the loss. There needs to be some form of aerobic exercise, too, and we would also recommend people start adding balance challenges because our balance is affected as we get older.”“If you do 5k runs and you don’t know if you should push faster or go further, rate your exertion from one to 10,” says Grant. “As you see those numbers go down, that’s when to start pushing yourself a bit faster.” Roberts says that, with regular exercise, you should be seeing progress over a two-week period and pushing yourself if you feel it is getting easier. “You’re looking for a change in your speed or endurance or strength.”If you have caring responsibilities, Roberts says you can do a lot within a small area at home. “In a living room, it is easy to do a routine where you might alternate between doing a leg exercise and an arm exercise,” he says. “It’s called Peripheral Heart Action training. Doing six or eight exercises, this effect of going between the upper and lower body produces a pretty strong metabolism lift and cardiovascular workout.” Try squats, half press-ups, lunges, tricep dips and glute raises. “You’re raising your heart rate, working your muscles and having a good general workout.” These take no more than 15-20 minutes and only require a chair for the tricep dips – although dumbbells can be helpful, too.We are often told that housework and gardening can contribute to our weekly exercise targets, but is it that simple? “The measure really is you’re getting generally hot, out of breath, and you’re working at a level where, if you have a conversation with somebody while you’re doing it, you’re puffing a bit,” says Roberts. “With gardening, you’d have to be doing the heavier gardening – digging – not just weeding. If you’re walking the dog, you can make it into a genuine exercise session – run with the dog, or find a route that includes some hills.”Joslyn Thompson Rule, a personal trainer, says: “The general rule is if it’s above the neck – a headache or a cold – while being mindful of how you’re feeling, you are generally OK to do some sort of exercise. If it’s below the neck – if you’re having trouble breathing – rest. The key thing is to be sensible. If you were planning on doing a high-intensity workout, you would take the pace down, but sometimes just moving can make you feel better.” After recovering from an illness, she says, trust your instincts. “You don’t want to go straight back into training four times a week. You might want to do the same number of sessions but make them shorter, or do fewer.”Clearly, how quickly you start exercising again depends on the type of injury, and you should seek advice from your doctor. Psychologically, though, says Thompson Rule: “Even when we’re doing everything as we should, there are still dips in the road. It’s not going to be a linear progression of getting better.”For goal-oriented people, Grant says, it can be useful to monitor progress closely, but “allow some flexibility in your goals. You might have had a stressful day at work, go out for a run and not do it as quickly and then think: ‘I’m just not going to bother any more.’” However, “It can start to get a bit addictive, and then you don’t listen to your body and you’re more at risk of injury.” “Winter is not necessarily a time to hibernate,” says Thompson Rule. Be decisive, put your trainers by the door and try not to think about the colddrizzlegreyness. “It’s the same with going to the gym – it’s that voice in our head that make us feel like it’s a hassle, but once you’re there, you think: ‘Why was I procrastinating about that for so long?’”I’ve tried and failed a few times to establish a consistent running routine, but that was because I kept pushing myself too hard. Just because I can run for an hour doesn’t mean I should. Running two or three times a week for 20-30 minutes each time has improved my fitness hugely and made it easier to fit in. I keep a large bag of Midget Gems in my car to motivate myself to get to the gym, allowing myself a handful before a workout. Sometimes I toss in some wine gums for the element of surprise.I tapped into the vast network of fitness podcasts and online communities. On days I lacked drive, I would listen to a fitness podcast, and by the time I got home, I would be absolutely determined to make the right choices. In fact, I would be excited by it. Your brain responds very well to repetition and reinforcement, so once you have made the difficult initial change, it becomes much easier over time. I have kept a “star chart” on my calendar for the past two years, after having three years of being chronically unfit. I put a gold star on days that I exercise, and it’s a good visual motivator for when I am feeling slug-like. I run, use our home cross-trainer and do a ski fitness programme from an app. My improved core strength has helped my running and ability to carry my disabled child when needed.If, like me, you need to get up early to exercise or it just doesn’t happen, move your alarm clock away from your bed and next to your kit.

When you test the skills of those people you actually see that those people don’t have the kind of skills that would be associated with a university degree.”The OECD director was speaking at the London launch of the OECD’s annual Education at a Glance survey for 2018, which compares educational systems and attainment in countries around the world.Though the UK has succeeded in opening up access to universities, with more than half of young adults now going on to higher education, the report points out that tuition fees in England – which now stand at £9,250 a year – are higher than any other OECD country apart from the US.“We have no indication that the UK economy does not need more advanced skills. The question is more about, how can we ensure that every university degree gives young people the kind of skills that they have paid for.”Schleicher called on the government to provide greater quality assurance for students.“I do believe that a government that asks students to pay significant fees should also have a hard look at the quality of the services that are being provided to deliver for those students.”The education secretary, Damian Hinds, said the studyhighlighted the strengths of the UK education system, placing it among the top three countries for education spending as a proportion of gross domestic product. On universities, he said the UK offered some of the most generous support for students in OECD countries.“The result of this is that, as the report recognises, we have high levels of young people in education or employment, the financial gains from going to university outstrip the cost, and people are more likely to continue learning throughout their lives.”A separate piece of research, meanwhile, has suggested that a degree from a non-elite university may damage the job prospects of women from wealthy backgrounds who are less likely to find secure employment than if they have no degree at all.Researcher Maria Holcekova analysed survey data on 4,281 women in England from different socio-economic backgrounds to examine the effects of their educational qualifications on their careers.“Graduating from non-Russell Group university increases the probability of insecure employment, such as shift work or zero-hours contracts, compared to those without a degree,” said Holcekova."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68776de8fcd9f62e9d9f4e7f105c582178941120/368_150_1974_1185/master/1974.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d59b61d6175e8b14211209fa4192268","title":"uk should remain eus closest ally after brexit may tells cabinet","story":"Exclusive: Letters ask states to engage with UK in side deals on transport if Brexit talks failDominic Raab has been reprimanded by Michel Barnier after the EU’s chief negotiator discovered the British government had written to the 27 other member states asking for side negotiations on transport in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The Brexit secretary was confronted by Barnier during their most recent meeting in Brussels over correspondence sent in recent days to EU capitals by the Department for Transport.The letters had asked the member states to prepare to engage with the British government in side deals on aviation and haulage, to allow key trade flows to continue in the event of the UK and the EU failing to come to an agreement on leaving the union by 29 March 2019.The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, had ordered the letters to be sent despite being told less than two weeks ago by the European commission’s most senior trade official, Violeta Bulc, that without a deal this autumn, there would be no other agreements made to protect the UK economy.Barnier is said to have reiterated that message to Raab, telling the cabinet minister: “If there is no deal, there is no trust.”The bruising exchange came on the same day that Theresa May told cabinet members the UK should remain “the EU’s closest ally” after Brexit, amid a growing belief in Downing Street that progress was gradually being made in the long-running orce talks.The prime minister told ministers on Tuesday that she would travel to Salzburg, Austria, for an informal EU council meeting next Wednesday, where she is expected to briefly address other leaders over dinner in an attempt to sell the idea of a deal based on her Chequers proposals.Downing Street is setting a low bar for success at Salzburg in the belief that the most important thing at this stage is that Chequers is not ruled out. Salzburg would be “a staging post in exit negotiations”, her spokesman said in a briefing for reporters.The spokesman added that May told the cabinet she hoped to “build on the constructive engagement of the summer” by “underlining the importance to both parties of remaining the EU’s closest ally” after Brexit.No 10 has become cautiously hopeful that a Chequers-style deal has a chance of success, trusting that the orce talks will ultimately come down to an intense period of last-minute negotiating in the runup to a final Brexit summit expected in the middle of November.Officials believe Barnier has softened his public position in the last few days. Last week, Barnier reportedly told a delegation of British MPs from the Brexit select committee that he believed Chequers was “dead”, because it would require the EU to compromise over fundamental principles on the operation of the single market.On Tuesday, however, Barnier said it was realistic to believe that a deal could be agreed within the next two months. “If we are realistic, I want to reach an agreement on the first stage of the negotiation, which is the Brexit treaty, within six or eight weeks,” he said.May’s negotiating plan remains intensely unpopular on the right of her own party. At least 20 MPs have told her to “chuck Chequers” and propose a Canada-style free trade deal as an alternative.There is particular unhappiness that the prime minister proposed that the UK share a “common rulebook” for food and goods with the EU after Brexit, which critics say amounts to the UK becoming a “rule-taker” from Brussels.Debates about whether Chequers is appropriate are expected to dominate the Conservative party conference at the end of September, which is partly why it remains critical for May to ensure that EU leaders do not summarily reject the proposals in Salzburg.May will leave Salzburg after a Thursday morning discussion on chemical weapons, with the remaining EU leaders staying to discuss the Chequers plan.Responding to the row between Raab and Barnier over the 27 letters, an EU official said: “We are working for the withdrawal agreement, which is a deal to avoid a no deal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a26a61819a8d7ae103c2404d2abf9e03f0888bf5/0_156_3125_1875/master/3125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dd1c65ce7fb533ae471ee5cc02d5007","title":"juncker scorns chequers proposals state of union speech eu brexit","story":"Key tenet of UK’s Brexit plan dismissed along with proposals for rival to Galileo satelliteJean-Claude Juncker has ruled out the central plank of Theresa May’s Chequers proposals and scorned the British government’s plans to build a rival to the EU’s Galileo satellite project, in a downcast reading of the Brexit negotiations in his annual state of the union speech.The European commission president said Brussels would not let the UK enjoy the benefits of an internal market on goods, and that if negotiators failed to find an agreement on a deal it would not be the fault of the commission.“We respect the British decision to leave our union, even though we continue to regret it deeply,” Juncker said in his speech to MEPs in Strasbourg. “But we also ask the British government to understand that someone who leaves the union cannot be in the same privileged position as a member state.“If you leave the union, you are of course no longer part of our single market, and certainly not only in the parts of it you choose.”He said of the EU’s chief negotiator: “Michel Barnier stands ready to work day and night to reach a deal … It will not be the commission that will stand in the way.”Juncker offered May some warm words in response to her calls for an unprecedented deal, telling MEPs he agreed with “the statement made in Chequers that the starting point for such a partnership should be a free trade area between the UK and the EU”.In a deal proposed earlier in the year, the EU had suggested trade in goods should be free of tariffs, a move May has insisted would not be sufficient to maintain economic wellbeing on both sides of the Channel and Irish Sea.In comments that positively moved the pound on the currency markets, Juncker said: “The United Kingdom will never be an ordinary third country for us. The United Kingdom will always be a very close neighbour and partner in political, economic and security terms.”However, his tone was generally gloomy and he issued warnings over a no-deal exit and the Irish border issue, which has proved to be the biggest obstacle to an agreement.Juncker said the EU would not let Ireland down in negotiations to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland. The UK agreed last December and in March this year to sign up to a “backstop” solution to prevent such a border emerging in any scenario after Brexit, but the government has ruled out EU proposals that in effect would keep Northern Ireland in the single market and customs union, and it is yet to offer a workable alternative, according to Brussels.Noisiest in their opposition are Tory Brexiters, not least David Davis and Boris Johnson, both of whom quit the cabinet in protest. They argue that the promise to maintain a common rulebook for goods and other continued alignment will mean a post-Brexit UK is tied to the EU without having a say on future rules, rather than being a free-trading independent nation.Labour has also disparaged the proposal, expressing deep scepticism about the so-called facilitated customs arrangement system.Brussels has sought to stay positive, but has deep concerns about elements of the plan viewed as overly pick-and-mix, and thus potentially incompatible with EU principles.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, says he opposes both the customs plan and the idea of alignment for goods. He also makes plain his contention that the Chequers plan contains no workable idea for the Ireland-Northern Ireland border.But at the same time the EU has been careful to not entirely dismiss the proposals, raising the possibility it could accept some adapted version.Officially, May and her cabinet, though even here the backing can seem lukewarm at times. Asked about Chequers, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said it was the government’s plan “right now”, indicating alternative ideas could be considered.Even May’s allies concede it will be a hugely difficult task to get the plan through parliament. Damian Green, the PM’s close friend and former de fact deputy, described the process as “walking a narrow path with people chucking rocks at us from both sides”.On the remain side of the Conservatives, the former education secretary Justine Greening called the Chequers plan “more unpopular than the poll tax”, saying May should start again from scratch.If anything can save the plan – and it’s an outside shot – it will be a combination of the hugely tight timetable and the fact that, as yet, no one else has yet produced a plan with a better chance of being accepted by parliament.On 20 September, an informal gathering in Salzburg, Austria, will provide a snapshot of current EU thinking. Then, 10 days later, the Conservative conference could show the Chequers plan is holed below the waterline.If it survives these tests, the proposals will then reach the crucial EU summit Brussels on 18 October, with something final needed, at the very latest, in the next two months. PETER WALKERUrging the UK to live up to the commitments it had made, Juncker said: “The European commission, this parliament and all other 26 member states will always show loyalty and solidarity with Ireland when it comes to the Irish border.“This is why we want to find a creative solution that prevents a hard border in Northern Ireland … It is not the European Union, it is Brexit that risks making the border more visible in Northern Ireland.”According to a commission release of the speech, Juncker had been due to issue a warning to May that the EU would be “very outspoken should the British government walk away from its responsibilities under the Good Friday agreement”, the Northern Ireland peace treaty. In the event, he did not make the threat.Juncker did, however, scorn claims from the British government that it would go it alone and build its own satellite if the EU did not allow UK industry and its military to have continued access to the bloc’s Galileo programme after Brexit.“It is our Galileo programme that is today keeping Europe in the space race. No single member state could have put 26 satellites in orbit, for the benefit of 400 million users worldwide. No single member state could have done this alone,” he said.The UK government has contributed over £1.2bn to the Galileo satellite navigation system, which is intended to rival the US-controlled global positioning system. Once fully operational in 2020 it will provide accurate position, navigation and timing information to be used by governments, citizens, industry and the military.The EU has ruled out the continued involvement of the British space industry after Brexit as it is a benefit reserved for member states.Elsewhere in his speech, Juncker unveiled plans to strengthen the EU’s coastguard and asylum agency to police Europe’s outside borders and speed the deportation of migrants illegally staying in the EU.A standing corps of 10,000 staff, including guards and migration experts, is expected to be up and running by 2020, and they would be given powers to check ID papers and stamp travel documents, detain people who are crossing the border without authorisation, and help ensure those not eligible are deported."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f38461592d1e8acd4fcd5bf66176d9cebcf3889f/0_122_6106_3663/master/6106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b062e86911a041c5854ed67d4200c2f8","title":"pro brexit tory mps openly discuss how to get rid of theresa may michael gove","story":"Michael Gove criticises ‘loose talk’ after meeting discussed timing of confidence voteConservative MPs have openly discussed methods of ousting the prime minister at a private meeting of hardline Brexiters.At the gathering on Tuesday night of the European Research Group (ERG) of more than 50 Eurosceptic MPs, sources said MPs in the Thatcher room in Portcullis House discussed the timing of a possible confidence vote in the prime minister if she did not ditch her Chequers plan.One said there was “an utter lack of dissent” in the room about the need to replace May. “They ran through the ‘how to’ options. It was not a question of ‘should do’,” they said.After a feverish night of mounting dissent in Westminster, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, called for calm. “The critical thing is we need to make sure there is unity in the Conservative party behind the prime minister,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday.Noisiest in their opposition are Tory Brexiters, not least David Davis and Boris Johnson, both of whom quit the cabinet in protest.

PETER WALKER“This is loose talk and the critical thing is we deliver on the Brexit mandate, and any ersion or distraction from that commitment means our ability to ensure that it is delivered is undermined.”At the meeting, sources said it was younger MPs who did the bulk of the talking, and veterans of the Eurosceptic movement, including Bill Cash, Iain Duncan Smith and Bernard Jenkin, were not present.“Possibly one of them would have formally decried open leadership talk if they had been present,” the source said.A confidence vote would require 48 MPs to send letters of no confidence to Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories.However, May would need only a simple majority to see off a challenge and Downing Street is confident Conservative rebels do not have the numbers to topple her. If she defeated a no-confidence vote, the prime minister could not be challenged again for another year.No 10 hosted sceptical Tory MPs on Tuesday night for a dinner with May’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, and director of communications, Robbie Gibb. Guests included the fierce critics John Baron and Andrew Bridgen, who has publicly declared that he has submitted his letter of no confidence in the prime minister.Speaking to ITV outside Downing Street, Baron said the MPs had discussed “leadership issues”. Asked whose leadership was under discussion, Baron said: “You guess.”Bridgen said he too had raised the issue of May’s leadership. “I’m told she will get a full appraisal of comments that were made at the dinner. I hope the prime minister will take on board what she’s heard and chuck Chequers, and we can move to the super Canada free-trade deal that would best serve our exit from the European Union,” he said.The former Brexit minister Steve Baker, a key member of the anti-Chequers campaign, has claimed 80 Tory MPs would vote against the prime minister’s plan, but said they were not trying to force a “no deal” outcome. “We are all agreed it would be preferable to leave smoothly into an agreement,” he said.May is holding a no-deal cabinet meeting on Thursday at which ministers will discuss plans in the event of the government failing to reach an agreement with Brussels.The prime minister has challenged Brexiters to publish their alternative plan, but ERG members appear to have struggled to agree on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland, a main sticking point in discussions with Brussels.A plan to brief journalists about a proposed solution to the Northern Irish border was pulled on Tuesday and is now expected on Wednesday. The group’s chairman, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said it was a plan that “any reasonable person” would accept and could include tax inspectors conducting spot checks in factories on goods for export."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64eada7607f37a92de17008a8a40a620bffd7ad2/0_92_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ca0b5aecb830e960b44119b44f1fe45","title":"tory brexiter group publishes plan for checks away from irish border","story":"European Research Group reveals plan for customs checks away from border Theresa May has failed to challenge the position taken by the EU on the Irish border, allowing it to become “a decisive factor” in the Brexit negotiations, according to the hard Brexit European Research Group, which has been discussing whether to attempt to unseat the prime minister.A position paper on the future of the Irish border, presented by David Davis and a string of Tories hostile to May’s Chequers plan, concedes that the UK will have to sign up to “equivalence of UK and EU regulations” for food products and standards.But it claims it will be possible to do that by the UK and EU maintaining a system of customs checks away from the border. The paper says: “Repetitive trade is well suited to established technical solutions and simplified customs procedures already available.”Two former Northern Ireland secretaries, Owen Paterson and Theresa Villiers, were due to speak at the launch event, in a further sign that the ERG rebellion against May is hardening into a group openly defying the prime minister’s authority.Noisiest in their opposition are Tory Brexiters, not least David Davis and Boris Johnson, both of whom quit the cabinet in protest.

PETER WALKERAlso on the podium were the chair of the ERG, Jacob Rees-Mogg, and the former Northern Ireland first minister David Trimble.Rees-Mogg said the ERG’s goal was not to challenge May but to force her to ditch the Chequers plan. “I have long said and repeated that policy needs to be changed but I’m supporting the person,” he said. May was a “fantastic and dutiful” prime minister and she “has my support”.The report accuses the EU of ignoring unionist opinion in Northern Ireland in negotiations on the Irish border question. “It is now accepted that the European commission has made a major error in taking advice on matters relating to the island of Ireland almost solely from Dublin. It must seek to learn more from respected voices in Northern Ireland,” the report says.Earlier the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said the EU would always show “loyalty and solidarity” with the Republic of Ireland on the issue of its border with Northern Ireland. Delivering his state of the union speech, Juncker said: “We will defend all the elements of the Good Friday agreement. It is Brexit that risks making the border more visible in Northern Ireland. It is not the European Union.”On Tuesday Downing Street reiterated that Chequers was “the only serious, credible and negotiable plan which is on the table which both delivers on the will of the British people and which prevents the imposition of a hard border in Northern Ireland.”The ERG paper says larger companies could use “trusted trader” schemes to clear their goods for export and import, and other declarations could be incorporated into the existing system used for VAT returns.“The EU will be able to maintain the integrity of its internal market without erecting a hard border along its border with Northern Ireland,” it says. “At the same time, the United Kingdom will be able to develop a fully independent trade policy rather than remaining a rule-taker. The one element of ‘alignment’ necessary is the maintenance of the current common biosecurity zone covering the island of Ireland, and this is not contentious.“The necessary procedures described can all be implemented within the existing legal and operational frameworks of the EU and the UK, based on the mutual trust on which regular trade depends.“Rational, pragmatic approaches can ensure that the vital trade across the border is maintained. At the same time, this allows the United Kingdom to conduct an independent trade policy without threatening the integrity of the EU single market.”The group said its proposals could be delivered without the need for any new infrastructure at the border and without weakening north-south cooperation. “There is nothing which would reduce our commitment to the Belfast agreement or which might jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b44e70b853fe295bdc8675bc74a9be21c1f048e8/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=079f82e06405eb32e20c9f10dbe4f380","title":"the feline timeline a history of cats from ancient egypt to instagram","story":"Celebrated and persecuted in equal measure, cats have been with us since the dawn of civilisation, featuring in verse, literature and film. Kate Wills explains why cat history is our historyThere is a saying that “nobody owns a cat”, but archaeological remains suggest that wildcats have been slinking inside huts for treats and strokes for around 9,000 years. Scientists recently discovered that all of today’s domestic cats descend from one subspecies of African wildcat, and that our ancestors could be ided into cat or dog people as early as the stone age.Perhaps the ultimate “cat people” were the Egyptians, who worshipped our feline friends to such an extent that they imposed the death penalty for killing one, shaved their eyebrows in grief when theirs died, and had them mummified and placed in purr-amids in readiness for the kitty afterlife. For ancient Romans, Felis silvestris catus was a symbol of liberty and an effective form of pest control. It was cats’ mice-bothering skills that allowed them to pad across Asia, where dedicated mousers protected silkworm cocoons and treasured manuscripts from rodents.The middle ages were a bit of a low period in the history of catkind, as felines were cast as symbols of “sinful” female sexuality and witchcraft by the church. In Malleus Maleficarum, the medieval treatise on witchcraft usually translated as The Witch Hammer, a 13th-century folk story depicts three witches that turn themselves into cats and attack a man. From then on witches were believed to have cats as sidekicks, or to change into feline form in the night. But by the 15th century, cats were coming back into favour, helped in part by the legend of Dick Whittington, who made his fortune thanks to his rat-killing kitty. This kitty may or may not have worn boots in real life – and may or may not have sounded like Antonio Banderas.It was around this time that cat-fans started breeding moggies for particular coat colours and textures. Kitty genetics is a fascinating field. Cats come in two dominant colours – black and red – that are “diluted” or “masked” to become “blue” (appearing grey) or “cream”. The red colour is only carried on the X chromosome, which is why tortoiseshell cats are nearly always female, and ginger cats are nearly always male. (This is all great trivia with which to impress your cat-loving andor geneticist friends, by the way.)There have been many “crazy cat ladies” – and gentlemen, for that matter – throughout history, notably Cardinal Richelieu (AKA the baddie in The Three Musketeers), who had 14 cats at the time of his death in 1642, including Ludovic le Cruel, so named because of his savage dedication to killing rats. Catherine the Great of Russia turned the Winter Palace into a cattery, with her favoured breed of Russian blues running wild upstairs and a basement full of “working cats” that she promoted to guard status, complete with salaries and extra food rations. Winston Churchill kept cats at Chartwell, while Abraham Lincoln was such a cat obsessive that he fed his kittens Tabby and Dixy at the table at a state dinner, and regularly took in strays to the White House.As cats became a popular indoor pet – no doubt helped by the invention of cat litter in 1947 – they clawed their way into popular culture, too. Whole essays have been written on the cartoon cat, from Sylvester the Cat, who first appeared in 1939, right up to Pokémon’s Meowth, via Felix, Top Cat, Garfield, Bagpuss and the Aristocats. Not to forget Alice’s Cheshire Cat, which also appeared in cartoon form in the 1951 Disney film.In a nod to the feline’s medieval association with evil, cats also became the purr-fect accomplice for witches, Bond villains and, in homage, Mike Myers’s Dr Evil. They were also the animal ally of choice for breakfasters at Tiffany’s, the alien-battling Ripley in the otherwise very non-furry Alien films, and leather-loving Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman herself in Batman Returns.But it’s the internet that has taken cats from much-loved pet to feline overlord. From “I can has cheezburger” memes to Grumpy Cat, via the 52 million people who have watched a ginger cat called Fatso play a keyboard, Brits share 3.8m cat pictures and videos every day. Meanwhile, social media has made stars of some pampered pusses, such as Karl Lagerfeld’s fluffy white Birman, Choupette (112.4k followers), Kitty Purry (Katy Perry’s cat) and Taylor Swift’s two cats, who now have their own merchandise line, the Meredith and Olivia Swift collection.But before memes there was poetry. In the ninth century, an Irish monk wrote a poem about his cat, Pangur Bán. For Baudelaire, the cat’s meow was the very source of his verse. When Romantic poet Robert Southey’s cat, Rumpelstiltskin, finally went for his great catnap in the sky, Southey wrote: “There should be a court mourning in Catland.” Meanwhile, Thomas Gray was composing an Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat Drowned in a Tub of Goldfishes. If only they’d been alive in 2002, when the first cloned kitten – the aptly named “CC” – was born.And while Kristen Roupenian’s viral New Yorker short story Cat Person could stake a claim, the most famous feline work of literature has to be TS Eliot’s Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats. Fitting, then, that Andrew Lloyd Webber’s record-breaking 1981 musical version is about to get a big screen reboot, starring – who else? – contemporary cat woman Taylor Swift.

Here’s what your cat’s age really means – and how to handle the changes that come with itOnce kittens pass the newborn phase, where they should be with their mothers, and begin to grow and engage with the outside world, they will discover play. Kitten play mimics moves that would be used for hunting such as stalking, ambushing and pawing. Help your kitten hone these skills, which also keep them active, by making time to play with them using age- and size-appropriate toys.TrainingToilet training should start using a size-appropriate litter tray as soon as your kitten comes home. Gentle grooming and recall training can start now too, use treats to encourage them to respond to their name when called, or use a clicker just before you feed them so they associate that with reward.FeedingWeaned kittens do not need any kind of cat or kitten milk, but they do need a good quality protein-rich food. “Kittens have immature digestive systems and so need an easily digestible food, and once they have stopped feeding from their mother they need to build up their own immunity, so food must have the right nutrients, such as an antioxidant complex, to help bridge the gap while they are developing their own systems,” explains Hannah Poile, scientific communications manager at Royal Canin.Kittens go from sucking, to licking to crunching a kibble, so food that is hydratable is desirable. “A growth formula with calcium and phosphorous in the right levels to promote skeletal growth is also best for them at this stage,” says Poile.Between three and six months your kitten is headed towards sexual maturity, so it’s best to have your kitty neutered (and microchipped). Liaise with your vet around exact timings. After neutering it’s best to change to a specific neutered kitten diet, this will ensure they’re still getting all the nutrients they need for healthy growth, but will take into account the specific needs following this procedure.Your kitten should be fully grown by 12 months, unless it is a larger breed such as a Maine coon, which may not reach its adult size until around 15 months. During this phase – you could refer to it as the equivalent of teenage years in humans – your cat will become more demanding of both their owner and the world they live in. Keep them entertained by making sure there is plenty to stimulate them mentally and physically.Continue with grooming and introduce ear and teeth checks, perhaps follow this up with attention and affection rather than treats to prevent any issues with weight.FeedingAn appropriate older kitten food that will give the right level of nutrition for this second growth phase is best, along with food that specifically promotes balance in their intestinal flora is also recommended.This is prime time for your cat: they should be physically fit and well, with a glossy coat, bright eyes and plenty of get up and go. They will be hunting regularly (if they have access to outside spaces) or play hunting if an indoor cat.At this stage, your cat will respond well to games, so keep their toys varied and available, especially for indoor cats keep their weight monitored, teeth clean and stay up to date with worming, flea treatments and annual boosters.FeedingAged 12 months it’s time to transition your cat from kitten to adult food. “Make sure you are feeding it an activity-appropriate diet. Are they an indoor or an outdoor cat?” says Poile. “Indoor cats are generally less active and, if not fed a diet with the right level of calories, can easily gain weight.”“Naturally, cats eat little and often – they are grazers and will have up to 15 sittings a day. If you are supporting the species as it would eat naturally you would have food down for them so they can go back to it when they want it, activity feeders are great for encouraging natural feeding habits.”By the age of seven your cat will start to experience the early and often invisible changes that come with ageing. They may be more prone to weight gain, dental problems and joint issues. Help by making sure they keep active through play and monitor any changes in their coat, behaviour or feeding pattern. Encourage activity with a variety of mixed toys. Make sure they have to work a bit to get their food – they enjoy seeking it out.FeedingHelp to support your cat as they start to face the first signs of ageing with a diet adapted to this life stage containing targeted nutrients, such as vitamins and green tea polyphenols, to help maintain their vitality. Don’t forget to keep checking your cat’s body condition score and adapt their feeding amounts to keep them at a healthy bodyweight.At this age, your cat is likely to start to experience age-related health issues such as joint pain, a reduction in kidney function, weight loss and a decline in activity. They can also become fussy about food and may be less able to adapt to changes in their environment, so it’s best not to introduce any major changes to their routine or domestic life. Your cat may begin to show signs of cognitive dysfunction towards the older end of this life stage, monitor their behaviour for signs of confusion, which should be discussed with your vet.Feeding“A senior diet is very important for this age group,” says Poile. “Just as with kittens, older cats need food that supports their changing appetites, many older cats become fussier about their diet and may appreciate an adapted kibble or wet food. Kidney health is also a concern as cats age and it is important for regular checkups at the vet, as well as to feed a diet with an adapted level of phosphorous.”The elderly cat can struggle with regulating body temperature and have fairly extensive dental issues – oral disease or tooth loss can make eating difficult. So, it’s important to provide a palatable and digestible diet.Your cat may lose weight for no obvious reason, monitor their condition, coat and overall behaviour. Any concerns should be raised with your vet. They may struggle to groom regularly as they become less flexible, so maintain regular grooming sessions with them.Your cat is likely to sleep more and can be prone to senile changes. They can seem to be lost, unable to find their food or water or usual sleeping place, so be there to care for them.FeedingAs cats age, their bodies are less able to process and get nutrients from their food, so weight loss can occur. Be sure to feed them an age-appropriate food that has a high palatability and increased calorie content. Older cats can have issues with their sense of smell so a food with a rich aroma can help.All kittens should be fed according to the size they will become as an adult cat. For advice speak to your vet or consult a nutritional advice line such as Royal Canin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6747c5f84e129cfa22436c5b87dd17c42035bd8/1_0_6305_3784/master/6305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=625529a187400f959bb2cdb9bfdcadde","title":"freeze eggs before 35 better chance ivf success report","story":"Age at time of freezing is key to whether fertility treatment will succeed, says UK regulatorFor women intending to undergo IVF treatment using frozen eggs, the younger they are when they are frozen the greater the chance of a successful pregnancy, according to a report by the UK’s independent fertility regulator.Most IVF treatment cycles use fresh eggs, but a very small number use eggs that have been frozen and thawed. It can, for example, be especially beneficial for cancer patients who decide to freeze their eggs before undergoing chemotherapy.The report by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) looked at data from UK fertility clinics from 2010 to 2016, and found that the key factor for successful pregnancies is the age at which women freeze their eggs.If women freeze their eggs when they are younger than 35, the chances of a successful pregnancy after IVF become higher than the natural conception rate as they get older – but the current average age at which women have their eggs frozen is 38. Women’s age when the eggs are thawed has little impact.In the report, the HFEA cautions against freezing eggs over the age of 40, since “the likelihood of a pregnancy from these eggs would be very slim”.Since 1999, when the first baby was born from the technology, the number of egg-freezing cycles in the UK has increased each year, and it has more than doubled since 2013. In 2016, 156 babies were born from frozen eggs.But while egg freezing is increasing across the UK, it is still a rare procedure just 178 women had the treatment in 2016.“The report hints at an emergent technology which is a boon for those who are undergoing chemotherapy,” said Alastair Sutcliffe, a professor of general paediatrics at University College London. “But it’s an invasive procedure and it’s not zero risk for the patient.”“Fertility is not just about eggs, it’s about the state of the person as a whole … the chances of pregnancy, as stated in the report, are still low, particularly when the woman’s own eggs are frozen.”“Egg-freezing technology in the right hands should be able to give success rates almost as good as conventional IVF,” said Simon Fishel, the founder of the Care Fertility Group, an independent IVF provider.If younger women are to freeze their eggs, the current law limiting the storage period to 10 years needs to be changed, according to Fishel. “The technology will change to become even better for women because we need it to,” he said. “Everyone who wants to have children and can’t should be helped.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77bdefec9da4d404ea2d743044305cca09f49098/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c05d24e55bf9811af0c1cafef478a76","title":"over 65s to be given more effective flu vaccine","story":"Public Health England says newly licensed drug FluAd will save 30,000 GP consultations and prevent 700 hospital deathsA flu vaccine that was licensed in Italy 20 years ago is to be used for the first time in the UK this winter in a bid to cut the death toll among older people from the infectious disease.Public Health England says the vaccine, only now available in England, could reduce GP consultations by 30,000, hospital visits by more than 2,000 and prevent more than 700 hospital deaths. It is an adjuvanted vaccine, which will boost the immune system of the over-65 age group and give them better protection than in the past.Last year flu took a big toll, particularly of older people. “Each year there are on average around 8,000 deaths from flu but last year there were about 15,000, significantly more than we usually see,” said Prof Paul Cosford, PHE’s medical director.Only the over-65s will get the adjuvanted vaccine, which contains three flu strains. Younger people and others who are vulnerable will get a new quadrivalent vaccine. There is no adjuvanted vaccine on the market at the moment which will protect against four strains of flu.The adjuvanted vaccine is called FluAd and is marketed by Seqirus, a company specialising in influenza that bought it from Novartis. The vaccine, first licensed in 1997, has been in use in Italy and Spain for many years.Dr Richard Pebody, head of flu for PHE, said they could not use the vaccine until the company got a UK licence, which it did last year.“Since we launched the seasonal flu vaccination programme in 2000, the best clinical guidance has been used to inform the vaccines issued,” he said. “We hope the adjuvanted vaccine will show improved effectiveness in elderly people and will help to prevent deaths and ease the burden on health services from flu.”All NHS staff will be urged to get vaccinated this year to protect themselves and their patients. Some NHS staff choose not to get the flu vaccine because they wrongly believe it could make them ill, according to Prof Jane Cummings, chief nurse for England. She said some “myths” persist around the vaccine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db3afad6164cdeafc77e7cfaebeb6d01d0ae408/0_213_2200_1319/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=730a8a7c77c4bae6798061267fa1090d","title":"tokyo 2020 organisers apologise for taking sailors to captive dolphin show","story":"British sailor Luke Patience calls choice ‘embarrassing’ for a sport that is supposed to protect marine lifeThe Japan Sailing Federation has apologised after a dolphin show was held for sailors competing in the World Cup Series, an event that also doubles as a test run for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.The competition, organised by a local committee in Enoshima, south of Tokyo, was intended to give the Games’ organisers an opportunity to gauge their level of readiness and to allow competitors to familiarise themselves with the course.But the opening ceremony ended in embarrassment after competitors were taken to the dolphin display, prompting criticism from British sailor Luke Patience.“Couldn’t be more embarrassed with what I’m witnessing. We are sailors, and apparently a ‘green’ sport,” Patience tweeted, along with the hash tag #sorrynature.In a follow-up post, Patience wrote: “Apologies for the language, and any offence I caused last night. I was shocked when world sailing took us to a dolphin aquarium for an opening ceremony. As a sport, I hope we can show more morality than this.”World Sailing said it was “disappointed” the opening event had included live dolphins, adding that the organisers had not sought its approval for the show.The governing body, whose remit includes protecting marine life, said in a statement it “does not condone displays of this nature and apologises for the misjudgment and any offence caused”.It added: “As part of World Sailing’s sustainability agenda 2030, there are specific targets linked to marine life. One of which is to mitigate negative impacts sailing can have on marine cetaceans by 2020 by producing guidance, as necessary, which will be provided to our event partners to ensure this does not happen again.”Hirobumi Kawano, the head of the Japan Sailing Federation, conceded the decision to include the dolphins showed a “lack of consideration” in light of global attempts to protect cetaceans.But he added that attitudes towards the treatment of dolphins “differ among countries and iniduals. We’d like to apologise if we made someone feel uncomfortable.”Japan has attracted widespread criticism over annual dolphin hunts in the Pacific town of Taiji, where the mammals are killed for their meat or selected for sale to aquariums and sea parks.In 2015, the Japan Association of Zoos and Aquariums agreed to stop buying dolphins from Taiji after it was threatened with expulsion from the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums.The aquarium in Enoshima, however, was one of two facilities that withdrew from the association, saying it wanted to continue its involvement in Taiji’s dolphin breeding programme.It said last year it had no plans to buy animals from the town, according to Kyodo news.Japan’s record on animal rights was criticised again last month after a dolphin, dozens of penguins and hundreds of fish were found to have been abandoned for months in a derelict aquarium."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28a262fc7ec790685bfd03055bef58847ebbcc5f/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4f0edb8a167531403e610e7a304a535","title":"iphone xs launch what to expect apple smartphone apple watch ipad pro rumours","story":"Company expected to launch new ‘iPhone XS’ smartphone, Apple Watch and iPad Pro this week, according to reportsApple’s yearly iPhone launch is scheduled for Wednesday evening, with expectations high for not just one new smartphone but a fleet of new iPhone X-inspired phones, a new smartwatch and maybe even new iPads.The headline announcement is expected to be a new iteration of the iPhone X with a 5.8in screen, possibly called “iPhone XS” according to reports. Since the “X” stands for 10, rather than the letter in Apple’s official naming, an XS would mirror similar “S” phones such as the iPhone 4S, 5S and 6S, rather than standing for iPhone “extra small” or “excess”.In the past such “S” iPhones have typically had improved internal components, but maintained a similar design and feature set to the iPhone model they replaced. The iPhone 4S introduced Siri, the iPhone 5S introduced Touch ID and the iPhone 6S 3D touch.The new iPhone X iteration is also expected to be joined by a larger version, possibly called the iPhone XS Max rather than “Plus”, “Pro” or other monikers as used in previous bigger versions such last year’s iPhone 8 Plus. The new larger iPhone X-like phone is expected to be more expensive than the starting price of £999 of 2017’s iPhone X, further stretching the expense of top-end smartphones.According to reports, Apple will also launch a cheaper version of the iPhone X design, unifying the entire 2018 iPhone line with the notched screen and Face ID facial recognition, dropping the Touch ID fingerprint scanner and home button.Apple has not launched a cheaper version of its iPhone since 2013’s iPhone 5C, which took the guts of the previous generation iPhone 5 and placed them in a coloured plastic body.Alongside the new iPhones, Apple is also expected to launch a new iteration of its smartwatch. The new Apple Watch is expected to have a similar design to the current Apple Watch 3, but potentially with a slightly larger screen squeezed into the same size body, according to reports.The Apple Watch has been a slow burn for the company, but has steadily grown in sales becoming a small but important part of Apple’s sales shipping 3.5m devices in Q2 2018 according to data from Canalys, but still dwarfed by the 41m iPhones shipped in the same time period.Although less likely, Apple may also launch new versions of its iPad Pro range. The company recently released a cheaper version of the iPad in March for £319, and before that a refreshed second-generation version of iPad Pro in June last year.But Apple’s tablets have struggled to convince buyers to upgrade in significant numbers, leaving the line to plateaux around the 9-13m units shipped a quarter over the last two years, down from the heady highs of 26m in the first quarter of 2014.Any new iPad Pro is expected to reflect the change in design language introduced with the iPhone X last year, dumping the long-standing home button and Touch ID for gestures and Face ID.The iPad has long had gestures that could in most cases replace the need for the home button, in switching between apps and getting to the home screen, so the full adoption of gestures over buttons seems logical. What remains to be seen is whether facial recognition can work as well on a tablet with its multiple orientations as it does on the iPhone X, which is primarily used when held in portrait orientation in the hand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3cf25d03351bfc43a545d666a1cf6073e9d8504/0_104_4247_2548/master/4247.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72389ae19e515e972a1750083d2e4fcf","title":"backpackers guide to sri lanka one month itinerary galle colombo","story":"The crowds head for its Cultural Triangle but Sri Lanka’s sights also include quieter national parks, hiking trails and beaches. Explore it with our guide on what to see and where to stayFew countries in Asia can offer such variety in a relatively small area, or are as easily navigable by bus and train – or even in your own tuk-tuk. Away from the main sights it’s easy to escape the crowds: instead of Mirissa, whale watch in quieter Kalpitiya – a laid-back destination for kitesurfing – and opt for Wilpattu national park over Yala national park for similar wildlife trips. In the hills, take the train to Haputale, rather than Ella, for less-trodden trails to scenic mountain viewpoints.In Colombo, stroll Galle Face Green, visit the National Museum or weave through the Pettah Market district with a host from Colombo City Walks. Stay at hip Bunkyard Hostels (see below). From here, head north to Kalpitiya (4½ hours by bus), an arid north-western peninsula with a chilled vibe, easy cycling through fishing hamlets and whale- and dolphin-watching trips that are light on crowds. Move onto Wilpattu national park (1½ hours by road), a vast reserve that is home to leopards, sloth bears and elephants.In the centre of the country, the Cultural Triangle brims with (expensive) world heritage sites, and visitors, but there are ways to find less-busy spots. Hike up Pidurangala for views back over Sigiriya’s rock fortress at a fraction of the cost, and instead of Dambulla’s cave temples, visit Ritigala, an ancient forest monastery dating to the first century BC. Visitors flock to Minneriya national park to see the elephants, yet nearby Kaudulla is just as good and cheaper to visit.En route to the Hill Country, stop in Kandy to visit the sacred Temple of the Tooth. The hills offer superb walking trails, tea estates and hidden waterfalls, and a railway line that cuts through the most dramatically scenic regions (check in to the Clock Inn – see below). Most backpackers head for Ella, the Hill Country’s de facto low-budget hangout, with its hostels (try the Hangover Hostel – see below), cafes, homestays and easy walks. However, also on the mainline railway is Haputale, a town with panoramic views onto the southern plains, walks (a favourite is to Lipton’s Seat viewpoint) and tea plantations (Dambatenne is my pick). While hostels haven’t quite reached Haputale, there are plenty of affordable guesthouses.From the hills, go east by bus to Arugam Bay (about 3 hours) for the island’s best surf or to visit lesser-known sites such as Kumana national park and the ancient coastal temple site of Muhudu Maha Viharaya, associated with the Ramayana story. Move on to the south coast next, perhaps stopping for a night in Wellawaya to see the seven 10th-century Buddhist rock reliefs at Buduruwagala (the tallest in Sri Lanka), before reaching Hiriketiya (4 to 5 hours by bus), a deep horseshoe-shaped surf bay with beach huts and guesthouses. Dots Bay House on the bay has three rooms and an open-sided dorm with beds from £13. The bay stretches to the quieter Dickwella Beach, a wide, sandy swathe. Mulkirigala rock temple – a mini cross between Sigiriya and Dambulla cave temples – is accessible from here.Buses are often overcrowded but cheap, and they go everywhere. Expect to pay about 30p for an hour of travel. Trains are a bargain, too, and more scenic, especially in the hills (the six-hour tea country stretch between Kandy and Ella is a must-do), though the cheapest carriages get jam-packed. It’s also possible to self-drive a tuk-tuk with tuktukrental, a social enterprise sourcing vehicles from local drivers. It helps obtain licences, while rates include full insurance, a driving lesson and a useful kit of spares.Although guesthouses are still the go-to option for cheap accommodation here, an increasing number of well-equipped hostels – offering wallet-friendly tours, bicycles and on-the-ball staff – are emerging in backpacking destinations such as Colombo, Dambulla, Ella, Mirissa, Weligama and Arugam Bay. Dorm beds in a hostel average £8 (rising to £16), while the cheapest guesthouse doubles go for about £12. Most hostels have doubles, too, and are generally more backpacker-orientated than guesthouses. Homestays are popular in more remote areas: Abode Tours offers homestays in Mannar (west coast) and the Knuckles – a bioerse mountain range that is superb for hiking and home to some of the island’s most remote villages. East N’ West On Board connects you with families in sedate Batticaloa, on the island’s east coast.Digital nomads are drawn to this sea-facing cafe-hostel near Dickwella on the south coast for its bijou rooms that are open to the outdoors. As well as dorms it also has doubles and a co-working space. The cafes and bars along surf-orientated Hiriketiya Beach are a 10-minute stroll away.• Dorms from £19, en suite doubles from £45, on FacebookClock Inn, KandyThis hostel is just 600 metres from the Tooth Temple and Kandy’s railway station, and close to the fruit market for cheap healthy snacks.

How did she become one of the UK’s best character actors? As someone who meticulously studies the people she plays – their origin, their background, everything from the glasses they wear to the way they look at you – Dolan might point to her birth 49 years ago, in Middlesborough general hospital. Her Irish parents, who had come to England for work and were living in Stockton-on-Tees, had previously moved around a lot due to demand for her father’s engineering skills. “There was a family joke that whenever my dad had painted the landing, they’d get notice that he’d have to move again,” she says.Shortly after she was born, the family moved again, finally settlingin Surrey. Here, Dolan was brought up, attended comprehensive school, and got her first taste of acting proper at youth theatre. One day, at the age of 14 or 15, travelling home from Northampton where the family had been visiting relatives,she was asked what she wanted to do with her life. “Sometimes you get those really weird opportunities when somebody asks you what you want to do and it really crystallises it for you,” she says. Rarely has the M1 been a route to such clarity.Before long, her appetite for performance had her sneaking into friends’ A-level drama classes. After school, and two years of auditioning,she gained a place at London’s prestigious Guildhall School of Music and Drama.In a sense, everything Dolan has achieved so far – from Tessa in JK Rowling’s The Casual Vacancy, to the Welsh BBC press officer Tracey in W1A and most recently her own foray into writing with the brilliant play The B*easts – can be traced back to these early years. But we must not forget Appropriate Adult, the 2011 drama in which she gave an electrifying portrayal of the serial killer Rosemary West. Not least because the role earned her a Bafta for best supporting actress.“It was absolutely extraordinary, that moment,” she recalls. “Walking down the steps to receive the Bafta, I could only go slowly because of the shoes I was wearing. I remember thinking to myself, ‘However long the music has to go on for me to get there, it’s not my responsibility – it’s their responsibility. So, I don’t have to rush.’ It was really funny and also it was obviously really nerve-racking to speak and accept it. I was so overcome.”The screenwriter and producer Russell T Davies has seen Dolan’s skill close up, after casting her as Marion Thorpe in A Very English Scandal, his take on the Jeremy Thorpe affair. Marion was Thorpe’s second wife and so only appears towards the end of the torrid, tragic tale. “It’s hard to turn up in a guest role on any drama,” Davies says. “Everyone else knows each other, and the production found its rhythm long before you arrived. And it’s even harder when there are lions roaming, when you’re got a star like Hugh Grant giving the performance of his life. So to watch Monica fit into that, carve her own space and find her own voice while harmonising with everyone else’s was an absolute joy. And God, she works hard. We had those scripts ready months in advance and she spent all that time analysing every detail. Watching footage of Marion Thorpe online. Asking me questions, questions, questions.”Now Dolan is about to join the cast of ITV’s Vanity Fair, again towards the end of its run. She is mesmerising as Mrs O’Dowd, a comedy character in Thackeray’s novel that she imbues with humanity and depth. So where does Dolan begin with a character? When she is telling the story, where does she start?The short answer is: with research. Lots of it. And according to Dolan, there are two parts to this. “There’s researching the script, which is very, very important,” she explains. “When you read a script, sometimes you find a line and think, ‘That’s completely inconsistent with the rest of it.’ The first instinct is usually to ask for it to be cut because you think, ‘No, that doesn’t fit in with my idea of the character.’ But quite often, I find that that’s the key to the character. The inconsistency. And everything else around it is hiding that. Because we all construct ourselves for the world, don’t we?”Then there’s finding out about the character themselves. Which hospital they were born in, perhaps, and where their parents were from.“I like playing real people,” she says, when I compare being an actor to being a detective or psychologist. “I’m interested in how different people tick. Quite often, after playing something good, or someone interesting, I feel ‘added to’.”“When I was playing the Queen Mother years ago, there was quite a lot of footage of Wallis Simpson,” she recalls. “You could look at her and you see where she’s looking or who she’s interested in. Is she looking at the man she loves, or is she looking at the people looking at her? And that gives you clues of how they might behave in private as well.”Even now, with the obvious sensitivities surrounding the Cromwell Street murders, Dolan is careful as to what she says about playing Rosemary, pirouetting with the precision of a prima ballerina in a minefield, clearly wary of anything she says being misconstrued as sympathy for the killer. So we talk about damaged people and the damage they do, and the difference between evil deeds and the desperately unhappy people who commit them. It’s worth noting that in her Bafta acceptance speech, Dolan drew attention to the fact that many of the Wests’ victims weren’t even reported missing. “I’d like to live in a world where everyone is missed,” she said.As well as research, Dolan says you shouldn’t underestimate the importance of hair, makeup and costume in the creation of a character. And she tells a story about trying to find the right pair of glasses for her rendering of Rosemary West.“Myself and Stephen Noble, the costume designer, went through lots of glasses and we got it down to two. I could see that he had a lot of work to do elsewhere and I said: ‘I’m really sorry, Stephen. Please don’t hate me, but I think the reason why we can’t choose between these two is because neither of them is right.’Even when she is not playing real people, Dolan’s commitment to her character is unwavering. Sarah Parish, who starred in W1A alongside Dolan, recalls how Dolan stayed Welsh for the part of Tracey “from the read-through through the entirety of the rehearsal period, the costume fittings, the makeup tests and the whole of the shoot. It wasn’t until after the shoot, when we met for a drink and she started talking in her own voice, I was like, ‘Whaaaat?’! She is absolutely incredible to watch from another actor’s point of view.”There is, of course, a paradox at the heart of Dolan’s brilliance: watching Dolan, it feels as if you are not watching Dolan at all. You are watching, are compelled by, the character she is inhabiting. The only thing that Dolan’s characters have in common is that they are completely different from each other and from her. Dolan has rightfully gained recognition for never being herself. Though she might diffidently suggest “I’ve got a face that can change quite easily with different hairstyles”, her most marvellous mechanic is that of a magician: she makes herself disappear. Dolan’s genius is that hers is a vanishing act.• Vanity Fair is on ITV on Sunday at 9pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b9a1b4100f0371ca5139d17ecb1e7588ac2655b/0_313_5326_3196/master/5326.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b14302a56e6f9a21c58d60065b093757","title":"harlem street names women new york mission","story":"As an intersection is renamed in Zora Neale Hurston’s honor, historians are fighting to preserve the Harlem black elite’s legacy so residents will be mindful of who existed before themThe building, built in 1901, housed many illustrious characters of the Harlem renaissance, the art and literary movement which reshaped the neighbourhood and radically transformed African American culture in the 1920s and 1930s. One of Graham Court’s most distinguished residents was Zora Neale Hurston, the famed chronicler of early 20th-century African American life.She lived there in the mid-1930s and this year, after an 11-year battle, the street intersection was finally named in her honor.Karen Taylor, founder and executive director of While We’re Still Here, a historical preservation society that works to document and preserve the historic homes of the Harlem black elite, remembers the tussle in the local community board over naming a major thoroughfare after the late author and anthropologist. She says that while Harlem boasts streets named after Martin Luther King Jr and Adam Clayton Powell Jr, “people may be reluctant to name a major thoroughfare after a woman, particularly a black woman”.It is an auspicious time for Taylor’s work: this year, a previously unpublished book by Hurston – Barracoon, the story of the last slave brought to the United States – became a New York Times bestseller. Taylor hopes the recent street naming will kickstart a domino effect – but commemorating black people, especially black women, across the city’s five boroughs is no easy task.Jacob Morris, president of the Harlem Historical Society, says of the newly minted Zora Neale Hurston Place: “God bless heaven. It’s serendipity. Could I have planned that in my wildest dreams? The answer is no.”For years, Morris excelled as a real estate agent working in Manhattan it wasn’t until he became dissatisfied with his son’s treatment at school – he has autism – that he started exploring advocacy work in earnest. Since 2006, he has orchestrated the commemoration of many black luminaries, including WEB DuBois, Thurgood Marshall and Paul Robeson.Tapping into his decades-long interest in history, Morris also began to study New York City’s role in the Underground Railroad, a secret network of routes and safe houses for African Americans fleeing from slavery. He applied for a federal grant and started collaborating with Richard Green of the Crown Heights Youth Collective. In 2005, they had their first success in street naming: Frederick Douglass Landing, named after the man famous for escaping from slavery and becoming the leader of an abolitionist moment.There is a complicated process to request a street sign be renamed in someone’s honor: after obtaining 200 signatures for the petition and the approval of the local community board, the proposal is passed to the city council and mayor for approval.Early in Morris’s activism, a young black woman on the community board told Morris that she would not approve his initiatives unless he included black women. He has been eternally grateful she corrected his oversight.The first New York City place renaming in honor of a black woman was just 25 years ago: Mary McLeod Bethune, who was a maverick educator and government official involved in the civil and women’s rights movements in the 20th century. A group of local second-grade students were studying Harlem’s history and one black boy asked why there weren’t any streets named after black women. The students successfully petitioned to have a street named after Bethune.“By the 1990s, feminist historians were challenging male-dominated historical narratives and more women were also entering local politics. It’s at this time that we begin to see more city streets named in honor of African American women.”Until 2010, there were over 100 places named after black people across the city, but less than 15 honoring black women. In addition to Hurston, Jacob Morris is responsible for honoring A’Lelia Walker, a patron of the arts during the Harlem Renaissance and daughter of Madam CJ Walker, who was the first female self-made millionaire in America Ella Baker, a prominent civil rights activist singer Billie Holiday, and Dr Susan Smith McKinney, the first black woman to earn a medical degree in the state of New York.A’Lelia Bundles, an award-winning journalist and great-great granddaughter to Walker, is thrilled by those initiatives. “When our stories aren’t told and our contributions are ignored, the message to us and to others is that our lives don’t matter, that our lives aren’t worthy,” she says. “Never underestimate the power of a street sign or a historical marker to inspire a young person, to raise awareness of an ally and to challenge the ignorance of a bigot.”On a walking tour around Harlem, Morris juxtaposed the way men are commemorated in public spaces versus women. Near the corner of West 150th and Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard, there is a playground, mural and plaque dedicated to Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, a famous black tap dancer and actor whose career ned four decades.One block over, there is a granite monument standing at the entrance of a playground named after Frederick Johnson, the former trainer of Althea Gibson, who was the first person of color in tennis to win a grand slam, one of the most important tournaments of the sport, and first black woman on the cover of Sports Illustrated and Time, among other accomplishments. Yet the two tennis courts connected to the playground where Althea Gibson trained as a youth have no monuments or plaques dedicated to Gibson.Morris feels like he’s in a race against time because of gentrification. Soon, he argues, Harlem will no longer be a black majority neighborhood. These historical legacies need to be cemented now or the elements that made the neighborhood great will forever be lost.Nevertheless, Morris has more women to honor. Writer Maya Angelou is his next project. Then Jessie Fauset and Nella Larsen, two influential writers from the Harlem Renaissance.“Street naming represents a tangible manifestation of the community’s respect,” he says. He wants any and all Harlem residents, irrespective of race or gender or class, to be mindful of who existed before them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c65175a5d9c12db2ec05affe2093656eeec47b8f/0_189_5669_3402/master/5669.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8864d6a56f138638fe7a8dd41f2e6780","title":"us immigration detention facilities","story":"After harrowing journeys to the US, new arrivals are held in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions, dozens of interviews revealAll day and night they listened to the wailing of hungry children.Here, in a freezing immigration detention facility somewhere in the Rio Grande Valley of south Texas, adults and children alike were fainting from dehydration and lack of food.Sleep was almost impossible the lights were left on, they had just a thin metallic sheet to protect against the cold and there was nothing to sleep on but the hard floor.This is the account of Rafael and Kimberly Martinez, who, with their three-year-old daughter, had made the dangerous trek from their home on the Caribbean coast of Honduras to the US border to ask for political asylum.“The conditions were horrible, everything was filthy and there was no air circulating,” Kimberly Martinez told the  of the five days the family spent cooped up in one facility they – like tens of thousands before them – referred to as “la hielera”: the icebox. Her husband added: “It’s as though they wanted to drain every positive feeling out of us.”They knew, from following the news, that their ordeal of escaping gang violence back home and trekking across desert terrain at the height of summer would not end when they reached the United States.What they did not expect, though, were days of hunger, separation and verbal abuse that they said they endured at the hands of federal immigration officials.All they were given to eat, they said, were half-frozen bologna sandwiches, served at 10 in the morning, five in the afternoon and two in the morning, and single sugar cookies for their daughter. What water they were given had a strong chlorine taste – a common complaint – and upset their stomachs.The Martinezes (not their real name) were among dozens of asylum-seekers the  interviewed in the border city of McAllen recently after they secured their provisional release from federal custody – with black electronic monitors fastened tightly around their ankles – and just before they continued their journeys by bus to the homes of US-based sponsors to await court hearings on their statuses. sat in with a team of volunteer doctors and nurses administering emergency medical care and listened as family after family gave jarringly consistent accounts of what they described as grim conditions in a variety of border detention facilities – conditions that have grown only grimmer since the advent of Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policies.Officials said the allegations made by families about their experiences in detention did not equate with what they knew to be common practice and they insisted detainees were treated with dignity and respect.The “hieleras”, or iceboxes, asylum-seekers said, were overcrowded, unhygienic, and prone to outbreaks of vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory infections and other communicable diseases. Many complained about the cruelty of guards, who they said would yell at children, taunt detainees with promises of food that never materialized, and kick people who did not wake up when they were expected to.At regular intervals, day and night, the Martinezes, and many others, said guards would come banging on the walls and doors and demand that they present themselves for roll call.If they talked too loudly, or if children were crying, the guards would threaten to turn the air temperature down further. When the Martinezes gathered with fellow detainees to sing hymns and lift their spirits a little, the guards would taunt them, or ask aggressively: “Why did you bother coming here? Why didn’t you stay in your country?”“Many of these agents were Latinos, like us, but they were people without morals,” Rafael Martinez said his voice choking with tears. “There we were, caged up like animals, and they were laughing at us.”When three-year-old Jenny Martinez came down with a bad case of the flu, she and her mother were taken to a hospital where, they said, they were left waiting for hours with nowhere to sit or lie down, and no blankets, before receiving medication. Back in the detention facility, they were put in isolation and even Rafael was denied access to them.Kimberly noticed that her daughter, like many of the detainees, was growing more jaundiced by the day for lack of vitamins or fresh air or sunshine. The toilets were filthy – with no seat covers and no toilet paper – and Kimberly observed that staff members did not throw out the crinkly blankets when detainees were moved or released they simply passed them along to new arrivals.Officials at various agencies often question the reliability of such accounts and say they cannot respond to inidual cases without knowing more about the specifics than the immigrants and their lawyers, if they have them, are generally able or willing to disclose. collected the testimony of dozens of people – many interviewed directly, and others whose accounts were recorded by members of the medical team – and found broad corroboration of the types of conditions described by the Martinezes from half a dozen people or more for each of the types of tough treatment mentioned.Not all facilities were equally bad. Many of the families said their worst experiences were at facilities where they were first housed and processed after being apprehended. It was not clear from their descriptions – and from conversations with federal officials – if these “hieleras” were border patrol outposts or Ice (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detention centers.Most of the families were subsequently transferred to a building they called “la perrera” – literally, the dog pound – that appeared to correspond to the border patrol’s central processing center in McAllen, a low-slung industrial warehouse that is the largest facility of its kind in the American south-west, where they said the temperatures were warmer, the staff was kinder, they had burritos and apples instead of frozen sandwiches, and they were at last allowed to shower.The numbers of migrants landing in federal detention have been relentless since the advent of “zero tolerance” in April, as families continue to flee gang violence in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala in particular.Staff at a Catholic Charities respite center in McAllen, where released detainees are offered food, showers, fresh clothing and medical attention before they continue on their travels, said they had expected to see the numbers drop from a high of about 300 people per day in May and June – the period when parents and children were being separated as a matter of policy – to about 60 or 80, but instead they were still seeing close to 200 people being dropped at a nearby bus station each afternoon.Many migrants arrive in the United States already weak from their journeys and traumatized by violence at home.What awaits them in immigration detention facilities, though, according to civil rights lawyers and doctors who have examined them, only retraumatizes them and raises disturbing questions about the US government’s willingness to adhere to its own guidelines and to a flurry of court orders that have, over the past two years, mandated more humane treatment of those in its care.Most of the interviewees in McAllen reported being held between three and seven days. Some accounts – provided first-hand by one former detainee and secondhand by a number of others – indicated that some people are held for 10 days or more.They were not given mats to sleep on, or toothbrushes or toothpaste, despite a 2016 federal court order mandating these basic amenities.Many – particularly men – said they had not even received blankets. New litigation filed this summer, based on accounts similar to those collected by the , has prompted a federal judge in California to order the appointment of a retired immigration judge to investigate conditions in detention centers with a view to mandating further changes.Many of the complaints about immigrant detention centers predate the Trump administration.The advent of “zero tolerance” has, however, greatly increased pressure on the system, forcing federal officials to improvise solutions, and triggered an unusually large flurry of fresh litigation. Federal officials uncomfortable at the reports of mistreatment say it is very difficult to track who is doing what, especially since immigrants making the complaints do not know where exactly they were being held, or by whom.“We’re talking about so many people – border patrol, Ice, contractors, medical personnel – it’s difficult to know who is doing what,” one federal official told the  on condition of anonymity.Many immigration experts, meanwhile, say they see a disturbing new tendency on the part of the Trump administration to disregard the rules, including explicit court orders, and to discourage officials lower down the chain of command from sitting down with their critics and attempting to solve problems before they get to court.Last Thursday, for example, the administration announced it would no longer abide by a 20-year-old court settlement obliging the government to release children from detention after 20 days.“I’ve been doing work with detainees for 20 years, and the biggest change in my mind is the government’s attitude of impunity,” said Holly Cooper, a law professor at the University of California at Davis who is suing the government over the administration of psychotropic drugs to immigrant children at a juvenile detention center near Houston.“Before, I could sit down with government officials and they would at least hear me out as I strived to push the needle toward something more humane … Now there’s a total kibosh on talking to civil rights lawyers.”At the border, the upshot of these changes is a panoply of shocking experiences inflicted on families who, in many cases, have fled in terror from their homes and are betting their future on what is an increasingly long-shot chance at being granted asylum in the United States.The Martinezes left Honduras after Rafael’s father, sister and brother-in-law were killed by local gangs and word went out that they were after him too. Another Central American man interviewed by the  had a scar running across his face from a machete blow.Many interviewees described a sense of humiliation as US officials ordered them to remove their belts, shoelaces and long-sleeved shirts (all considered potential suicide risks) and pushed them into overcrowded chain-link cages.Doctors and nurses who treated the asylum seekers after their release said they saw a lot of boils and skin rashes, attributable to the lack of hygiene, and severe constipation, attributable to dehydration and poor food intake.Almost everybody who came through the clinic attended by the , run by a San Antonio-based group of volunteer doctors, nurses and social workers called Sueños sin Fronteras (Dreams without Borders), complained of flu symptoms or respiratory problems or both. Many of the ex-detainees said they had been forced to abandon their medicines – as well as clothing and other possessions – when they were released from custody.Stories of medical negligence have also circulated. An HIV-positive Guatemalan woman who came through in July told one of the Sueños sin Fronteras team she had had her medicines taken away as soon as she entered detention and was kept in isolation away from her young child for five days. A five-year-old Guatemalan girl with appendicitis went undiagnosed for days at the McAllen processing center – despite repeated entreaties for help from her mother – and almost died when the appendix ruptured.A group called Immigrant Families Together told the  that a four-year-old boy who arrived in the United States with a broken femur had been given only mild pain medication at the Texas detention facility where he was held and ended up undergoing orthopedic surgery after his release.While deaths remain relatively rare, a recent Human Rights Watch report found that more immigrants had died in detention in 2017 than in any year since 2009. It deplored evidence of “subpar and dangerous practices including unreasonable delays, poor practitioner and nursing care, and botched emergency response”.The Department of Homeland Security has continued to defend its practices in response to such public reports and also in court.A Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokeswoman said she “strongly disagrees” with the allegations presented in this piece. “The alleged incidents do not equate to what we know to be common practice at our facilities. We treat those in our custody with dignity and respect,” the CBP said."},{"url":null,"title":"hope fades posters of aung san suu kyi gather dust as image tarnishes","story":"They were meant to build on the success of the Barack Obama posters by Shepard Fairey but then came the atrocities against the Rohingya The portrait by Shepard Fairey depicts Aung San Suu Kyi haloed by a sunburst and surrounded by the phrases “Freedom to lead”, “Support human rights”, and “Democracy in Burma”. Created shortly after the street artist famously depicted Barack Obama, it went on sale in 2009 to help raise funds for rights groups petitioning Myanmar’s then-ruling generals to release her from house arrest.“At the time, Fairey’s image of Obama had really made him incredibly popular, so many people were excited that his iconic portrait of Aung San Suu Kyi would help popularise the cause of democracy and human rights in Myanmar,” says Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch (HRW).He said HRW encouraged Fairey to create the poster because staff “felt that she was an inspirational person who really stood for treating people with dignity and supporting human rights”.Nine years later, Myanmar’s military stands accused by UN investigators of genocide against Rohingya Muslims, almost a million of whom have fled the country to escape campaigns of murder, rape, and arson over the past two years. They accused Aung San Suu Kyi herself of having “contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes”.In the past year, a major British trade union, the London School of Economics, the US Holocaust Museum, Dublin and at least four UK cities have withdrawn major honours from Aung San Suu Kyi while condemning her failure to protect the Rohingya minority. Inside Myanmar, however, she remains nearly as popular as ever, seen as a bulwark against both military encroachment into politics and international condemnation.“I still have a framed copy of the portrait signed by Shepard Fairey. It was a birthday present from my wife,” says Simon Billenness, a former executive director of the US Campaign for Burma (USCB).As he was preparing for a Skype meeting with other rights activists last year, Billenness removed the portrait from his wall. “I didn’t want it seen in the background,” he says. “To me, it now represents the hopes that we projected onto Aung San Suu Kyi. The portrait is certainly not representative of her performance in power.”Another organisation that raised funds through Fairey’s poster was the Human Rights Action Center, whose founder, Jack Healey, is best known for mobilising celebrities to promote awareness of human rights issues. He tells the : “There have been no sales of the Aung San Suu Kyi poster in years. We gave most of the ones we had away for free.”At HRW, on a copy of the poster in its New York office, a staff member attached a note to the end of the phrase “Freedom to lead” saying “or not”.“Everyone who saw it immediately laughed and then wondered whether they should be crying instead,” says Robertson. “Working on human rights issues requires a sense of humour even in the worst situations, so that put-down of Aung San Suu Kyi for her failure of leadership on human rights really resonated.”The poster and the note hang in HRW’s Asia ision office, while in New York, Robertson says, “there are a couple hundred more copies gathering dust”.This reaction to Aung San Suu Kyi’s iconography is countered at home. In October 2017, shortly after Myanmar’s heaviest assault on the Rohingya began, a handful of painters gathered in a Yangon gallery to paint portraits of the leader they call “Mother Suu”. They were protesting against the removal of a different portrait of Aung San Suu Kyi from an Oxford University building a week earlier.In February, Yangon’s regional government hung a towering portrait of her at a construction site overlooking a park where political protests are commonly held, and sometimes crushed.A spokesperson for Fairey said he would be unable to comment because of scheduling constraints. When Esquire asked him in 2015 whether Barack Obama had lived up to the “Hope” poster, Fairey said: “Not even close.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a27997bf1ef277efeb62a9d047f79d20ba7073cf/0_4_3582_2150/master/3582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66d91e4e54c37da6021010bd686f3ab2","title":"syria conflict why does idlib matter and what could happen","story":"Fears of a refugee crisis and ‘killbox’ as rebels prepare for likely last stand against AssadPro-government forces are massing in Syria’s north-west for what could be a large-scale offensive on Idlib province, the last opposition stronghold in the country. The UN has warned of the “worst humanitarian catastrophe” of this century if the attack goes ahead, since there are no remaining opposition areas to which those fleeing Idlib could be evacuated.The province is central to the outcome of the war and also the fate of the broader region. As the seven-year conflict draws to a close, each participant in the war, Syrian and non-Syrian, is trying to secure their interests, many of which run through Idlib. But few of those interests align. Most are mutually exclusive.External powers trying to carve out influence in northern Syria are Russia and Iran, to whom Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, owes his successes so far, and Turkey, in whom rebel groups continue to pin their hopes. There is also what remains of a fractured anti-Assad opposition, jihadist groups and a regime desperate to claim it has won the war.Above all there at least three million people cornered in north-west Syria with nowhere to go. Many live in frugal shelters in crammed towns and villages, and some have already fled to the fields in fear of the same sort of intensive Russian-led bombardment seen elsewhere in Syria.NGOs are predicting that as many as 700,000 people could leave their homes or shelters if a major attack is launched. The vast majority are likely to be unwilling to cross back into regime-controlled territory, fearing the retribution of a government from which they have fled.Of Idlib’s three million citizens, at least 1.5 million are believed to be exiles from elsewhere in Syria, particularly areas taken in conflict by Russian, Iranian and Syrian government forces, such as Ghouta and Darraya near Damascus, Homs, east Aleppo and Deraa. After each battlefield victory, communities who have not come to terms with Syrian officials have been given safe passage to the province.As the numbers of people have mounted, fears have risen that Idlib is being set up as a killbox – a place where jihadists are mixed in with civilians to reaffirm a Syrian government narrative that the 2011 anti-Assad uprising was all about jihad in the first place. Assad’s officials have branded all those who stood against him as terrorists, and years of dehumanising language has clouded the reality of who is living in Idlib and to whom they are aligned.The vast majority of the province’s population are Syrian citizens, mostly Arabs but with significant numbers of Kurds. Civilians greatly outweigh fighters, by at least 1001 to one, according to UN estimates.Among those who have taken up arms in the province are the latest incarnation of original anti-Assad groups, reinforced by militants who have arrived from elsewhere in Syria. These groups are backed by Turkey and are in a contest for influence with the conservative Islamist group Tahrir al-Sham, which remains the strongest organisation in the area.Roughly half of the 10,000 fighters in the Islamists’ ranks are foreigners, with the al-Qaida-aligned Hurras al-Din part of the group. The dissolution of both is a key demand of Russia, which will call the shots in any offensive. Turkey has said it needs more time to force the militants to leave. Where they would go remains unclear and Ankara’s demands for a truce, made during a recent trilateral summit in Tehran, were rebuffed by Moscow.Tahrir al Sham remains the strongest group on the anti-Assad side, and the Turkish-backed Northern Front is also prominent. Both groups are well armed but are no match for the Russian air force or ageing, though effective, Syrian cannons and artillery pieces.Idlib is likely to be the last stand for those who first fought against Assad and others who have since joined the battle. The original uprising, beginning in the 2011 Arab Spring, was fed partly by a class struggle that gave rise to a protest movement, joined by nationalists, conservatives, Islamists, jihadists – who used Syria as a platform for broader ambitions – and opportunists in search of power at any cost.On the pro-Assad side are what remains of the Syrian army, among them nationalists committed to saving the country and others loyal to the Assad regime. There are also militias raised as a home guard who played increasingly prominent roles when state structures were tested as the conflict went on.Key are Russian forces, led by the air force, which saved Assad from defeat in September 2015 and have asserted control over the war ever since. While the Russians have controlled the skies, Iranian-backed militias have dominated the ground war. They were the first into east Aleppo and have been active on most battlefields. Lebanon’s Hezbollah, the most important Iranian proxy, has lost more than 1,700 fighters in Syria. Afghani, Iraqi and Yemeni fighters, as well as Iranians, have also died in large numbers.Whether Iranian-backed forces join the fight for Idlib will be key to whether the offensive is launched and how long it lasts. The Syrian opposition political bloc believes Iran is reluctant to commit the numbers it deployed earlier in the war. The Syrian army, meanwhile, is struggling to muster a large-scale fighting force that could support its heavy weapons and helicopters.The UN believes that as many as 700,000 newly displaced people would head towards the Turkish border or areas east of Idlib within 48 hours. While supplies of food and water into Idlib remain stable for now, an exodus of that scale would severely test an aid response. Turkey has said it will not let large numbers of new refugees across its now fortified border. That leaves a swathe of northern Syria it controls, known as the Euphrates Shield zone. This area is likely to be a destination for rebels looking for the last possible safe haven on Syrian soil.Ankara plans to use the Euphrates Shield area as leverage in Syria in the post-Idlib phase, but it would come under intense pressure to allow it to be used as a final refuge if and when an attack is launched. Meanwhile, it has said it will not allow Idlib province to be turned into a “lake of blood”.Owning a humanitarian catastrophe of a scale that dwarfs anything else in Syria would be a big price for Russia to pay. Syria, too, would be likely to viewed as culpable in an offensive that leads to a larger-scale loss of life than in earlier attacks. While international opinion has mostly mattered little to protagonists on both sides of the war, the scale of the potential bloodshed is galvanising outrage.It may not be enough to stop the war but it is likely to mean that fears of an imminent full-scale blitz could be misplaced. Instead, a slowly increasing rate of attacks that leads people to steadily leave rather than flee in panic could well a plan of action."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9062838da983c2d2303c2f500fae1ea61ada924/0_331_3894_2338/master/3894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=246f9973942d17cb483a3023a206b994","title":"europe eu far right democracy","story":"Not enough attention is paid to young pro-democracy, pro-EU activists. They don’t make headlines, but they matterSo, as it turns out, the far right did not swamp Sweden in Sunday’s election. Beware doom-laden forecasts about Europe: sometimes they bear less relation to reality than to the ideology of those who seek to undermine the European project, have deep qualms about it, or just\u0026nbspthink it’s going to the dogs. Loud, scary headlines make for more clicks. Polarised discourses breed oversimplification. I’m not sure I’ve always avoided it.But something else is at work in the way Europe is increasingly framed and distorted: an insidious Brexit-Trump lens is too readily slapped on to the old continent. The English-language international media play a big role in this. Taken together, they produce a “reading” of Europe in which the EU is headed for the scrapheap of history, sliding irrevocably towards a political crash in much the same way the UK and US did in 2016: a brutal, overnight departure from much of what pre-existed, and was up until then deemed secure. What’s happened to us is coming your way.This Anglosphere take on Europe comes loaded with confirmation bias, if not schadenfreude. It flourishes in digital information feedback loops. Crisscrossing the Atlantic and the Channel, it spills out of both “alt-right” and “alt-left” milieux, which can easily converge in their hostility to the European project, if for different reasons. Even among moderates it exists, cloaked in the thick layers of anxiety and confusion surrounding the Brexit negotiations, with even stalwart remainers starting to look for continental foes out to harm the UK, as a result of domestic populist pressures.In the familiar doom-and-gloom script, the far right overruns us all. Racist rioting in the eastern German city of Chemnitz is just the start: street violence will soon become the new normal (no matter that a week later, 60,000 people turned up at an antiracist concert there). Sweden’s election is just another turn of the fascist wheel (never mind that the far-right Sweden Democrats made only third place and the ruling Social Democrats, though weakened, led at the ballot box).Election after election, the continent falls prey to the worst of the worst. Demagogues thrive. Authoritarianism spreads, Viktor Orbán and Matteo Salvini its flag-bearers. The air thickens with 1930s-style hate, fear and democratic collapse. The EU falls apart.But what if the premises of this European disaster movie weren’t accurate, or even remotely likely? What if we were busy scaring ourselves rather than looking forensically at the facts in their entirety? What if we were at risk of caving in to the European “carnage” newspeak of hardline Brexiters and Trumpian ideologues, rather than taking in the many shades of grey and colour?In the US, the craziness of Trump led some to initially turn to Europe as an answer to their own despondency (Angela Merkel as “leader of the free world” or Emmanuel Macron as a global, liberal poster child). And when that didn’t fully materialise, all bets were off and an end-of-the-democratic-world narrative set in.In autumn 2017 a New Yorker visiting London said to me: “You’re French? Paris is the capital of the resistance!” I was dumbstruck. Over lunch recently in London, a colleague asked me whether I thought England might resemble something Europe is turning into – the suggestion perhaps being that antisemitic, neofascist militias would soon roam the streets of our capital cities.Take into account the difficulty and cost of regular, in-depth media coverage of Europe’s almost unfathomable patchwork of political cultures and national histories, and what you end up with is a fabric of preconceptions. Don’t get me wrong. There are brilliant British and American journalists working in Europe. But the UK and US obsession with Brexit and Trump results in coverage that depicts Europe through a navel-gazing lens.Not enough attention is being paid to pro-democracy, pro-EU networks of young, grassroots activists across Europe. They hardly make headlines, while a mindless minority trying to hound foreigners in Chemnitz does. For all the talk of Emmanuel Macron coming undone as a result of a rail strike earlier this year (remember the speculation about a repetition of Paris 1968?), he’s now working to build alliances ahead of next year’s European elections. Marine Le Pen may have Steve Bannon as a friend, but she has run into serious financial trouble as a result of her party being accused of misusing funds earmarked for aides’ salaries. The prospect of Angela Merkel’s political death was again exaggerated when she was challenged this summer by her own sister party, the CSU. Signs are, she has now come out the winner of that tussle. The German Greens are on the upsurge. Who’s shouting about that?This is not to say Europe’s problems should be minimised. It makes sense to trigger alarm bells rather than be complacent – especially when you read about a crowd screaming “National socialism, now, now, now!” somewhere in Germany. With immigration the overarching theme of Europe’s political debates, there is a logic to Macron and his allies talking about an existential moment in which just two blocs – “progressives” and “nationalists” – confront each other.But Orbán’s and Salvini’s importance can be overstated: they and their allies remain but minorities when scrutinised on the scale of a continent. Eurobarometer polls show that EU membership is highly popular, even in countries whose leaderships lambast it, such as Poland. People want Europe to do more and better, not to pull out of it altogether.Looked at from a distance, it’s tempting to simplify continental Europe. There is mental comfort in drawing patterns that supposedly apply systematically, indifferent to geography barring a few details. Just as there is a Brexit-Trump lens, there is its opposite number: a high-minded, romantic, EU-power-or-bust narrative from those who want to keep EU founding father Jean Monnet’s construct alive.I’m unashamedly part of the latter, but it’s important to be aware of the dangers of the former. As Monnet once said, ask not whether we must be optimistic or pessimistic ask whether we are determined. Getting Europe’s nuances right is hard, but that’s where solutions will surely lie."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d5643355b7d64df7778c251c35dc65601561ec9/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=19e34e15f42742a17fa459b58f8b6fd7","title":"florence hurricane path where is storm surge heading latest maps","story":"Florence could bring storm surges and heavy rain to Virginia, and North and South CarolinaHurricane Florence became a category 4 storm on Monday, sustaining winds of close to 130mph (195kmh) on its path toward the US east coast where it is forecast to make landfall on Thursday. The National Hurricane Center is warning that a life-threatening storm surge along the coast of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia is likely. Forecasters are also warning of heavy rainfall which could cause life-threatening flooding further inland.Based on historical forecasts, the NHC track forecast cone, or “cone of uncertainty”, is the probable path of the centre of a tropical cyclone. The cone increases in size over time to indicate the greater areas of uncertainty about its path. The majority of flooding from the storm surge is caused by a phenomenon known as the Coriolis effect.

Photograph: Will OliverEPAA record number of citizens from European Union member states were detained on immigration grounds and deported from Northern Ireland in 2016, the year of the Brexit referendum.UK Home Office figures obtained by Belfast-based website The Detail show 161 EU nationals were detained at Larne House, Northern Ireland’s only immigration detention centre, during 2016.The facility, about 30km north of Belfast, can hold iniduals for up to seven days before they are transferred to long-term detention centres in Scotland or England and are then deported, released on bail, or permitted to remain in the UK.Of the 161 EU citizens detained at Larne House in 2016, the Home Office indicated 92 per cent were deported or removed to their home countries, 5 per cent were bailed or placed under immigration restrictions and 3 per cent were allowed to remain in the UK.Only 15 EU nationals were held there in 2012 – the first full year for which detention data for the short-term holding facility is available. The proportion of EU citizens held at Larne House rose from one in 12 of all iniduals detained in 2014 to one in four in 2016. The most recent data available shows 69 people were detained there in the first six months of 2018.The significant increase in the detention and deportation of EU citizens in 2016 coincided with a UK government pledge to clamp down on immigration as part of its Brexit campaign. Immigration control and enforcement is not a devolved matter.The Home Office said the 2016 spike was not Brexit-related but stemmed from a rise in EU nationals with criminal records being intercepted on sea and air routes into Northern Ireland. A spokesperson told The Detail: “The 73 per cent increase in EU citizens detained in Northern Ireland in 2016 is largely down to a corresponding rise (71 per cent) that year in the number of foreign national criminals intercepted by Immigration Enforcement attempting to abuse the Common Travel Area (CTA) to avoid detection at a UK port. Brexit had no bearing whatsoever on the increase.”However, Larne House Visitor Group, a group of volunteers who offer support to people detained on immigration grounds, said reasons given by the Home Office for deportation were varied and often less than clear: “It could be a previous conviction in the EU national’s home country or for serving a short sentence for a petty crime committed in the UK. But we’ve also seen a case where a speeding ticket was being used as justification to deport an inidual and there have been other examples where iniduals faced arrest when re-entering the UK for reasons that were not entirely clear.”Home Office figures also show that the majority (77 per cent) of EU nationals detained in Northern Ireland between 2011 and mid-2018 came from three member states: Romania, Lithuania and Poland.Since July 2011, when Larne House opened, more than 4,000 people from across the globe have been detained there.Across the UK, detention rates have increased fivefold since the now prime minister, Theresa May, took the helm of the Home Office in 2010. The detention of EU citizens across the UK increased from 1,013 in 2010 to 5,319 in 2017."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

It\u0027s not required, so a parent can either give consent for us to use that as a disciplinary measure, or they can deny consent.He added that he expected the punishment to serve as a deterrent.The policy specifies that the paddle will be no more than 24 inches in length, six inches in width and three-quarters of an inch in thickness.Smacking ban legislation tabled at HolyroodA maximum of three licks will be applied.The student will be taken to an office behind closed doors,” it continues. “The student will place their hands on their knees or piece of furniture and will be struck on the buttocks with a paddle.The legality of corporal punishment was tested at the Supreme Court which ruled in 1977 that the practice was constitutional.That left states to choose their own policy. New Mexico was the most recent state to ban the beating of children in schools, enacting legislation in 2011.A federal study in 2014 found that one child is hit in public school an average of every 30 seconds somewhere in the United States.Some school districts set strict standards, banning bodily injury, for example, while others do not.EU votes overwhelmingly to take action against Hungary for undermining democratic normsUK\u0026#39s first electric bicycle death as female pedestrian dies in hospital after \u0026#39hit-and-run\u0026#39Princess Eugenie to marry Jack Brooksbank: Date, details and latest news about 2018\u0026#39s second Royal weddingThieves in Hyderabad busted after stealing tiffin box worth £2 million and eating from it\u0026#39A no deal Brexit could easily lead to us not leaving at all\u0026#39: William Hague responds to reader questionsFuture of Europe: EU\u0026#39s liberals are losing their grip in the struggle to solve its migration crisisComment: How Theresa May can avoid a Brexit bloodbath in seven simple steps cartoonist Bob Moran gives his view on the Serena Williams \u0026#39racist\u0026#39 caricature\u0026#39Open revolt\u0026#39: Theresa May to face Brexiteer coup \u0026#39within days\u0026#39Vladimir Putin says Salisbury poison suspects are Russian \u0026#39civilians\u0026#39 and hopes they will \u0026#39tell their story\u0026#39Who could be the next Tory leader if Theresa May is ousted?

These are from a crop that includes the names Callum, Deirdre, Kevin Violet and Tristan.It is the fourth year that the Met Office and Met Eireann have run the Name our Storms scheme, which aims to raise awareness of severe weather before it hits, and mimics the system used by the US National Hurricane Centre in the 1970s.The selection of Idris follows a year in which the actor, famous for his roles in The Wire and Luther, directed his first film, became engaged to his girlfriend and stepped into the DJ booth at the afterparty of Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle.The actor sparked fevered speculation that he had been offered the role of James Bond in August after he posted the cryptic tweet: My name\u0027s Elba, Idris Elba.However, he later sought to dampen speculation he would become the first black 007, and is currently second favourite behind Tom Hardy with most bookmakers.Storm Emma helped bring severe wintry weather to much of the country in MarchThe new Met Office list is notable for its size, being more than double the length of that announced this time last year, since when there have been ten named events, starting with Storm Aileen which struck on September 12, and culminating in Storm Hector, which occured on June 13.The system of naming what critics have described as “winter gales” has been controversial, particularly when whether that was not deemed severe was named and visa versa. But Derrick Ryall, head of public weather services at the Met Office, said: Naming storms has been proved to raise awareness of severe weather in the UK, providing a consistent message to the public and crucially prompting people to take action to prevent harm to themselves or to their property.Evelyn Cusack, head of forecasting at Met Eireann, said: The last 12 months have seen some extreme weather around the globe as well as here at home. While it is too early to say whether the coming winter will be a stormy one or a quiet one we are prepared with a whole new set of 21 names for whatever nature may throw at us.As before, Met Eireann forecasters will work in close co-operation with our colleagues from the Met Office in the UK to keep all the peoples of these islands warned of impending severe weather.Please review our commenting policyUK\u0026#39s first electric bicycle death as female pedestrian dies in hospital after \u0026#39hit-and-run\u0026#39Princess Eugenie to marry Jack Brooksbank: Date, details and latest news about 2018\u0026#39s second Royal weddingThieves in Hyderabad busted after stealing tiffin box worth £2 million and eating from it\u0026#39A no deal Brexit could easily lead to us not leaving at all\u0026#39: William Hague responds to reader questionsFuture of Europe: EU\u0026#39s liberals are losing their grip in the struggle to solve its migration crisisComment: How Theresa May can avoid a Brexit bloodbath in seven simple steps cartoonist Bob Moran gives his view on the Serena Williams \u0026#39racist\u0026#39 caricature\u0026#39Open revolt\u0026#39: Theresa May to face Brexiteer coup \u0026#39within days\u0026#39Vladimir Putin says Salisbury poison suspects are Russian \u0026#39civilians\u0026#39 and hopes they will \u0026#39tell their story\u0026#39Who could be the next Tory leader if Theresa May is ousted?

One of them will be much larger – probably the biggest display that Apple has ever put in a phone –\u0026nbspwhile another will give access to the iPhone X\u0027s design at a relatively cheaper price.Many details about that new phone, including its shiny gold colour, has already been accidentally leaked by Apple.But it might not be the iPhone that is actually the most interesting thing revealed at the event. Lots more is expected, too, including huge updates to the Apple Watch and long-awaited new accessories.That new Apple Watch was also leaked during the event, and shows the first re-design of the wearable since it was released.Despite all that, the most interesting thing could be what Apple\u0026nbspdoesn\u0027t\u0026nbspsay during the event. Plenty of rumours are swirling around the company that it has yet to address, and perhaps the most important thing will be the ways that it continues to do so.The Apple Store is DOWN. You won\u0027t be able to buy anything for the next eight hours or so, at which point it will come back online – with all the new phones and everything else there.New pictures of the Sim trays from the upcoming phones have been revealed, showing the colours that they might come in. And they look... a little strange?Here\u0027s a little more on that super expensive iPhone – which could be made even more expensive as a result of Donald Trump.The iPhone XS Max might be the most interesting part of the new line-up, at least if you\u0027re in the market for showing off.\u0026nbspFirst, it will literally be the biggest phone Apple has ever made, or at least the biggest display. It\u0027s rumoured to be 6.5-inches – by comparison, the current Plus-sized phones are a mere 5.5-inches.\u0026nbspBut it might also be the most expensive phone that it has ever made, too. The iPhone X already took that record when it breached the £999 mark last year it makes sense that this is the new normal, and that the price is likely to stay the same. If that\u0027s the case then the bigger phone will also be more expensive: could the one with more memory be the first to cost over £1,500?Just over a day to go now, and the leaks continue to flow. Here\u0027s the latest suggestion: the iPhone 9 (that is, the cheaper and middle-sized version) might be short in supply, at least at first. But it\u0027s still probably going to be the one most people buy.\u0026nbspRead the full report here.Please allow a moment for the live blog to load.Apple is unveiling not just one iPhone, but three – including the biggest and most expensive one ever.

Anything you want to publish will need to first be approved by these filters, perfectly legal content like parodies \u0026amp memes will be caught in the crosshairs, she wrote on Twitter.Article 11 introduces a so-called link tax. That will mean that companies like Google and Facebook could have to pay news organisations to use their headlines on their sites, for instance, which campaigners claim could undermine some of the most central technologies of the internet.All of the rules have received sustained critiicsm from both the big technology platforms as well as internet campaigners. But they have been supported by the big companies in the media industries, as well as some of their biggest stars including musicians like Paul McCartney.But some musicians argued that the rules could actually hurt their industry, by stifling the ability to collaborate.Musicians and artists thrive when they collaborate and share, said Wyclef Jean, who is in Strasbourg arguing against the rules.\u0026nbspI’ve worked with so many young artists – the future – who have sampled my music and succeeded. Upload filters or anything else that restricts this will stop artists from making and creating the future.The rules will now progress through the rest of the legislative process, which will include a final vote in January, which is likely to see the rules passed. EU members will then choose how to enforce the directive in their own laws.The new version of the rules included hundreds of changes that have been made since the parliament rejected them in July, such as allowing exemptions for the very smallest tech companies. But campaigners argue the substance of the new directive is the same, including the parts referred to as a link tax and the controversial automated filters.Apple is unveiling not just one iPhone, but three – including the biggest and most expensive one ever.

With the gang having grappled with the devilishly difficult showstopper (korovai, a traditional bread in Eastern Europe that’s mainly associated with weddings), we look back at all the talking points from the episode.Terry, the comeback kid?Terry has been this year’s most inconsistent contestant so far. One minute, the wonderfully moustachioed man will be struggling with Chelsea buns that he’s forgotten to fill with sugar the next, he’s brimming with confidence as he takes home the technical challenge trophy. Come the showstopper, the 56-year-old was fumbling around, his bread painfully stuck to the tin. Will his next bake be another impressionist masterpiece redolent of his first week glory?

Although monkeypox is much milder, it can be fatal.The virus is mostly transmitted to people from wild animals such as primates but can spread from human to human.The fatality rate is between 1 per cent and 10 per cent.Initial symptoms include fever, headache, aching muscles, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.A rash can also develop, usually starting on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. It eventually forms a scab that falls off.Dr Mike Beadsworth, clinical director of the Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit at the Royal Liverpool\u0026nbspUniversity Hospital, said: “We are treating a patient who has tested positive for monkeypox.“The patient is being cared for on our specialist infectious and tropical diseases unit, by highly trained staff who are experienced in dealing with a variety of infectious diseases.”Over the weekend it was reported that a Nigerian citizen staying at a naval base in Cornwall had been diagnosed with the first ever case of monkeypox in England and PHE was trying to trace other people who may have shared their flight as a precaution. The first case, believed to be a\u0026nbspnaval officer, is being treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London.The disease, which was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has mostly been spread on the\u0026nbspAfrican\u0026nbspcontinent through the handling of infected monkeys, Gambian giant rats and squirrels, with rodents being the most likely source of the virus.Eating inadequately cooked meat from infected animals is another possible risk factor, according to the World Health Organisation.Healthcare staff or people who may have come into contact with either infected person\u0026nbspshould contact PHE\u0026nbspfor health advice.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"iphone launch live updates new event apple xs x watch ipad latest specs stream","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe IndependentiPhone and Apple Watch apparently leakedEverything to expect at Apple\u0027s big eventWhy\u0026nbspthe iPhone will be the least interesting part of the eventAnd\u0026nbspwhy the most interesting things might not be there at alliPhone launch – live updates: Apple announces latest developments as new handset and other products release date arrivesApple is about to hold its biggest event of the year.The company is going to unveil not just one new version of the iPhone X, but three.

With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece is\u0026nbspquite right to probe the possibility of bringing the\u0026nbsptreasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens. The sculptures’ future must be assessed for the good of the world. The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the Conservative Party, and they must not be reduced to a cheap chip in the chaotic poker game of Brexit.Dr Dominic Selwood is a historian and barrister.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system.

The different types of genetic data they obtained seemed to match very distinct groups of people within the cemetery.Those buried in their finery, surrounded by extravagant grave goods likes swords and shields for men and jewellery for women had genetic\u0026nbspancestry commonly found in modern northern and central Europeans.Meanwhile, those bodies buried without masses of grave goods had genomes that more closely resembled southern Europeans.“This appears to suggest that these particular communities contained a mix of iniduals with different genetic backgrounds, that they were aware of these differences, and that it likely influenced their social identity,” said Professor Patrick Geary of the Institute for Advanced Study, one of the paper’s senior authors.The discovery of these two different groups appears to confirm the theory that the Longobards migrated to the region from central or northern Europe – while the southern population were probably local residents.“Our current results are consistent with the idea of barbarians migrating from north of Danube and east of the Rhine, which would suggest we are observing the invasions previously described by the Romans,” said Dr Krishna Veeramah, a geneticist at Stony Brook University.“It is also likely that social organisation was based around large high-status male biological kinship groups, and these were key to establishing communities following the migration into Italy.”Their analysis found evidence of family relationships stretching back generations, with related iniduals buried together in groups.“It looks like both these cemeteries organised themselves around one or two large groups of biologically related kin, with the vast majority of these iniduals being men,” said Dr Veeramah.Having established a team that covers many disciplines, the researchers want to use their skills to investigate more ancient burial sites and learn about family and social structures from the distant past.“There are thousands of medieval cemeteries out there for us to look at. This is hopefully just the beginning of our work,” said Professor Geary.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/10/09/tesco.jpg","title":"tesco discount shop store lidl aldi new supermarket launch","story":"Created with Sketch.In July the company advertised for staff for a ‘new store format’\u0026nbspin CambridgeshireClick to followThe IndependentSupermarket has had 10 consecutive quarters of sales growthSpeculation is mounting that Tesco will launch a new discount store to compete with rivals\u0026nbspAldi and Lidl.\u0026nbspThe UK’s biggest retailer said it would be “sharing some exciting news” on 19 September at its site at Chatteris in Cambridgeshire.\u0026nbspNo further details were provided but in July the company advertised for staff for a “new store format” in Chatteris, seeking to recruit retail assistants, retail customer service assistants and retail managers.Jamie Oliver is the new face of TescoShopper claims Tesco security guard threw him out for being overweightTesco could open new discount chain in weeks to battle Aldi and LidlCan Tesco’s discounter Jack’s succeed where others have failed?

It is also subject to allegations of corruption relating to the alleged misspending EU funds by Mr Orban’s friends and family, while the prime minister himself\u0026nbsphas described refugees as “Muslim invaders” and been accused of being deeply Islamophobic.\u0026nbspTory sources said their MEPs would oppose the process because they see it as “politicised” and that they believe the wrong approach is being taken. They say their MEPs’ decision is not a comment on the situation in Hungary.Labour branded the decision “disgraceful”, arguing that Mr Orban’s “record on political freedom, equality and human rights, Islamophobia and antisemitism, shames Europe”.The Conservatives’ votes may prove decisive, as it is unclear whether the motion will pass: though a majority of all MEPs are expected to back the motion on Wednesday, it requires an enhanced two-thirds majority of votes to be successful.Mr Orban travelled to Strasbourg on Tuesday to make his government’s case in a debate in the European parliament. The highest sanction under the process, if it is seen through to it conclusion, would be stripping Hungary of its voting rights European Council level a similar procedure is underway against Poland, which has been accused of undermining the independence of its judiciary.It is absolutely disgraceful that the Conservatives would even consider propping up\u0026nbspViktor\u0026nbspOrban’s\u0026nbspFidesz\u0026nbspgovernmentThe vote was triggered after the European parliament’s home affairs committee voted by 37 to 19 in favour of a report backing the censure motion. The Conservative MEP on the committee also voted against the plan then, joining with continental far-right parties including the French Front National, Austria’s Freedom Party\u0026nbspand Sweden Democrats.Asked about the vote, Conservative home affairs spokesman Dan Dalton said: “This report crosses a boundary by politicising what should be a purely legal matter.“If the EU’s treaties have been breached by any member state, it is for the European Commission to build a legal case against it. MEPs have no role to play in the process and their involvement leaves any subsequent legal action open to the accusation that it is politically motivated.“This report is misguided, counterproductive and sets a dangerous precedent. I hope parliament votes against.”World news in picturesAn Indian man makes his way through floodwaters from the overflowing Panchanai River in Siliguri.

Persons\u0026nbsplocated within these areas should take all necessary actions to\u0026nbspprotect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.\u0026nbspPromptly follow evacuation and other\u0026nbspinstructions from local officials.\u0026nbspThose warnings are in place for Edisto Beach, South Carolina, to South Santee River, and from North of Duck, North Carolina, to that state\u0027s border with Virginia.\u0026nbspThe body also appeared to have updated the amount of rain it estimated Florence would dump on the eastern seaboard, suggesting the maximum amount in isolated areas would be 40in, up from 35in - meaning more than a metre of rain.\u0026nbspA further update is expected in another three hours\u0027 time.The NHC\u0027s latest advisory notice has been released. A few quick details:\u0026nbsp•\u0026nbspFlorence remains a Category 4 storm• Maximum sustained winds of 130mph, down from 140• Strengthening still predicted throughout tonight• Breadth of hurricane-force winds is now 75 miles from centre, up from 60 miles• Florence will make landfall as an extremely dangerous major hurricane\u0026nbspMore shortlyThe National Hurricane Centre\u0027s latest update on Hurricane Florence is expected a little under half an hour.Our travel correspondent Simon Calder has examined what implications Hurricanes Isaac and Florence have for people voyaging to, from, or around the US East Coast and the Caribbean.\u0026nbspCaitie Sweeney of Myrtle Beach texts her family while visiting the beach ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Florence (Reuters)\u0026nbspSummer vacation and rental properties sit vulnerable beside the ocean, in Buxton, North Carolina (AP, File photo)\u0026nbspWe\u0027re as ready as we can be, the mayor of Wilmington, North Carolina, has said of hurricane preparations in his city - which is likely to take a direct hit from Florence.\u0026nbspWilmington is one of the areas people have been told to evacuate before the Category 4 storm strikes on Thursday.\u0026nbspBill Saffo added, in an interview with CNN: The thing that I want to make sure that citizens know is that once this storm is upon us, we\u0027re not going to be able to send emergency personnel out to save you or to help you.\u0026nbspYou have to heed those warnings to get out of harm\u0027s way.\u0026nbspDespite all that, 65-year-old Liz Browning Fox plans to ride the storm out in the Outer Banks village of Buxton, North Carolina, despite a mandatory evacuation order. Her 88-year-old mother refused to evacuate and will stay with her.Everyone who is staying here is either a real old timer, someone who doesn\u0027t know where would be better, or someone involved in emergency operations one way or another, said Fox.\u0026nbspBuxton lies on a tiny island about 180 miles north-east of Wilmington.High tides from Hurricane Hazel cause devastation in this 1954 image from Swansboro, North Carolina\u0026nbspIn September 1999, Hurricane Floyd came ashore near Cape Fear as a Category 2 storm that dumped about 2 feet of water on a region already soaked days earlier by Hurricane Dennis.\u0026nbspThe result was the worst natural disaster in state history, a flood that killed dozens of people and left whole towns underwater, their residents stranded on rooftops.The bloated carcasses of hundreds of thousands of pigs, chickens and other drowned livestock bobbed in a nose-stinging soup of fecal matter, pesticides, fertilizer and gasoline so toxic that fish flopped helplessly on the surface to escape it.Florence is forecast to make landfall in the same region as a much stronger storm.\u0026nbspSeveral nuclear power plants also lie in the storm\u0027s path, though\u0026nbspoperators plan to shut them down at least two hours before hurricane-force winds arrive.\u0026nbspAdditional reporting by APVia the Associated Press, one example of how the mass evacuation as affected basic supplies:\u0026nbspMichelle Stober loaded up valuables on Tuesday at her home on Wrightsville Beach to take back to her primary residence in Cary, North Carolina.

There’s no juices. There’s no canned goods,” Kristin Harrington said as she shopped at a Walmart supermarket in Wilmington, North Carolina, ahead of the Category 4 storm’s impending arrival.Long queues formed at service stations as thousands of motorists streamed inland to escape the storm.Fierce winds and massive waves are expected to lash the coasts of North and South Carolina and Virginia even before Florence makes landfall, and its rains will take a heavy toll for miles inland, the National Hurricane Centre\u0026nbspin Miami warned.Packing maximum sustained winds of 130mph\u0026nbsp(215kph) the storm is expected to grow stronger and larger over the next few days, the NHC said.“This storm is a monster,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said. “Even if you’ve ridden out storms before, this one is different. Don’t bet your life on riding out a monster.”“This storm is going to knock out power days into weeks. It’s going to destroy infrastructure. It’s going to destroy homes,” said Jeff Byard, an official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday: “We got A Pluses for our recent hurricane work in Texas and Florida (and did an unappreciated great job in Puerto Rico, even though an inaccessible island with very poor electricity and a totally incompetent Mayor of San Juan). We are ready for the big one that is coming!“Hurricane Florence is looking even bigger than anticipated. It will be arriving soon. FEMA, First Responders and Law Enforcement are supplied and ready. Be safe!”To hasten evacuations from coastal South Carolina, officials reversed the flow of traffic on some highways so all major roads led away from shore. Miles of traffic slowed to a crawl along the main highway along North Carolina’s Outer Banks barrier islands.The last Category 4 hurricane\u0026nbspdirectly hit North Carolina was Hazel in 1954, a devastating storm that killed 19 people and destroyed some 15,000 homes.States of emergency have been declared in\u0026nbspNorth Carolina,\u0026nbspSouth Carolina, Virginia and Maryland.​In addition to flooding the coast with wind-driven storm surges of seawater as high as 13 feet (4 m), Hurricane Florence could dump 15 to 25 inches (38 to 64 cm) of rain, with up to 35 inches (89 cm) in some spots, forecasters said.Things lost and saved: One year on from Hurricane IrmaDuring September of 2017, the Caribbean was hit by two powerful hurricanes, Irma and Maria.

It was just precious, I can still hear it in my mind how it used to sound. I would give anything if I might be able to purchase one again, a used one. It has to be very old and seasoned wood, maybe 30, 40, 50 years old. I’m going to take this one with me to the UK and have it repaired.” 81-year-old Lucia, who had lived in her home for 60 years before it was destroyed by Hurricane Irma, is looking forward to returning to her own home. “When I see the destruction and I see what I had loved so dearly I sit down and I cry. The whole roof went, the shutters, and a brand new washer that I had just bought. I lost all my dining chairs, my living room set and a lot of my clothes, but I’m not worried about that, as long as I could find something to wear. But I saved a few things, maybe some are salvageable or maybe not. My favourite thing that I lost is the deeds to my land. I hope that I will get back in the house soon, because when you get to my age you like to be by yourself.”Hurricane Irma destroyed almost everything Darrel owned, including his much-loved photo-album, but he managed to recover one of his favourite childhood toys. “This is my best friend – I have carried him with me my whole life.

Even my computer and PlayStation and all my gaming stuff was blown away, I didn’t even think to protect them.

Guards make clear that visitors are not welcome.Inside, hundreds of ethnic Uighur Muslims spend their days in a high-pressure indoctrination programme, where they are forced to listen to lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write “self-criticism” essays, according to detainees who have been released.The goal is to rid them of devotion to Islam.Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, said the police detained him for reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. After two months in a nearby camp, he and more than 30 others were ordered to renounce their past lives. Mr Muhemet said he went along but quietly seethed.“That was not a place for getting rid of extremism,” he recalled. “That was a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.”This camp outside Hotan, an ancient oasis town in the Taklamakan Desert, is one of hundreds that China has built in the past few years. It is part of a campaign of breath-taking scale and ferocity that has swept up hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims for weeks or months of what critics describe as brainwashing, usually without criminal charges.Though limited to China’s western region of Xinjiang, it is the country’s most sweeping internment programme since the Mao era – and the focus of a growing chorus of international criticism.China has sought for decades to restrict the practice of Islam and maintain an iron grip in Xinjiang, a region almost as big as Alaska where more than half the population of 24 million belongs to Muslim ethnic minority groups. Most are Uighurs, whose religion, language and culture, along with a history of independence movements and resistance to Chinese rule, have long unnerved Beijing.After a succession of violent anti-government attacks reached a peak in 2014, Xi Jinping, chief of the Communist Party, sharply escalated the crackdown, orchestrating an unforgiving drive to turn ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into loyal citizens and supporters of the party.“Xinjiang is in an active period of terrorist activities, intense struggle against separatism and painful intervention to treat this,” Mr Xi told officials, according to reports in the state news media in 2017.In addition to the mass detentions, officials have intensified the use of informers and expanded police surveillance, even installing cameras in some people’s homes.Human rights activists and experts say the campaign has traumatised Uighur society, leaving behind fractured communities and families.“Penetration of everyday life is almost really total now,” said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia\u0027s capital. “You have ethnic identity, Uighur identity in particular, being singled out as this kind of pathology.”China has categorically denied reports of abuses in Xinjiang. At a meeting of a UN panel in Geneva last month, it said it does not operate re-education camps and described the facilities in question as mild corrective institutions that provide job training.“There is no arbitrary detention,” Hu Lianhe, an official with a role in Xinjiang policy, told the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. “There is no such thing as re-education centres.”World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

Their accounts were echoed in interviews with more than a dozen Uighurs with relatives who were in the camps or had disappeared, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid government retaliation.The Times also discovered reports online written by teams of Chinese officials who were assigned to monitor families with detained relatives and a 2017 study that said officials in some parts of Xinjiang were indiscriminately sending ethnic Uighurs to the camps to meet numerical quotas.The study, by Qiu Yuanyuan, a scholar at the Xinjiang Party School, where officials are trained, warned that the detentions could backfire and fan radicalism. “Recklessly setting quantitative goals for transformation through education has been erroneously used” in some areas, she wrote. “The targeting is imprecise, and the scope has been expanding.”The Xinjiang government issued “de-radicalisation” rules in 2017 that gave vague authorisation for the camps and many counties now run several of them, according to government documents, including requests for bids from construction companies to build them.In government documents, local officials sometimes liken inmates to patients requiring isolation and emergency intervention.“Anyone infected with an ideological ‘virus’ must be swiftly sent for the ‘residential care’ of transformation-through-education classes before illness arises, a document issued by party officials in Hotan said.The number of Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities, who have been detained in the camps is unclear. Estimates range from several hundred thousand to perhaps one\u0026nbspmillion, with exiled Uighur groups say the number is even higher.China bans \u0027extremist\u0027 Islamic baby names in Muslim provinceThousands protest China\u0027s plans to demolish mosqueChina\u0027s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedInternational community silent as China continues religious crackdownChina \u0027forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol\u0027The Chinese government says it is winning a war against Islamic extremism and separatism, which it blames for attacks that have killed hundreds in recent years. Information about such violence is censored and incomplete, but incidents appear to have fallen off sharply since 2014.Still, many who have emerged from the indoctrination program say it has hardened public attitudes against Beijing.“It was of absolutely no use,” Omurbek Eli, a Kazakh businessman, said of his time held in a camp in 2017. “The outcome will be the opposite. They will become even more resistant to Chinese influence.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/08/qr-code.jpg","title":"china uighur muslims xinjiang province qr codes security crackdown hrw","story":"Created with Sketch.Officials\u0026nbspcollect\u0026nbspbiometric data including DNA and voice samples,\u0026nbspformer residents sayClick to followThe IndependentA government official scans the code outside a home in Xinjiang provinceChina is installing QR codes on the homes of the\u0026nbspUighur\u0026nbspMuslim community in order to get instant access to the personal details of people living there, according to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).\u0026nbspThe development comes as part of a mass security crackdown on\u0026nbspminorities in Xinjiang province, the charity said,\u0026nbspwhich includes arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and “forced political indoctrination”.\u0026nbspOfficials reportedly scan the “smart” doorplates with mobile devices before entering homes to monitor the inhabitants.Inside China’s ‘re-education centres’ for Uighur MuslimsChina must ‘immediately’ free Muslims from alleged camps, UN saysChina’s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedSophie Richardson, China director at HRW, said: “The Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades.“The campaign of repression in Xinjiang is a key test of whether the United Nations and concerned governments will sanction an increasingly powerful China to end this abuse.”Authorities claim the codes – which in some locales feature on every home – help with population control and delivery of services.\u0026nbsp“Starting from spring 2017, in every home where one enters there’s a QR code,” one former resident who left Xinjiang, in the far west of the country, told HRW.\u0026nbspFormer residents said authorities are also collecting biometric data, such as DNA and voice samples, when people apply for passports or ID cards,\u0026nbspor during police interrogations.\u0026nbsp“They did take our DNA samples\u0026nbspand iris scans when we applied for the passports,” a middle-aged woman who left Xinjiang last year said. “For those who can read, they read out from a paper but for those who cannot, they said, ‘You can sing a song or tell a story and we will record you’. You aren’t in a position to argue with them.”\u0026nbspShe added people were even forced to walk back and forth at\u0026nbsppolice stations so\u0026nbspofficials\u0026nbspcould record their gait.\u0026nbspThe United Nations human rights panel in August said\u0026nbspChina is believed to be holding up to one\u0026nbspmillion ethnic Uighurs in a secretive system of “internment camps” in Xinjiang, where they undergo political education.Beijing has denied such camps are for “political education”, insisting\u0026nbspinstead they are vocational training centres, part of government initiatives to bolster economic growth and social mobility in the region.China has said\u0026nbspXinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between Uighurs who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.Uighurs and other Muslims held in the camps are forbidden from using Islamic greetings, must learn Mandarin Chinese and sing propaganda songs, according to former camp detainees interviewed by HRW.People in Xinjiang with relatives living abroad in one of 26 “sensitive countries”, including Kazakhstan, Turkey and Indonesia, have reportedly been targeted by the authorities and are often held for several months, without any formal procedure.World news in picturesAn Indian man makes his way through floodwaters from the overflowing Panchanai River in Siliguri.

Project Fear predictions that thousands would lose jobs were WRONGThere are a roster of high-tech proposals to ensure customs checks can be carried out electronically with a minimum of friction.The document says: Since UK and EU standards are identical and will remain identical at the point of departure, determining equivalence after Brexit should be straightforward.The EU will be able to maintain the integrity of its internal market without erecting a hard border along its border with Northern Ireland, said the ERG paper, launched in Westminster.At the same time, the United Kingdom will be able to develop a fully independent trade policy rather than remaining a rule-taker.Brexit news: Jacob Rees-Mogg will tomorrow unveil the solution to the Irish border puzzle (Image: )The one element of \u0027alignment\u0027 necessary is the maintenance of the current Common Biosecurity Zone covering the island of Ireland, and this is not contentious.The proposals are part of a series of documents being presented by the European Research Group as an alternative to the Prime Minister\u0027s so-called Chequers proposals.Speaking at today\u0027s launch in Whitehall, Mr Rees-Mogg said: \u0026ldquoWe have been trying to answer the Irish border question from the EU\u0026rsquos point of view.\u0026ldquoI went to the meeting with the Brexit select committee to meet Monsoir Barnier last week and it was quite clear that his concern was maintaining the integrity of the single market.Brexit Irish border: Jacob Rees-Mogg said he has come up with the \u0027solution\u0027 to the Brexit deadlock (Image: EPA)\u0026ldquoAnd if we can can provide a border which is as good as the existing EU borders, then that answers that question to a reasonable test.\u0026ldquoThat is what I think is new about this paper.When asked about the potential of a leadership challenge to Theresa May over her Chequers Brexit proposal, the MP for North East Somerset said: \u0026ldquoI have long said and repeated again and again that I think the policy needs to be changed but I am supporting the person.\u0026ldquoTheresa May has enormous virtues, she\u0026rsquos a fantastically dutiful Prime Minister and she has my support \u0026ndash I just want her to change one item of policy.Former Brexit Secretary, David Davis, said: I have made very plain from when I resigned and thereafter that I think we have got a very good Prime Minister and, like Jacob, I disagree with her on one issue - this issue.She should stay in place because we need stability and we need decent government as the backdrop to what we are doing in the coming six months.The dispute over the Irish border has turned into one of the biggest obstacles to a free trade between the UK and the EU.EU Exit Secretary Dominic Raab and Brussels chief negotiator Michel Barnier were reported to have had a blazing row about the issue last week.Mr Rees-Mogg said he still supported the Prime Minister (Image: SKY)Mr Barnier has claimed that keeping Northern Ireland in the EU\u0027s customs union and single market is the only way of avoiding a hard border between the two territories.But the Prime Minister has repeatedly insisted the province cannot be treated differently to the rest of the UK.Eurosceptics claim the issue is being exploited by the EU and Remainers to try to thwart a clean break with Brussels.The Democratic Unionist Party said that the ERG proposals were positive and timely.Davis Davis said Theresa May is a very good Prime Minister (Image: SKY)Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: The paper makes clear that, in the event of a free trade deal being negotiated with the EU, there are sensible practical measures which can ensure there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.It therefore accurately reflects the fact that the border issue is no impediment to the negotiation by the UK of a comprehensive trade deal with the EU. This a position we have consistently articulated.For too long some have used the border issue, and the political process in Northern Ireland more generally, to try to mould Brexit to their way of thinking or to thwart it altogether.

remains of Helene are expected to nudge thermometers even higher brining a freakishly warm spell of weather to southern Britain.Miss Smith added: \u0026ldquoThere is a chance the southeast could turn very warm next week and this could be another effect of the remnants of Helene.\u0026ldquoAlready we expect temperatures in the region to be higher than average for the time of year due to the direction of airflow bringing warmer air in from the Atlantic.\u0026ldquoAir associated with Helene could end up being caught up with this bringing even warmer conditions.Helene, a category-2

Centre said: \u0026ldquoThere still appears to be a small window of opportunity for Helene to strengthen, during the next 12 hours or so.\u0026ldquoGlobal models show Helene either maintaining tropical storm strength or even intensifying by the end of the period, possibly due to some mid-latitude dynamic forcing influences.\u0026ldquoA turn more toward the northwest is forecast early on

the south next week.He said: \u0026ldquoThere is going to be a general increase in temperatures across parts of the country next week and this is due to the jet stream going through a phase of wild deviations due to lower solar activity.\u0026ldquoThe jet stream is currently stronger and faster than usual and is much wavier meaning it dips and sweeps across its path.\u0026ldquoWe expect it to bring a plume of air in from the south, this will have originated from Africa and the Continent, but with the addition of warm air brought in by Helene temperatures could rise very high in parts.\u0026ldquoWe would not be surprised to see 27C (80.6F) or 28C (82.4F) next week.The weather across the world is getting wilder and weirder, causing chaos, death and destruction around the

Many of them need to listen to Sir Christopher Meyer, a former Remainer who is now looking forward to a brighter future free of the EU’s iron grip.It is crucial that everybody involved in these next vital months of negotiations is genuinely ambitious about what Britain can be as a truly independent country.We have the fifth-largest economy in the world and we’re a “soft-power” titan.There might be people in Brussels who think we are doomed to failure once we leave — but there shouldn’t be any ­sitting on our side of the table.If the Government prepares us properly for a clean break over the coming months, we’ve no reason to be scared for the future. It will strengthen our hand in negotiations, too.So get on with THAT, Prime Minister.THE Russian bear is roaring, and we don’t seem ready to defend ourselves.Today a respected intelligence expert suggests our border control could have been hacked by Russian spies in the run-up to the Salisbury attack.The Prime Minister has been admirably tough with the Kremlin, even if Jeremy Corbyn and other useful idiots have attempted to undermine her and our ­national security at every turn.But there is no room for complacency.

YEEEEES!”And for what?Stacey Dooley, that’s what. Star of BBC3’s box office smash Stacey Dooley Investigates: Second Chance Sex Offenders and now Stacey Dooley investigates how many people had to Google her name on Sunday morning.She is by no means, though, the most anonymous of the new batch on the 16th series of Strictly, which was quick to remind us of its past triumphs, and equally swift to jog our memories about all the things that remain wrong with this show.Bruno Tonioli is still there, for starters. So’s Tess with those links that all seem to have passed through about ten light-entertainment BBC sub committees, where they’re vetted for any hint of spontaneity.“Swapping the radio studio for the dance studio.”“Swapping the newsroom for the ballroom.”“Ditching the cricket balls for the glitter balls.”Devotees of the show don’t care about these details, of course, and nor do floating viewers if they throw us a single high-profile comedy bone, in the Ed Balls mould, who can transform Strictly Come Dancing into the funniest show on television.Much like last year’s box-ticking frenzy, though, something has gone badly wrong with the booking process again and the class of 2018 has no maverick entertainer, just a lot of people you might vaguely recognise off the telly.Among the slightly more famous contestants there’s dance-trained Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts, Steps’ Faye Tozer, Lee Ryan out of Blue, Kate “The Silverback” Silverton, from BBC News, cricketer Graeme Swann and Susannah Constantine, who seemed to have got lost on the way to the Loose Women studio and mentioned “the menopause” before she’d even done her Mrs Overall impression in that group dance.Once through that lot, though, you’re into Stacey Dooley territory with Danny John-Jules, a Paralympian, some bloke called Charles off Casualty, who warmed the nation’s heart by referring to himself in the third person, and comedian Seann Walsh, who confirmed: “I’m not here to make anyone laugh.”A statement that should be all over Seann’s Edinburgh Fringe poster every year.The two bookings that irked me most, though, were local radio DJ Vick Hope, whose only recognisable feature is her perfume  and internet vlogger Joe Sugg, whose presence really did flag up TV’s general failure if 13million people are logging on to watch this bloke put cling film over his mate’s toilet bowl.It also told me, without much competition from The X Factor, Strictly’s got complacent and rather full of itself.The solution would seem obvious, though. Rip up the flat fee booking system, drop the salaries of the makeweights and spend the excess on a marquee booking like Richard Madeley, Prezza, Eamonn Holmes, Cherie Blair or Farage, who’d empty Britain’s streets with his jive.This is not just my opinion, obviously. Almost everyone who’s looked at this year’s Strictly line-up has concluded it’s not good enough.You can be pretty damn sure then the BBC will take the criticism on board, channel the opinions through a thousand sub-committees and conclude that, yes, unequivocally what this show needs is same sex couples.We live in nutty times.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “JFK: Remembering Jack is a book about which man?”Emma: “Pass.”Bradley Walsh: “2017, The Queen’s Sapphire Jubilee, marked how many years on the throne?”Emma: “100.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which UK Prime Minister starred in the 2003 episode of The Simpsons?”Mikayla: “Winston Churchill.”Bradley Walsh: “In the 1930s, Caroline Mikkelsen became the first woman to set foot in what continent?”Barrie: “Australia.”A CRACKING new series of Celebrity Island with Bear Grylls was immediately transformed into Fantasy Island on Sunday night, thanks to the arrival of Roxanne Pallett, who made an early promise/threat.“If someone gets stung by a jellyfish,” she claimed, earnestly, “I would wee on them.”And if they didn’t get stung? Roxanne would probably p*** on them from a great height anyway.You feared, then, for the latest selection of male celebs, James Cracknell, Anthony Ogogo, Martin Kemp, Towie’s Pete Wicks and star of The Specialist Eric Roberts, an obvious Hollywood casualty who still boasted: “I’ve been nominated for an Academy Award and three Golden Globes, and I’ve had so much fun I can’t see straight.”Yeah, can’t see straight, can’t stay awake and can’t remember anyone’s name either, so he started calling Martin Kemp “Colin”. Eric’s fantastic entertainment, though, and unlike the others has the gifts of honesty and intuition, so he was having none of Roxanne’s Penelope Pitstop routine.First she succumbed to “trench foot”. Then she was rescued from the water after her leg became dangerously entangled with the voices in her head, and finally Roxanne had to be evacuated from the island when the camp fire ignited long-buried memories of a teenage house fire.A tale of the unexpected that earned her a fond farewell from the other islanders and a muttered aside from Eric.“That story. When’s the movie coming out?”About the same time as The Specialist II.Alan Shearer: “After two defeats, Fulham have got a win and a victory.”Matt Murray: “If England had gone on and got that second goal, they’d have gone on and got it.”Neil Warnock: “The bookies are never wrong, but they weren’t right last year.”Lee Dixon: “You can sing about England’s midfield about as long as the cow’s come home.”THERE will be no more lift-exiting or corridor- charging for Keeley Hawes after BBC1’s Bodyguard killed off her Home Secretary Julia Montague on Sunday night.A revelation that may have one or two of you screaming: “Thanks for the spoiler alert,” but tough luck. The rest of us are fed up putting everything on hold for stragglers who think the world revolves around their schedule.And anyway, codes of silence should exist only for those truly great dramas, like The Sopranos or ER, which understand you have to earn the right to kill off one of your main characters and jumping that gun smacks of arrogance.As popular as it’s been, Bodyguard clearly isn’t in this bracket.It’s far too full of plot holes and box-ticking to be anywhere near Sopranos class, in fact, and Richard Madden’s Sergeant Zoolander character doesn’t begin to look capable of carrying the show on his own.Don’t, however, rule out the possibility of a last-minute redemption.If Bodyguard really is as edgy, risk-taking, different-from-the-herd and brilliant as writer Jed Mercurio seems to think, then it’ll conclude the person responsible for the explosions, death and every other misery visited on humanity wasn’t a white, middle-class man.I’m not exactly holding my breath here, though.On Friday’s This Morning, Eamonn Holmes announces: “Next, masturbation, we’re getting stuck into that.Martin Lewis is here at 10:45, Matthew Wright’s popping in at ten past 11 . . .”And if Jamie Oliver appears, we’ve got a whole studio full of them.THIS week’s winner is Kim Woodburn and Mata, from The Emperor’s New Groove.Emailed in by James McGuire.

The first night will culminate in a “festival and funfair”-themed party where 500 guests including Naomi Campbell, George Clooney and Kate Moss will ride dodgems and play on coconut shies as Robbie Williams and Ellie Goulding perform.So far, so OTT.And good for her! If Princess Eugenie wants a Big Fat Royal Wedding, she should have one. Why not get Gypsy Wedding stitcher Thelma Madine to team up with Chanel and make a £50,000, 20st, glow-in-the-dark dress?Why doesn’t Eugenie ride to the church in a giant horse-drawn orb like Katie Price or say her vows on golden Beckham-style thrones?It is beautiful Eugenie has found love — she should celebrate however she wants. But where Eugenie’s special day crosses into outrageous is in expecting the public to pay her gigantic security bill.Eugenie’s insistence on being paraded through the streets of Windsor like Marie Antoinette means security is now going to cost us, the taxpayers, an astronomical TWO MILLION POUNDS.Officers on overtime rates will be drafted in, with dozens required to search the procession route in advance.Hard-working Brits who have struggled with eight years of austerity and been exhausted by endless police cuts will bear the brunt of that extra policing so we might catch a glimpse of Eugenie sashaying past in her open-top carriage.Is this what Eugenie meant when she said in a recent interview that she wanted to “share our world” with us?There’s nothing more tasteless than asking other people to pay for your extravagant wedding.Recently a story went viral about a bridezilla called Susan who’d demanded her friends cough up towards her £47,000 bash.Yet Eugenie’s demands make small change of that. As her guests romp on dodgems and get hammered on cocktails, we’ll be hoping we don’t get stabbed or sprayed with acid on the way to the shops because there probably won’t be many cops to help us.Extreme? Maybe not when we hear — as we did last month — that a third of bobbies on the beat have been axed in the past three years, while crime has shot up.Some fed-up villagers have even started paying for their own security firms.You hear that, Eugenie? Paying for their own security!Indeed, we might ask why Eugenie’s dad, Prince Andrew, worth some £65million, isn’t dipping into his reservoir of cash to pay the security bill?It is he who is apparently so keen for Eugenie to make a carriage-drawn arrival at church. Just as Andrew was adamant his daughters should retain Princess status in the face of Prince Charles’ worthy attempts to slim down the monarchy.Perhaps Eugenie’s groom Jack Brooksbank — the great-grandson of Sir John Spencer Coke, the son of the 2nd Earl of Leicester — might stump up some cash?Or Eugenie herself could contribute? Even if it might mean troubling her £3.6million trust funds or taking one fewer holiday this year?In an interview with Vogue Eugenie spoke with her sister Beatrice about wanting to be seen as “real”.Yet in some ways, “real” is exactly what Eugenie is. A marginal royal, she has no official royal function.She is not responsible for carrying out any royal engagements or public duties. For us, then, she does nothing.For Prince Harry, it made sense to indulge in a whistles-and-bells Royal Wedding .People like Harry, you see. Harry performs royal duties . He has served in the Forces and established the Invictus Games. An psos Mori poll this year had him and his gran — aka the Queen — as the world’s most favourite royals. For us Brits he was the favourite.But we can’t and shouldn’t roll out the platinum carpet for every minor royal who ties the knot. To do so makes a mockery of the royals’ claims they want to modernise.It reinforces the dated and offensive notion that the aristocracy are born to deserve better than us.In that Vogue interview Eugenie spoke about how she wanted her wedding to be plastic-free. How very woke.I just wish this supposedly modern royal was as conscious of social inequality as she is of the environmentOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nor commit a penny of our divorce bill without tying it to a decent deal.It would be fatal for her. Chequers looks almost dead as it is. Even if Barnier breathes life into it, many Tories are still vowing to vote it down.IT’S easy to dismiss Boris Johnson’s call for tax cuts as a ruse to distract from his personal difficulties. But he is right.The PM and her wet-blanket Chancellor have swallowed the group think about imposing new taxes to fund the NHS.Not only is it wrong, it plays into ­Corbyn’s hands. What’s the difference, voters will wonder, between Labour and the Tories if both will raise my tax?The overall burden is at a 30-year high. We should cut income tax, capital gains tax and stamp duty. It is a sure way to boost growth. Bizarrely, it can sometimes increase the sums raised.Donald Trump’s cuts to tax and regulation put rocket-boosters under US growth. We should do the same — and put more money in pockets . . .Not drain more life out of the economy.PARLIAMENT’S seats must be reformed to make elections fairer. The logic is ­unassailable. MPs must not reject it out of self-interest.It’s not a plot by the independent Boundary Commission against Brexiters. Nor is it against Labour, who ­routinely end up with more MPs than they deserve because they need fewer votes to win safe seats than the Tories.Each vote must carry the same weight.So boundaries must change and constituencies must be evened up, regardless of the upheaval — or the senior politicians inconvenienced.

He says the Government lost £46 billion in revenues because of the duty freeze. Bunkum!“What would the economy be delivering with pump prices at £1.60 a litre.”Speaking after the debate Mr Halfon told The Sun: “The Treasury themselves say that fuel duty freeze has grown the economy and offset any loss of taxes.“The Chancellor should listen to the Treasury and keep the freeze for millions of hard-pressed motorists.”The row came just a day after former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson demanded the Tories cut tax to help “strivers”.He urged the UK to mimic the US under Donald Trump – where tax cuts have been credited with kick-starting an incredible revival in the world’s biggest economy.

I couldn’t say goodbye to anyone.“They had me in a taxi and were following me, then I was dropped off in the town where the bus station is.”Harriet is now staying with her dad in Oxford while she recovers from her ordeal and says she still hasnt been contacted by Italian police.She said: “They’ve reimbursed me for my flights and the rest of my wage as if I’d finished my contract.“But I want them to recognise what went wrong and then tell me how they’re going to improve it if it happens again. Something needs to change – it’s not acceptable.“To be in a foreign country and have no support whatsoever is scary.“I’m resilient, but for someone who is already terrified of what happened, their lack of reaction would just shut them up. That can’t be allowed to happen.”Thomas Cook confirmed the alleged offender had been suspended.A spokesman told The Sun Online: “The safety and wellbeing of our customers and staff is our first priority and we have been supporting Harriet since this incident was reported, and arranged counselling for her since she returned home.”Polizia di Stato, the Italian state police, have been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000430200438.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"drinking three glasses of full fat milk a day can help you live longer study finds","story":"It can also protect against heart disease and stroke — flying in the face of current medical advice to choose skimmed instead.The researchers, from Canada’s McMaster University, looked at the diets of 130,000 adults in 21 countries over nine years.Those who consumed the most full-fat dairy  produce — an average of 3.2 servings a day — also had the lowest rates of mortality, cardiovascular disease and stroke.

but only if the EU gives way on its Irish border hardline.One Cabinet minister told The Sun: “Plan A is the EU27 show enough leg to keep Chequers alive, at least until after conference.“That’s far from clear yet, so we need a Plan B.That is, if you’re in a cul de sac the best way to get out of it is fast.”The senior minister added: “The Prime Minister will not be left stranded, so work is under way to ensure she can pivot away from Chequers quickly if she needs to after Salzburg”.The 27 EU leaders are expected to boost Mrs May with warm words in Salzburg about the Brexit divorce deal and future security partnership.But No10 aides fear they may well still give her the thumbs down on Chequers’ two key planks - the Future Customs Arrangement and single market access for good only.Cabinet minister allies are also unsure Mrs May can survive a third major change of plan on Brexit.One added: “Has the PM got the dexterity to pull off a pivot?Quite frankly, that’s not clear to me”.It has also emerged that the PM’s chief spin doctor told Brexiteers that the Chequers plan could yet change substantially during a dinner in No10 on Monday night.Wining and dining senior critics of the soft Brexit plan, Downing Street comms boss Robbie Gibb pleaded with nine Tory MPs to get behind Mrs May, hinting sweeping changes to the plans are coming.Over salmon, asparagus soup and white wine in the PM’s wood panelled dining room, MPs claim Mr Gibb told them not to “die in a ditch” as the final deal could look very different as it is still “subject to negotiations”.However allies of Mr Gibb present dispute the account.But the charm offensive backfired after Brexiteer ringleader Bernard Jenkin “lost his temper” and lashed out that the Chequers model would never work.Fellow Tory Daniel Kawczynski hit out at Mrs May’s stance that a soft Brexit was needed because of Northern Ireland, pointing to the Poland’s border with Belarus to show smuggling can be countered.And Mr Gibb’s warning there could be a second referendum if Chequers collapsed was “noisily dismissed by the whole room”, who pointed out that the PM would have to table such a vote herself and has already ruled it out.Last night eurocrats warned that expectations on the UK side of an imminent breakthrough in the talks had been overinflated.A senior EU official told The Sun: “There’s a lot of overspin about changing the mandate.The mood music here is we aren’t going to do that.“The Brits shouldn’t have illusions.The spin that Barnier will be sidelined and it’ll be much easier to make a different deal with the leaders, that’s not how the process works.“There’s a lot of overspin these days on the UK side and we have to be very cautious with all that because the disappointment will be rather big.”The official also said that British hopes a summit of EU leaders in Salzburg will change the course of the talks are misplaced.They said: “People shouldn’t expect that Salzburg will suddenly dramatically change our position or the course of the negotiations.”However, the PM was handed a rare boost by Hungarian leader Viktor Orban who said his country wants to see Britain handed a generous trade deal.He said: “We would like to have a fair Brexit because we love the British and we cooperated always well.You deserve a good deal, a fair deal.”The PM told a meeting of her Cabinet that Salzburg will be “a staging post” towards a Brexit deal.He added: “The PM said she expected EU leaders to take stock of the progress made in the negotiations on both the withdrawal and future relationship.“It will also be the first time leaders will discuss together the UK’s white paper, which put forward a series of credible and serious proposals.”Meanwhile Brexiteers stepped up their attack on the PMs plans - telling her chief of staff at a dinner in No10 that she must chuck her Chequers blueprint or face a leadership contest.One MP warned chief of staff Gavin Barwell that a leadership contest was almost certainly to be triggered as early as next month if she stuck to her current plan.Mr Barwell promised them hed give the PM a full appraisal of their views.At a separate meeting of the influential backbench European Research Group hardened their opposition to the PM.A Tory MP in the meeting said everyone in the room agreed Mrs Mays time was up.The MP told itv news: Everyone I know says she has to go, shes a disaster, this cant go on.The group of about 50 backbench Tory MPs even war-gamed a leadership contest, the MP said.The number at the ERG meeting is significant given only 48 Tory MPs are needed to trigger a no confidence vote in the leader.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They have built more houses, but not nearly enough for the extra demand the scheme created.The REAL solution is for the Government to free up land and relax planning rules to get hundreds of thousands more homes built for our booming population.That, and that alone, will help make them genuinely more affordable and get a generation on to the property ladder.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

boosting our mental health.The claims were made by Robin Murphy from the University of Oxford and Matthew Sachs from Hard University.And those who experience the sensation also tend to be in better physical health, are more creative and friendlier than those who don’t, according to the study.Participants in the study watched a 45 minute performance at a summer music festival - 55 per cent said they experienced goose bumps during it and the rest did not.The researchers then asked them about their outlook on life, how empathetic they are, perceptions of their own mental and physical health and more - before comparing the findings.Carried out to celebrate the benefits available to cardholders through Barclaycard Entertainment, the study follows previous studies which identified live music as one the biggest causes of goose bumps.Robin Murphy, associate professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University, said: “The phenomenon of goose bumps has intrigued us for many years and having the opportunity to test participants in a live setting has certainly provided some food for thought.“The results of the Barclaycard study are the first to show a correlation between different personality traits and people who experience goose bumps.“The evidence suggests that being truly connected with live entertainment and getting goose bumps, has an impact on our overall sense of well-being and mood.”The study found 66 per cent of those who experienced the shivery sensation perceived themselves to be in good emotional and physical health - 46 per cent who didn’t have them said the same.Similarly, more of those who got the tingles  claimed to feel happier after watching the performance than those who did not get them .While 80 per cent who had goose bumps described themselves as ‘empathetic’ and ‘agreeable’ compared to 63 per cent of the sample who didn’t.It also emerged more of those who got goose bumps had a stronger interest in creative activities such as baking, painting and writing.However, more of those who did NOT get goose bumps claimed to be confident than those who DID experience them -

an average of three moments per minute.And they were found to most commonly occur during the first minute of a song.Barclaycard also commissioned research of 2,000 UK adults where 77 per cent were found to have experienced goose bumps - leaving 23 per cent who NEVER have.However, those who do, experience them six times a month on average – that’s 371 occasions during their lifetime.Among the biggest causes of goose bumps were live entertainment, ‘amazing’ singing voices, guitar solos and crowds singing along together en masse.But the survey also found seven in 10 UK adults have no idea what purpose the tingly sensation serves.Daniel Mathieson, head of experiential marketing at Barclaycard, said: “Most of us can relate to experiencing goose bumps when watching live entertainment.And now we have a clear understanding of why this happens and what it means for us as individuals.“The results reflect the overwhelmingly positive impact music and live entertainment can have on our lives ranging from health and happiness to overall wellbeing.“It’s truly exciting to be part of the first ever scientific study of its kind.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433234118.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"home and garden shop the range apologises over rocking zombie child halloween display after parents complain its terrifying kids","story":"The ghoulish figure, which has no eyes, left young kids jumping out of their skin at The Range in Plymstock, near Plymouth, Devon.Mum Lisabeth Jones, 36, was shopping with for storage boxes with her children, aged two and six, when she spotted the horror show.She told Plymouth Live: I was disturbed by these models, let alone them .I’m praying it doesn’t cause them nightmares.Lisabeth complained to the customer services over the dead child exhibit, which rocks as you walk past it.In a message on a Facebook, she added: My two-year-old jumped out of his skin when one of them moved.Parents have slammed the home and garden shop over the exhibit, that also features a giant skeleton and a red clown.This is too much to be displayed in such a prominent position.Please reconsider to ensure it is child-appropriate.Other parents have taken to social media to vent their outrage at the display.One dad wrote: I have felt unable to go to the range with my children for several years in October but starting this early is a real disappointment.Clearly we can’t go shopping in The Range until November.Another parent said: This is absolutely over the top.

And who is reluctant to topple Mrs May with less than 200 days to go until Brexit?\u0027SHE HAS TO GO\u0027A handful of Tory MPs have publicly stated their discontent with Mrs May\u0027s leadership, in the wake of her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit.Andrew Bridgen, Andrea Jenkyns and Philip Davies have all submitted letters to the Conservative 1922 committee to state they have no confidence in the prime minister.If a total of 48 MPs do the same, Mrs May will face a vote of no confidence in the first step towards possibly ousting her from the Tory leadership.Nadine Dorries is also among the prime minister\u0027s fiercest critics, recently telling Sky News it is now the \"end of the road\" for Mrs May.\u0027SHE MUST CHUCK CHEQUERS\u0027The European Research Group  of Tory MPs are strident critics of the prime minister\u0027s Brexit plan and are demanding Mrs May \"chuck Chequers\".Their number include those who are also wanting Mrs May to be toppled.However, the official mantra of the ERG is that they want to \"change the policy, not the person\", meaning they are likely to continue to support Mrs May - as long as she backs down over Brexit.Sky News understands ERG chair Jacob Rees-Mogg was not present at Monday\u0027s meeting where Mrs May\u0027s leadership was discussed, even though former ERG leader Steve Baker chaired the meeting. The ERG was formed in the early 1990s amid eurosceptic anger at the Maastricht Treaty, which paved the way for the formation of the European Union out of the European Community.Current estimates of the size of the ERG membership y from between 50 to 80.Mr Baker recently claimed 80 Tory MPs would be willing to vote against Mrs May\u0027s Chequers plan in the House of Commons.The ERG is partly publicly-funded as one of parliament\u0027s \"pooled services\".MPs who are members of the ERG are allowed to claim from their staffing or office costs their payments to the group, which charges an annual membership fee of \u0026#16320,000.All the other main parties also have their own \"pooled services\" groups.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\"He recently called on Mrs May to introduce Donald Trump-style tax cuts in the UK, which fuelled speculation he is laying the ground for a leadership bid.\u0027IT\u0027S THE WORST OF ALL WORLDS\u0027Tory Remainers are also unhappy with the Chequers plan, with MPs such as Justine Greening and Johnny Mercer describing the proposals as \"the worst of all worlds\".They are less robust in their criticism and have not voiced any direct attacks on the prime ministerBut some, such as Ms Greening, have their own uncomfortable history with Mrs May having previously served in her cabinet. The ex-education secretary resigned from government at the beginning of the year after refusing the job of work and pensions secretary in a reshuffle.Ms Greening is calling for a three-way referendum on Brexit a public choice between the Chequers plan, leaving the EU with no deal, or staying in the bloc.Meanwhile, fellow former minister Nick Boles is suggesting the prime minister tries to unite Tories by signing up to a Norway-style relationship with the EU for a short period before chasing a cleaner break afterwards.\u0027ARE WE THE ONES TO REPLACE MAY?\u0027Mrs May\u0027s current ministers are bound to the Chequers deal under government collective responsibility and, therefore, are professing public loyalty to the prime minister.However, a number will no doubt be harbouring their own leadership ambitions, with Sky News being told ministers are privately confiding to backbenchers that Mrs May \"has to go\". Of those currently serving in cabinet, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Environment Secretary Michael Gove are among the bookies\u0027 favourites to be the next Tory leader.Since taking on his role at the Home Office, Mr Javid has shown little reluctance to disagree with the prime minister\u0027s stance on a number of issues.\u0027STOP THE INFIGHTING AND GET ON WITH THE JOB\u0027There are also a number of Conservative MPs and ministers who are fed up with party infighting and manoeuvring at a crucial time in the Brexit negotiations.Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Glen told Sky News on Wednesday: \"The business of government goes on, we\u0027ve got critical decisions to make in our negotiations in how to leave the EU and we\u0027re getting on with the business of government.\"I don\u0027t recognise any plots or I don\u0027t understand why people would be doing that.

The ministry encouraged firms to bid too much for the contract and failed to stress-test Virgin Trains’ plan, according to the Commons Transport Committee. It issued a scathing judgement on the latest failure of the privatised rail franchise, saying the contract flopped “because the revenue projections underpinning the Virgin Trains East Coast bid were over-optimistic and it simply ran out of money”. The report adds: “Had the Department for Transport conducted appropriate due diligence and identified the weaknesses underpinning the bid, we may not have been in this position today.” The verdict, which comes after revelations new East Cast trains will be unable to run properly in the North, triggered renewed calls to renationalise the railways, which have been hit by strikes and delays.  The Mirror told how new Azumea trains cannot deliver promised shorter journey times between Edinburgh and London because older signals and points north of York mean they can only run on diesel. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands commuters have been hit by a series of strikes on Northern Rail and South Western railway in a bitter dispute centres over whether guards should control train doors. Highlighting the flop of the East Coast franchise, Transport Committee chairwoman Lilian Greenwood said: “Naivety, over-optimistic expectations and a mismanaged bid process all played a role in the failure of this franchise – the third in little over a decade. “The Secretary of State pointed the finger at Stagecoach and Virgin for getting their bids wrong, but the Department is not blameless. “Even now, there is no concrete plan, nor time scales, for the interim operator of this franchise. The Virgin Trains East Coast franchise was a partnership between Stagecoach, which had 90%, and Virgin, which had 10%. But it ran out of money after failing to hit revenue targets. The operator was due to pay \u0026pound3.3billion to the Government over eight years from March 2015.  But the contract hit the buffers in June as revenue and passenger growth expected failed to materialise. Stagecoach says it lost \u0026pound200million. The committee accuses the Government of not finding “the right balance between the risk of franchise failure and returns they might obtain from encouraging ambitious bids”. It adds: “We recommend the department revisit its approach to franchise failure.” Services on the route were hauled back into public ownership. Nationalised operator London North Eastern Railway will run until a public-private East Coast Partnership takes responsibility for trains and track operations in 2020.  But the plan “risks adding an additional layer of complexity to this part of the network”, MPs say. Virgin Trains East Coast was the third private operator to fail to complete a contract to run East Coast services.  GNER was stripped of the route in 2007 after its parent company hit financial difficulties, while National Express withdrew in 2009. Stagecoach said in a statement it “used the same bold, ambitious and meticulous approach which delivered strong success in the past” when it drew up its bid. It added: “As the committee makes absolutely clear, there was no incentive to deliberately overbid and there was no taxpayer bailout in the unfortunate premature end to the contract.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jacob rees mogg children ambushed","story":"NewsJacob Rees Mogg and his children ambushed by \u0027class warriors\u0027 saying \u0027your daddy\u0027s a horrible person\u0027Police stood as the Old Etonian, his wife, their nanny and four of their six children were harangued by a small group crying \"daddy doesn\u0027t care!\"Share\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor11:36, 12 SEP 2018Updated11:55, 12 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/incoming/video/jacob-rees-mogg-ambushed-home-13232001,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg and his family have been ambushed by \u0027class warriors\u0027 who proclaimed your daddy\u0027s a horrible person. Police stood guard as the Old Etonian, his wife, their nanny and four of their six children were harangued by a small group outside their \u0026pound5.6m home in Westminster. A video posted last night by the Class War group shows the lead protester targeted Mr Rees-Mogg\u0027s children directly. Asking how much Mr Rees-Mogg pays his nanny, the man told the children: Daddy doesn\u0027t pay her very much! Daddy says the minimum wage doesn\u0027t count for anything! Poor Nanny Crook who looks after you and wipes your bottom, she doesn\u0027t get enough money every week - daddy doesn\u0027t care!  As the clash unfolded the nanny herself, Veronica Crook - who has worked for Mr Rees-Mogg\u0027s family for more than 50 years - appeared on the doorstep. Flanked by the Tory Brexiteer, she insisted she was very happy, Mr Rees-Mogg had been wonderful and he\u0027s got an apartment down here for me. As the lead activist accused the nanny of having Stockholm syndrome, the MP held one of his children while three more looked on in matching pastel pink outfits. The MP, who married into aristocracy and was the son of a peer, bought his five-storey, five-bedroom home a stone\u0027s throw from Parliament in January.

It comes amid claims the European Research Group , the influential body of pro-Brexit Tory MPs which Mr Rees-Mogg chairs, were last night openly discussing ways to remove Mrs May from power if she doesn’t row back on her Chequers plan. Speaking at the launch of the ERG’s plan for resolving the Northern Ireland Border issue, Mr Rees-Mogg offered the Prime Minister his support. He said Mrs May was “fantastically dutiful” and “the policy needs to change, not the person.” Former Brexit Secretary David Davis, speaking at the same event, added: “I think we’ve got a very good Prime Minister, but we disagree on one issue.”  He added: I have made very plain from when I resigned and thereafter that I think we have got a very good Prime Minister and, like Jacob, I disagree with her on one issue - this issue. She should stay in place because we need stability and we need decent government as the backdrop to what we are doing in the coming six months. Mr Rees-Mogg downplayed claims that as many as 50 of his group’s MPs were discussing Mrs May’s downfall. He said: “We are focusing on how the policy should change. The ERG is not in any way an organisation that’s involved in leadership issues.”  Mr Davis insisted there was already a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, adding: “It’s not a non-border, it’s an invisible border.” Both the EU and Britain want to avoid a so-called hard border between UK\u0027s Northern Ireland and the EU\u0027s Irish Republic because such a border could undermine a 1998 peace agreement that ended decades of sectarian conflict in the north. But it is still unclear how goods crossing between the EU and the UK in Ireland would be monitored if there is no border and if Northern Ireland, as a part of the UK, leaves both the customs union and the single market.

About 50 hard Brexiteers held a meeting last night where they thrashed out plans to eject Mrs May - with reports suggesting a coup could be launched within days. It comes amid mounting anger among Conservative backbenchers and activists at the softer Brexit bid she drew up at Chequers. That anger has mounted after EU chiefs indicated they could reach agreement with Britain on a Brexit plan within six to eight weeks. One MP who was at the meeting of the European Research Group said in a text to ITV: “Virtually the only topic of conversation for 40/50 mins was how best do we get rid of her? Comments included: ‘Everyone I know says she has to go,’ ‘she’s a disaster,’ ‘this can’t go on.’ You might think that this is usual far [sic] for us, but it’s not! Not in the mass weekly meeting, never in what’s basically a public forum.  The truly amazing thing was they spoke about it so openly, in such an unabashed way, even though they could see the whips’ sneak sitting there. Really, really detailed discussion of the mechanics of how best you game the leadership election rules. And zero dissent.” Another MP said: “It was truly mind blowing. You felt the ground opening up under your feet.” A third MP told the : “The mood in the room surprised me. It was open revolt.  We’re now in a position that if she won’t chuck Chequers then I’m afraid the party will chuck her.” But another MP at the meeting, Michael Fabricant, insisted reports of it were greatly exaggerated. He tweeted: Of the 40-50 there, only 5-6 people discussed letters to the Chairman of the 1922 and they wrote ages ago. The rest of us sat in uncomfortable silence. Though most are unhappy with Chequers. Cabinet minister Michael Gove today swung in to defend his boss as he insisted: I think she’s doing a great job at the moment.  Mr Gove said MPs should ditch loose talk of a leadership challenge which could undermine the ability to deliver Brexit, adding: I believe the proposals we have at the moment are the right proposals... I want her to carry on as Prime Minister for as long as possible. Estimates suggest 35 of the 48 letters that would be needed to trigger a no-confidence vote in the PM have been submitted to the chairman of the Tories\u0027 backbench 1922 Committee.  If that vote was triggered the rebels would then need at least 159 MPs to actually oust her - a prospect that seems unlikely. But MPs even raised leadership issues in Downing Street itself last night - during a dinner with the PM\u0027s senior aides. Backbenchers told the Prime Minister\u0027s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, his boss must chuck Chequers as he tried to persuade them to accept the plan. The flurry of activity came after ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson launched a fresh attack on the PM\u0027s Brexit plan, claiming it would be substantially worse than the status quo.  Speaking after the No 10 dinner, Tory MP Andrew Bridgen did not deny suggestions the PM would face a coup. He told ITV News: I\u0027ve been told that she will get a full appraisal of comments that were made over the dinner. Asked if there would be a coup, he replied: I think we will just have to wait and see. I hope that the Prime Minister will take on board what she\u0027s heard and chuck Chequers. Conservative Brexiteer John Baron said mysteriously: We were discussing leadership issues.   At the heart of the Chequers plan is a \u0027Facilitated Customs Arrangement\u0027. This would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. Under this plan, the UK would share a common rulebook with Brussels for goods, including agricultural and food products. Britain would also collect some, but not all, customs tariffs on the EU\u0027s behalf. This has enraged Brexiteers, who say it will keep Britain shackled to Brussels for years to come. Downing Street last night insisted Chequers was the only serious, credible and negotiable plan which is on the table that delivered Brexit while preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland. Brexiteers have suggested flying squads of customs inspectors in the province and will unveil more plans for their version of the border this morning. In July 2018, Theresa May announced a major shift to soft Brexit at Chequers - prompting Cabinet ministers David Davis and Boris Johnson to resign. The \u0027Facilitated Customs Arrangement\u0027 would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. Under this plan, the UK would share a common rulebook with Brussels for goods, including agricultural and food products. Britain would also collect some, but not all, customs tariffs on the EU\u0027s behalf. Parliament would technically keep the right to block future rules. But Tory Brexiteers were enraged, saying this olive branch will be useless in practice. Amid mass resignations, they forced Theresa May to pass a law which will make her plan illegal - unless the EU also collects tariffs on the UK\u0027s behalf. Mrs May insisted this doesn\u0027t scupper her plan. But in a major blow, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier disagreed, and said it does. Meanwhile Remainers and Labour also opposed the Chequers plan, saying it leaves Britain half-in-half-out of the EU in the worst of all worlds. That has left the plan opposed by all sides. With an October deadline looming, the UK is now ramping up plans to leave in March 2019 with no deal. But today Britain\u0027s most recent spy chief warned this could descend into violence. Robert Hannigan, who led the intelligence agency from 2014 to 2017, warned a hard border would fray around the edges of the peace process. He continued: It wouldn\u0027t suddenly bring a return to the conflict I don\u0027t think. But it would lead to poorer community relations and it would certainly lead to a rise in smuggling and historically, right through the troubles, smuggling was bad for peace because it meant a lot of money going to criminal groups who were closely allied with or became paramilitary groups. So it\u0027s a very unhealthy development. Boris Johnson broke cover amid his divorce storm yesterday to speak at an Economists for Free Trade  event of hard Brexiteers in Parliament.  It was attended by a battalion of Tory Brexit big-hitters including Jacob-Rees Mogg, former Brexit secretary David Davis and his ex-deputy Steve Baker, former party leader Iain Duncan Smith and ex-Defra Secretary Owen Paterson. The ex-minister declined to answer questions from journalists but used a Q\u0026ampA session at the end of the report launch to make a statement himself. He said leaving the EU while continuing to accept the single market legislation would expose businesses to rules that may go against their interests. That seems to me to be a particular economic risk in Chequers and makes it substantially worse than the status quo, he said. The EU’s Brexit chief Michel Barnier offered fresh hope to Theresa May this week - and fresh woe for Tory Brexiteers - by saying a deal was “possible” within six to eight weeks.

The Tory Environment Secretary had raised hopes of an outright ban in April by launching a consultation with all options on the table. But despite the \u0027call for evidence\u0027 closing in May there is still no final decision. And asked three times directly about a ban today, Mr Gove repeatedly avoided using the word ban - using the word restrict instead. It comes despite more than a million people signing petitions across Europe calling for an outright ban on the practice in the EU.  More than 380,000 sheep, 10,000 cattle and 8,000 pigs were exported alive from the UK to EU for slaughter in 2016. Government documents admit all forms of transport may have negative effects on the animal\u0027s welfare. Mr Gove was questioned about the policy on BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme. He eventually insisted a ban was still possible and all options are on the table. But asked if Britain would see an end to live exports, he replied: We\u0027re going to see restrictions on live animal exports, certainly, and we\u0027re consulting at the moment. Asked if he was minded to ban them, Mr Gove replied: I\u0027m minded to restrict them, yes. And I\u0027m looking at the evidence to see how we can take appropriate steps. We\u0027re gathering evidence at the moment and we want to make sure that we can do this in the right way.  Asked again if he was minded to ban the exports, Mr Gove replied: I\u0027m minded to take every step we can in order to ensure that we restrict animal exports and safeguard animal welfare. The interview came days after the Compassion in World Farming campaign claimed a ban was looking like a more remote possibility. The campaigners wrote: [The government] have now passed the consultation over to the Farm Animal Welfare Committee  for advice on how best to proceed. However, rather than asking the FAWC to review a possible ban, Defra have instead asked for recommendations on improving conditions during live transport.  Whilst this does not necessarily mean that live exports will continue, it is worrying that the focus is on improving conditions, rather than banning this cruel and completely unnecessary practice. Campaign spokesman James West said today: We are concerned that Mr Gove appears to be back tracking on his live export commitment. On numerous occasions, Michael Gove has spoken about how the government are considering stopping live exports for slaughter. This morning, when pressed, he repeatedly used the word ‘restrict’.

The blackened building, now wrapped in a plastic shroud, was permanently in sight of the construction team, a tragic monument to the 72 lives lost there in June last year. Nick says: “We could see the tower all the time, it was only about 400 metres away. It is a constant reminder of massive hurt for the people that live there. “I can’t think of another disaster in recent history in this country where there is such a constant and physical reminder. “But it was important we built something in the area and fulfilled our promise to the community.”  In last week’s DIY SOS on BBC One, the team created a state-of-the-art boxing gym for the young people who lost theirs in the fire. In Wednesday’s episode, they will complete a project that’s bigger than anything they’ve done before – a community centre where the people of Grenfell can go to socialise, cook, learn new skills and, crucially, have a quiet space for counselling sessions. Nick, 55, says: “It was our biggest-ever build. We did an entire street of houses in Manchester and that took 15 days. This one took 96 days. It will stay with me for the rest of my life.”  The centre will be run by the community for the community. Nick adds passionately: “If anyone ever tries to take this away from them, I will cause the most unholy stink.  “We have reassured them that this centre will always be theirs. The council aren’t going to touch it.” It was a highly emotional time for all concerned, especially when the team met Nabil Choucair, who lost six family members in the blaze: his mum Sirria, sister Nadia and her husband Bassem and their children Mierna, 13, Fatima, 11, and Zainab, three.  Fighting back tears, Nabil recalls frantically searching hospitals all over London for his missing relatives. “The days after, we were looking round from hospital to hospital. We thought they could just be unconscious,” he says. “We were always phoning and trying to find out, it was very exhausting and very hard. Not knowing where they are or had they made it to hospital or if they were still in the tower. The chances were getting slimmer and slimmer but we still had to live in that little hope that we had. It was one by one. That’s when we knew.”  Heartbreakingly, he says his own children call out for their little cousin Zainab. “But I have to tell them she’s gone to heaven,” says Nabil. “The time we spent together, I am grateful for that. It’s something that we will share, cherish. That memory that will never be forgotten.” Nabil is seen on tonight’s show being comforted by Prince William, who tells him: “I can only imagine what you and your family have had to go through. The shock is still enormous. “I hope what’s happening here is that it’s a sign a lot of people care about you and your community and want to help and this will be a lasting legacy of that support.” Then, taking Nabil’s hand, he says: “I know those are just words to you, but I want you to know that there are a lot of people who care about what’s happened in this community and want it to get better.  “I really hope it brings you some sense of solace. Stay strong.” Only Nick saw what happened next. He says: “After meeting Prince William, I saw Nabil sitting outside. He looked at me and said, ‘He really cares, doesn’t he? I really believe he does’. “And it is apparent to those families who have seen so much that Prince William is engaged in helping, and he promised he’d be back again at some stage. “I truly believe he will be. It was a really big, emotional moment on the site. It was heartbreaking to sit and talk to Nabil about losing members of his family. You just can’t even imagine.” Nick was with his DIY SOS team when the news broke of the fire at the tower, in North Kensington, West London. He says: “Someone put the TV on and we couldn’t believe what was happening. Six days later I was there on the ground, talking to people.  “Even in the days immediately after the fire, people were saying to me, ‘Are you going to build something?’. “My answer was always, ‘Yes, if there’s something worth building’. We didn’t want it to be a token effort. We spent a year on the ground talking to people about what they wanted and what was most appropriate.” They also had to reassure the community that their needs were the priority. “There was a lot of righteous anger and resentment in the air,” Nick says. “People were rightly wary when they saw our cameras. But we allowed them to guide us the whole way on what they wanted. “We couldn’t build houses as we couldn’t find the land. Then it would’ve been a case of deciding which families that hadn’t been rehoused were going to get those houses first. “So the community decided the two things they wanted were the boxing club and the community centre.” The centre was unveiled to residents around the one-year anniversary. Out of respect, its opening was a quieter affair than most DIY SOS shows.

Donna Tracey confessed to burning down her business and filing a false insurance claim after previously saying she was in bed when the fire broke out   The Liverpool Echo reports that the 46-year-old set fire to The Rake and Pikel pub in April 2017, where she had been the landlady for five years.  Days after the incident Tracey called her insurers to start a claim and they began an investigation into the fire.  She also gave an interview to The Chester Chronicle in which she said her pet dog Rhea had saved her life by barking loudly as the flames spread.  Speaking days after the fire, Tracey, who refused to be pictured, said: My dog basically saved my life.  When she woke me up barking, I kept telling her to shut up but she kept making noise and then I started to smell smoke. I opened the door and saw thick smoke everywhere. She added: That’s when I ran downstairs, it was terrifying. Nothing really feels real at the moment. “This pub is my life. It’s my home and my livelihood. I have no clue when we will be able to reopen as the inside is destroyed.  But insurers were able to access the pub’s CCTV system which clearly showed Tracey setting fire to a napkin which she then threw into a bin behind the bar. The fire caused extensive damage to the bar and ground floor and is estimated to have cost the insurers over \u0026pound200,000. The investigation also showed that some CCTV cameras had been removed from the premises with Tracey claiming that they had not been working. In her interview she told police that she had been drinking heavily for around two years after the death of her partner.

This is the fourth year the Met Office and Met \u0026Eacuteireann, the meteorological service in the Irish Republic, have jointly run the ‘Name our Storms’ scheme. First introduced in 2015, the national weather providers aim to raise awareness of severe conditions before they hit the country. For 2018 to 2019, the first storm will be ‘male’ and named Ali, while the second storm will be ‘female’ and named Bronagh. This follows the alternating male/female pattern established by the US National Hurricane Center in the 1970s.  Evelyn Cusack, Head of Forecasting at Met \u0026Eacuteireann, said: “The last 12 months have seen some extreme weather around the globe as well as here at home. While it is too early to say whether the coming winter will be a stormy one or a quiet one we are prepared with a whole new set of 21 names for whatever nature may throw at us. As before, Met \u0026Eacuteireann forecasters will work in close co-operation with our colleagues from the Met Office in the UK to keep all the peoples of these islands warned of impending severe weather. This season’s names have once again been compiled from a list of suggestions submitted by the public, choosing some of the most popular names but also selecting names that reflect the nations, culture and diversity of Britain and Ireland. As in previous years, Q, U, X, Y and Z will not be used, to comply with the international storm naming conventions.  Why do we name storms? Derrick Ryall, Head of Public Weather Services at the Met Office, said: “Naming storms has been proved to raise awareness of severe weather in the UK. This provides a consistent message to the public and crucially prompting people to take action to prevent harm to themselves or to their property.” In a recent YouGov survey, almost 80% of people questioned found giving storms a name useful for making them aware that the storm may have greater impacts than normal.

Rosanna Sanderson was 14 weeks pregnant when she suddenly died at her home on Sunday. The 22-year-old had picked out baby names and was supposed to go for a gender scan in just a few weeks.  Her devastated mum Jacqueline told the Daily Record that she\u0027s asked to find out if the baby was a boy or a girl when a post-mortem is carried out so she can get the right colour of flowers at the funeral.   The post-mortem was due to be carried out on Wednesday to find out what caused the death of the seemingly fit and healthy hairdresser from Clarkston, near Glasgow. Jacqueline, 49, said: “Her baby was due on March 8 and we were supposed to go and get the gender scan soon. She had a big balloon for the reveal. “If it was a girl, she wanted to call her Lilly, and Oscar for a boy. “I have asked them to tell us after the post-mortem if the baby was a boy or a girl because I want to get the right flowers.  “She was in her prime and said, ‘This baby is going to be the making of me’. She said, ‘This baby is going to make me feel complete’. She would’ve made the best mum ever.” Rosanna was expecting with her former partner of four years Oliver, 28. The pair were both excited to become parents. Rosanna proudly posted a picture of her 12-week baby scan on her Facebook page last month and told friends how much she was looking forward to becoming a mum. In the early hours of Sunday, she had woken up and texted her mum and spoken to Oliver on the phone. They found her dead just an hour later. Jacqueline said: “I got a message at 4.30am. She said she had been sleeping. She had spoken to Oliver and was really happy talking to him.  “She wasn’t ill but she had previously complained of pins and needles in her arms and sore legs. “Everyone was saying they couldn’t get hold of Rosanna the next morning so I went around to her house and all the curtains were closed. “I was banging on her bedroom window really loud and there was no answer so I started to panic.” Jacqueline called Oliver, who came to the house with a key and the pair went inside together. She said: “I lifted the cover off her and knew she was gone. Her fingers were blue. I threw myself on top of her and told her I loved her. “She just looked like she had been sleeping. My heart breaks for Oliver having to see that.  “All she ever wanted was to be a mum. We went for the scan on August 27. She had been really worried before it, saying, ‘Mum, what if we go there and the baby’s not there?’ “When the baby came up on the screen, she burst out crying with happiness.” Rosanna – who had no known health problems and was a cheerleader at school – was unemployed but had been helping out at the Hair Lounge in Newton Mearns at weekends. Rosanna’s sister Angelina, 27, and brother Paul, 24, have been left devastated by her death. Jacqueline said her daughter had looked on her ex-partner Gordon Milligan, known as Spike, as a father figure and his parents Mabel and Ian as grandparents. She added friends, relatives and neighbours had been pulling together to get organised for the baby and knitting clothes. Jacqueline said: “She wanted a blue or pink teddy after the gender scan with the baby’s heartbeat inside. I so wish I had that now so I could keep it forever.

I could not believe what I was seeing and started CPR - all I knew was I needed to get her little heart beating again. The paramedics arrived and suddenly we were at the hospital. There were loads of doctors frantically working on my beautiful daughter. Then I heard \u00277.12am time of death\u0027. I fell to the floor in disbelief. I thought \u0027my daughter isn\u0027t gone, this is just some bad dream\u0027. I glanced up to my lifeless daughter, tubes everywhere and machines being switched off.

Prior to her divorce to Charles in August 1996, but during their separation, Diana took a string of lovers as she broke away from the royal family. Yesterday it was revealed one of those lovers, Oliver Hoare, had died from cancer aged 73. It\u0027s thought married Oliver, a father-of-three, began an affair with Diana in 1992. He was 16 years older than the princess, and the affair ended when his wife threatened him with divorce. Oliver, a close friend of Charles, was said to have been hounded by 300 malicious calls from Princess Diana after he ended the affair. Other lovers Diana took included protection officer Barry Mannakee, rugby legend Will Carling and cavalry officer James Hewitt.  The married close protection officer was a police officer with the Royal protection Squad and bodyguard to Diana. He was eventually transferred from his role as her protection officer following what was described as an inappropriate relationship between the two. In tapes recorded by Diana\u0027s voice coach, she admitted that in 1984 through to 1986, she had been deeply in love with someone who worked in this environment. While not referring to him by name, it\u0027s believed she was speaking about Mannakee. She told friends: He was my father figure and looked after me. Mannakee, 37, died in a motorbike accident in 1987. James Gilby  Diana\u0027s friend James Gilby Affectionately gave Diana the nickname of Squidgy. He was caught speaking to her on the Squidgygate phone tapes secretly recorded in 1989. He knew the princess since before her marriage to Charles and the recorded tapes caused huge controversy around how they were obtained. It\u0027s thought Diana\u0027s relationship with James was at its peak in 1989. Will Carling   Meghan Markle and Harry\u0027s royal tour: Dates and itinerary for couple\u0027s first tour revealed  Diana and rugby legend Will Carling met at a Chelsea gym. After an affair, Diana fell out with the sportsman when their relationship was revealed in 1995. Carling, who played for England, was married at the time of the affair with the princess. His wife criticised Diana\u0027s conduct during the fallout, while the princess said he had followed her like a puppy. Hasnat Khan   Princess Diana used clever trick at the gym to try and stop photographers taking her picture  Heart surgeon Hasnat Khan had a two-year relationship with Diana, starting in 1995. She is said to have described him as Mr Wonderful and the pair even considered marriage. Diana is thought to have seen Khan as the love of her life and even visited his family in Lahore, Pakistan. The cardiologist has never sought to cash in on their relationship after her death and has never revealed intimate details of their time together. Diana is thought to have ended the relationship in June 1997.

And the millionaire Old Etonian, whose death was announced on Tuesday, always knew exactly who made them. But he tried to protect his family from learning of his affair with Diana, who made the calls after he dumped her. With his death from cancer at 73, discreet Oliver has taken the full story of their tempestuous relationship to his grave. But he never knew Diana was sitting outside his house making the calls on her mobile. One of her closest friends revealed the extraordinary truth behind the calls, which were investigated by the politan Police in 1995.  They told the Mirror: “Diana was very naughty. She would drive to his house and park up outside and then call his house phone from her mobile. “She’d do it in the middle of the night, so she could watch the lights in the house go on as he scrambled to the phone. She would be there for hours, watching and calling. “She knew she couldn’t be with Hoare, because he was married. And while he might have been a gentleman, and a very entertaining one at that, it was his wife who actually had the money. “Diana would always say, ‘I know he will never leave his wife’. But she wasn’t used to not getting her way. So she would enjoy taunting him and reminding him she was there.  “She even asked her staff to ring his house number for her. She’d say, “Ring that number and then hang up’. Of course, no one knew then what they were doing then. “Diana was playing games in the relationship, but she enjoyed it. He was playing with fire when he started dating a princess, and he should have known he could get burnt.” Now, with Oliver’s death at his home in France, other friends have recalled their tempestuous relationship. Their affair was so passion\u0026shy\u0026shyate that Diana used to dream of running away with him. And Oliver used to hide in a pal’s car boot to get smuggled into \u0026shyKensington Palace for secret trysts. On one infamous occasion Oliver, enjoying a cigar after a night of passion, triggered the fire alarm at the palace. It set off the sprinklers and staff found him naked and sheepishly hiding behind a bay tree in the garden. He was told: “Mr Hoare, I think it’s time you went home, don’t you?” But once Oliver, a wealthy art expert, had decided to dump her, Diana became the ultimate woman scorned.  Fuelled by jealousy and Oliver’s decision to stay with his wife, she launched a vitriolic series of more than 300 nuisance calls to his family home. A friend said: “These calls showed the sheer depth and intensity of their relationship. She was deeply in love with him and could not understand being dropped. Oliver was very cool, and the incident involving the post-coital cigar setting off the alarms has gone down as one of the great anecdotes.” Diana’s friend Lady Elsa Bowker once recalled that she “daydreamed of living in Italy with the handsome Hoare”. Lady Bowker, who was 92 when she died in 2000 and had no children of her own, was a second mother to Diana. She knew Diana was “infatuated” with the married dad-of-three, embarking on a passionate four-year relationship during her failing marriage to Prince Charles, which ended in divorce in August 1996. Diana’s affair with Oliver began after her father’s death in 1992. He was just one of a string of lovers she took during her marriage. They included close protection officer Barry Mannakee, heart surgeon Hasnat Khan, England rugby union captain Will Carling and lifelong friend James Gilbey. Oliver was also a close pal of Charles, who once used his house in France to recuperate after a polo accident.  He was a student at Sorbonne University in Paris, before joining Christie’s auction house and going on to become a specialist in Islamic art. Diana’s friend confirmed Oliver occasionally sneaked into the palace in a car boot, but added: “He was a gentleman, so he would have been less pleased to get in the boot than [lover] James Hewitt or Hasnat Khan. “You knew when Hoare would be coming to visit because it was one of the few times Diana would order in champagne. She didn’t drink, but she’d always get a bottle of Krug on ice for him. “They would love a quiet dinner together. They were quite boring when they got together, but Diana liked that. “She liked having someone by her side, who worshipped her. She would dream of setting up home in Italy, then she wanted a chateau in France. For a while it was America. But when she realised all his toys were paid for by his wife, she knew it would never happen.” Oliver bought Diana a gold bracelet that she kept until she died in 1997. The friend said Prince Charles knew of the affair, adding: “It was an open secret. “And Charles knew. But what could he say? He wasn’t in a position to comment.” COMMENT by Paul Burrell, Diana\u0027s former butler "},{"url":null,"title":"toby carvery refuses give throat","story":"NewsToby Carvery customer in tears after being barred from ordering a child\u0027s portion despite showing medical cardLynn Deer, 73, was diagnosed with stomach cancer in April and is unable to eat normal portions of foodShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsBySophie McCoid22:53, 11 SEP 2018Updated07:30, 12 SEP 2018NewsLynn Deer who was refused a child\u0027s portion at the Toby Carvery\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA terminally ill cancer patient was left sobbing after staff at a Toby Carvery refused to acknowledge her medical card. Lynn Deer, 73, visited the Toby Carvery at Arrowe Park with her son Marcel on Sunday - but was left stunned by a \u0027rude\u0027 member of staff. The Liverpool Echo reports that Ms Deer, who was diagnosed with stomach cancer in April, carries a medical card from the Oesophageal Patients Association which she can show discreetly to restaurant staff to avoid embarassment. The card reads: Due to a medical condition I am unable to eat normal portions of food. Please provide me with a child\u0027s size portion. But the manager at the carvery refused to look at the card - leaving Lynne devastated. She said: I\u0027ve used the card in lots of restaurants before and had absolutely no problems.  But the manager didn\u0027t want to know, she just kept saying she didn\u0027t need to see it and that only children under 12 could have a child size plate. I\u0027ve had the majority of my stomach removed, so I physically can\u0027t eat large amounts of food and it distresses me when there\u0027s a lot of food put in front of me. Me and Marcel went up to the carvery and I just had four spoonfuls of mash and gravy. I made the waitress take my plate up to the manager after I\u0027d barely touched my food and she just shrugged - I couldn\u0027t believe it.  Lynn, from Pensby, went to doctors in April with what she thought was indigestion, but was actually stomach cancer. She had an operation to remove the large tumour in her stomach and underwent chemotherapy - but sadly the chemo didn\u0027t work and Lynn is now on a palliative care plan. Lynn said: I don\u0027t know how long I\u0027ve got left, that could have been the last meal me and my son had together and it was just ruined by the manager - she was horrible. When we left the restaurant I just sobbed, it\u0027s not about the money, it was the way I was treated that was unacceptable.

Environmental groups from around the world have voiced their outrage at the proposal, and called for further protection to be given to the animals. Activists claim that in spite of the ban - which has been in place for more than three decades - endangered whales are still being slaughtered in their thousands.  The controversial move comes after widespread condemnation of continued killings by whalers from Japan, Norway and Iceland.  Last month devastating pictures showed a whale foetus being dragged away to the trash after its mother was butchered in Iceland.  Activists have branded whaling - which sees the animals harpooned at least once before they die - as unnecessarily cruel. Officials from the International Whaling Commission in Brazil will this week decide whether the ban - which has been in place since 1986 - should be lifted. Japanese delegates claim many types of whale are not endangered and can be harvested sustainably. Since the ban was brought in, the Environmental Investigation Agency  claims more than 38,500 whales have been killed by whalers from Iceland, Norway and Japan. Japan claims it hunts for dolphins in order to carry out scientific research, which is legal under the 1986 ban.  Hunted whales are impaled with a grenade-tipped harpoon and towed to the shore with a rope so they can be butchered. Critics have branded the slaughter barbaric and called for sanctions against countries which allow whaling to take place. Charity ORCA, which works to protect whales and dolphins, blasted the whalers. Head of science and conservation, Lucy Babey, said: Subjecting them to this indescribable pain and suffering can only be defined as sickening inhumanity it is quite simply heartbreaking. A statement from the EIA said: Despite the global ban, Japan, Norway and Iceland continue commercial whaling.

I think it might be good for both of us.”While Kamara has remained in Scotland this week for treatment, Kallman is off on international duty, though not with the full squad.But while, after winning his first full cap earlier this year, he appears to be dropping a level as he joins the U/21 squad for two vital Euro qualifiers, he’s happy.The 20-year-old is very much of the opinion that his near-certain involvement against Denmark and Poland will be a case of taking one step back to make two forward.The Dens loan signing from Turku doesn’t hide from the fact he would love to have competed at the higher level.For him, though, time on the park is what matters most and that’s why he’s more than happy to be representing his country in the younger age group.“Of course you always want to go forward and I heard back in Finland they were looking to put new players into the team and the manager said I was one of the options,” he said.“However, then again you have to think about that. Now I am in the U/21s and we have two qualifier games.“I’ve played with them all the time and am going to play as the first striker for them. You have to know which are the best moments to go to the first team because, if I go to the U/21s, I’ll get playing time and we have two games to try to qualify with them.“For that reason I think it might be better to be with the U/21s to get playing time. If I got called up to the first team, yes, I would be there but how much playing time will I get, I don’t know.“It’s easier to say afterwards because you don’t know how much time you will get but with the U/21s I know I am guaranteed playing time.”And the benefit to Dundee of his trip back to the continent should be the competitive nature of the action he sees.Not only are the opposition he’ll face of a decent standard, there’s plenty of stake in the fixtures.If the young Finns can win both, they would still be in with a chance of qualifying for the Euro finals, though the history of the group so far does suggest they will have their work cut out.When they faced the Danes at home last year they were on the wrong end of a 5-0 drubbing, so to beat them in the away tie will be a big ask.Kallman, though, is up for the challenge and is determined to do all his can to at least extend Finnish interest in qualification.“These will be a tough two games. They are the deciders for us because teams are four and five points ahead of us in the table with Poland first and Denmark second.“We have to at least not lose these game to still have a chance to proceed.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9637ddc723d.jpg ","title":"chrissie hynde backed after calling for monstrosity block next to dundee va to be torn down","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPretenders singer Chrisse Hynde has been backed after calling for a controversial office block next to V\u0026ampA Dundee to be \u0026#8216torn down\u0026#8217.The star said the under-construction site \u0026#8220distracted\u0026#8221 her from her performance at Slessor Gardens on Sunday.Hynde told BBC Scotland: \u0026#8220In the daylight I noticed this quite beautiful building in the background, which I didn\u0026#8217t realise is the V\u0026ampA building, and this horrible carcass going up in front of it.\u0026#8220It was actually distracting me from what I was trying to do.\u0026#8220I was walking down Union Street there and I saw the V\u0026ampA again, a really beautiful vista of it and this monstrosity that\u0026#8217s totally obliterating the view of that beautiful building.\u0026#8220I would have it torn down.

We missed two penalties and we were always in the game until the last two goals went in later in the second half.“So, I think the score was harsh on us in the end but you still don’t want to lose five goals in any game and you want to defend better.”Looking forward, he suspects Alloa will not be much changed from the side that drew with United in the Championship last weekend“I think they don’t have a massive squad so it could be similar to the league game against us on Saturday. They are a good, fit and organised outfit. It will be a hard game.”As was the case in the first-round victory over St Johnstone Colts last month, the United ranks at Tannadice on Saturday are likely to be bolstered by several first-team men.And young midfielder Archie Thomas is back in contention for a starting place.He was injured in the first minute of the first-round victory but returned for half an hour of Monday’s game.United have set the entry price for Saturday’s game at £10.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b618c05b50b5-923x564.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlos new boys are showing some promise at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt remains early days so far as judging new-look Dundee United goes but there is no question Csaba Laszlo’s team are getting to know each other.After a sticky start to the season, there have been definite signs over the last three, unbeaten, Championship outings that the team is coming together.And the Tele takes a look and how the new men have contributed, so far.Matej RakovanAfter joining up on the same day as fellow-goalie Benjamin Siegrist, one of the big questions going into the campaign was which of the pair would get the nod. It was the Slovakian and, so far, he’s justified the faith shown in him with a string of impressive performances. He did make an error for the goal lost against Partick, but by then the game had been comfortably won.Frederic FransThe Belgian was added to the squad to provide steel in central defence and the fact he had experience of the Scottish game from a spell with Partick made him a sensible addition. So far he’s lived up to expectations and looked a strong and calming influence.Paul WatsonProbably the most low key signing, at first it seemed doubtful if the man who was a squad player at Falkirk would feature too often. Given his chance at Queen of the South last month, the powerful centre-half grabbed the opportunity and impressed in each of his three league games to date, scoring three goals in the process. With the arrival of Rachid Bouhenna, he still faces a challenge to keep his place.Christoph RabitschThe Austrian has had a robust start to his United career and a couple of rash tackles when he was already on a booking have seen him subbed to prevent the team being reduced to 10 men. The 22-year-old was publicly slapped down by Csaba for that. He appears to have taken it on board and there’s no question his ability to get in about opponents is an asset.Adam BartonCaptured from Partick Thistle just before the Betfred Cup games kicked off, the tall Englishman has added to United’s new-found aerial strength. Most of his appearances so far have been in midfield, so he’ll face a challenge once skipper Fraser Fyvie returns from injury, but he’s also been used in central defence and that versatility has given the manager more options.Fraser AirdOne of the first signings of the summer, the Canadian has added pace in the wide areas. He earned his move on the strength of performances against United for Dunfermline last term and, so far, he might just have been the best of the new bunch.Yannick LoembaThe winger was an unknown quantity who hadn’t had much football in the last year or so. However, there’s been no evidence of that and he’s made a lightning start to his time with United. The 28-year-old always wants on the ball and his eagerness to get forward has made him a fans’ favourite.Pavol SafrankoThe loan signing from Aalborg marked his debut with an excellent goal in the win at Queen of the South and has looked the part since. Well-known to the manager from their time together in his native Slovakia, Safranko looks to be the centre-forward United have been crying out for.Craig CurranA dead leg picked up in pre-season delayed his involvement until the opening league game when Dunfermline won at Tannadice. As his fitness has improved after that injury, Curran has shown himself to be a hard worker and chipped in with a goal against Partick.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b978f2ccdc6c.jpg ","title":"dundee coffee house donates cash to ugandan farmers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSignpost International Dundee and Henry’s Coffee House have launched a partnership to raise funds for a good cause.Coffee That Cares will donate 20p from the cost of a flavoured latte at Henry’s this month towards supporting Ugandan coffee farmers.The shop is collaborating with the charity to train and equip farmers in improved sustainable methods.Jonathan Horne, owner of Henry’s, said: “I am delighted we have formed this new partnership with Signpost International.

The council still owns the site at the moment.“The architects and developers who lodged the application said they wouldn’t buy the land until they were given planning permission.“Ediston Real Estate put in a bid but it has been outbid by Robertson Capital, which has submitted a bid of £1.6m.“It is very likely that it will get waved through on Monday.”Discussions on the deal are to be held in private, with few details of the meeting publicly available.The plan to build 99 flats on Site 6 were approved by councillors last month following Ediston’s application. The block will sit on the north-eastern corner of the site, away from the office block currently under construction that overlooks the V\u0026ampA.A total of eight plots have been earmarked for Site 6, with a central courtyard in the middle.At last month’s planning committee, councillors disagreed over the decision not to require planners to include parking spaces at the complex for residents.Conservative West End councillor Donald Hay had attempted to stop the development but could not find a seconder to enable his motion to be put to a vote.Mr Hay said he was concerned at the number of flats being built without parking in the city centre.However, former city development chief Mike Galloway said people would be able to apply for the residents’ parking scheme, which would give them access to city centre multi-storey car parks.He added that the council could build further parking facilities in the city centre if demand was identified but there were as yet no plans to do so.The nearest car park is the Greenmarket multi-storey, a few minutes’ walk away.The city council declined to comment.The Robertson Group and Ediston Real Estate had not responded to a request for

comfortable wins over Queen of the South and Partick Thistle saw them, seemingly, turn a corner.United controlled and managed those matches well but all their good work came undone as they laboured to a point at the Indodrill Stadium at the weekend.Csaba had spoken at the start of the season about his side’s need to start grinding out results if they want to win the Championship.And his disappointment and anger was evident as they couldn’t dictate what he called a ‘dirty game’ in Clackmannanshire.“It was a dirty game but one which really, if you want to make the top league, you have to manage all the time and finish,” he said.“This is not about dominating the game, it’s about winning the game.“It is clear for us that this was an artificial pitch and even it was seven, eight yards shorter than usually.“So I wait for my team and it’s clear, in this case, you have to circulate the ball quicker, you have to move the ball out quicker to have the possibility to move up the pitch.”United had opened the scoring in the second half through a Paul Watson header on 71 minutes, his third goal in two games, and it could have been more.Yannick Loemba had what would have been his first strike for the Tangerines ruled out for offside and Csaba felt 18-year-old Declan Glass could have played in fellow-sub Callum Booth to put the game beyond doubt.As it transpired, the kid gave away possession and Alloa broke to win the free-kick which Iain Flannigan curled home on 82 minutes to earn the Wasps a point.It was no less than the home side deserved but Csaba couldn’t help scrutinise his team’s game management.“We were in front, you have just to keep the ball and keep the result,” he added.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"enterprise car hire firm plans new branch at dundee

to top nations league group","story":"\t\t\t\t\tKevin McDonald believes the Uefa Nations League has allowed Scotland to find their spirit.The former Dundee man insists the new competition, brought in to replace mid-season friendlies, has given a competitive edge to international football the Scots thrive under.Evidence of its effect on the national team came on Monday night as they ran out 2-0 winners over Albania at a rain-drenched Hampden Park.Alex McLeish’s side dominated most of the 90 minutes, with the visitors only really threatening on the break, and took control in the second half.A Berat Djimshiti own goal on 47 minutes, which many in attendance thought was a Steven Naismith goal, and one on 68 minutes which was no doubt the Hearts man’s, saw Scotland rise to the top of Group C1.And 29-year-old McDonald was delighted with the result and performance.“We dominated most of the game and never really felt under too much pressure and it was a real solid performance,” he said.“Right from the first minute we set our stall out and it went on the full 90 minutes that way.“The gaffer wants us to try to play and build up a bit but when we lose the ball he wants us to press straight away.“That’s exactly what we did and it worked fantastic.“You could hear the crowd were happy with the performance and we really stuck together out there.“On another day it could be 5-0. We won 2-0 and I was buzzing for Naisy to get a couple of goals.“It was a positive night.”When asked about whether the squad find the new Uefa Nations League beneficial, the Carnoustie-raised midfielder added: “Friendlies are different, it’s hard with friendlies being so laid back.“Now the chance of the Nations League – it’s fantastic for everyone involved.“Those competitive games are fantastic to play. There was a real spirit among the boys and we looked good.”Ahead of their next group clash away to Israel next month, McDonald hopes an attractive style of play and positive results can bring fans back.Just 17,455 were at Hampden on Monday night to witness Scotland’s first win under McLeish as the future of the national stadium remains shrouded in doubt.“To get the fans back on our side they want to see some good football and they want to see us winning and we can only do that by putting in performances.“I’m sure if we continue to do that the fans will come back.“Regardless of if it’s home or away we want to go out and win, it’s that simple.“We’re going to try to win every single game we can and putting in performances like Monday night then, if we continue to play that way, I’m sure we’ll be close to winning that group.”And McDonald hopes to continue to be involved in a dark blue shirt, as long as he can stay in the Fulham starting line-up.After making the step up to the Premier League this season, the West London club have invested heavily in their squad.However, McDonald believes the competition for places can only benefit himslef and fellow-Scot Tom Cairney – not included in the latest squad.He added: “We’ve brought in some high-quality players and we know there’ll be a lot of rotation this season which is probably what we need.“We’re all aiming towards the same goal to stay in the Premier League and I want to play as much as I can.“It’s good the manager lives that way, he lives not far from Fulham, so that can only be a positive especially with the football we’re playing. He’s been impressed with myself and Tom so, hopefully, it stays that way.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b97881ed2a8e-848x564.jpg ","title":"hurry out of towners from maggies penguin parade on display in dundee for a week only","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThey have spent all summer posted around Angus, Fife and Perth, drawing crowds of people eager to complete the Maggie’s Penguin Parade sticker book.But now 12 “out of towners” have become a main attraction in Dundee city centre as a last hurrah before being auctioned off.A dozen brightly coloured penguin statues collected from Perth, Brechin, Kirriemuir, St Andrews and Carnoustie have gone on display outside The McManus for one week only.Penguin Parade spokeswoman Annie Long said: “It’s just a chance for people who may not have had a chance to get out of the city to see the penguins that were in Brechin, St Andrews, Perth and other places.”The penguins will be outside the museum until Sunday, before joining the rest of the penguins in Slessor Gardens for one last goodbye the following weekend.All 81 full-size penguins plus 100 baby penguins will go on display together on Saturday and Sunday September 22 and 23.Tickets from Dundee Box Office cost £10 for a family of four, £4 for adults and £2 for children.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"i was looking to see if i could go elsewhere ex celtic kid paul mcmullan back from the brink at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWinger Paul McMullan has revealed there was a real chance of him leaving Dundee United before the transfer window closed a week ago.And the former Scotland U/21 international can’t rule out being on the move when the next window opens in January.However, between now and then, the former Celtic kid, who was brought to Tannadice by Ray McKinnon before the start of last season, insists his only focus will be on winning back a regular first-team place.That fight will continue in today’s Irn-Bru Cup second-round clash with Alloa, a game McMullan concedes he might not have been involved in.“The speculation last week, it was true. I was having a look to see if I could go elsewhere because the playing time here has been limited,” he said.“In the end there wasn’t anything that I felt attracted me more than Dundee United did, so that’s why I’m still here.“The club had made it pretty clear to me that, if I wanted to move on, they weren’t going to stand in my way, they’d let me go.“Between now and January I’ve got to get my head down and try to get time on the park.“And when it comes to January I will re-evaluate because I will only have six months on my contract left. I will have to look at it.“Right now, though, I’m just doing my best to try to get back into the team and see how that works. I’m not looking at anything else, I’m just focused on getting in the team and contributing.”With that in mind he is not looking at tomorrow and the Irn-Bru Cup, a competition United have made clear is not a priority this term, with any sense of disdain.He sees it as another chance to show manager Csaba Laszlo, who’s likely to be watching from the stand as reserve manager Craig Easton takes charge of the team, he should be in the starting line-up every week.For fans turning up, history suggests McMullan’s presence could mean they will be in for another late show.When the teams met at the same stage this time last year, he and Willo Flood struck deep in injury time to earn United victory.And in the first round this season, it was McMullan’s last-gasp strike that secured a remarkable comeback win over St Johnstone Colts, who’d been two up late on. This time he’d settle for the winner to come a little earlier than that.“I’ve done that a couple of times with late goals in this cup,” he added.“Hopefully, we don’t leave it until that late again and the boys can do well and get into the next round.“It would be nice to have a more straightforward victory but it is going to be a hard game and we saw at the weekend how tough it is playing against Alloa.“We just have to take it as it comes and see how we get on.”With Alloa expected to be along the same lines as when they lined up against United in the Championship last Saturday, McMullan knows making the third round could be a big ask.“I wouldn’t think they will make too many changes but it’s an opportunity for us to show what we do and we will try to take it.“It will be a good learning process for the younger ones in our team and a good test against seasoned pros who know what the game is all about.“For me, it’s an opportunity to show what I can do and that’s what I have to keep on doing.“I feel I’ve done OK, it’s just the chances haven’t been there for one reason or another and there’s not a lot I can do about that.“All I can do is stay patient and, if an opportunity comes, do all you can to make sure I take it as best I can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b97b5409ea4a-823x564.jpg ","title":"planners urge council to reject 90 home development on dundee whisky bottling site","story":"\t\t\t\t\tProposals for a major new housing development on the site of a former Dundee whisky bottling plant are being recommended for refusal by city planners.Persimmon Homes has applied to Dundee City Council for permission in principle for up to 90 houses on the site of Stewart House, the former Stewart’s Cream of the Barley plant on Kingsway East.However, city councillors will be asked on Monday to refuse permission for the £10 million development.In a report to go before members of the council’s planning committee, executive director of city development Mike Galloway said councillors should reject the application because it did not comply with the local development plan.He said: “The site is allocated as a general economic development area in the Dundee Local Development Plan 2014.“The principle of residential development at this site fails to comply with the relevant provisions of the development plan and there are no material planning considerations of sufficient weight that would justify approval of the application.”Mr Galloway said the council had identified the site as employment land to support the growth of the economy and a diverse range of industries.“The proposal would result in the loss of allocated economic development land which is in close proximity to the Port of Dundee and Kingsway,” he added.“Residential development at this site would have a detrimental impact on the supply of employment land in the locality. The proposed residential development would result in a reduction in the quality and diversity of business land in Dundee.“The principle of residential development would fail to support the aims of the

irn bru cup","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Irn-Bru Cup might not matter to Dundee United but Saturday’s second-round clash with Alloa at Tannadice might just prove to be one of the most significant days in their season.Craig Easton’s mix of kids and fringe players showed guts and character but just fell short as they lost the lead late on before exiting on penalties.As was signalled by less than 1,000 home fans turning up, however, few connected with the Tangerines will be bothered about that.What was both important and a massive positive, was the sight of club captain Fraser Fyvie making his long-awaited return from injury.Fyvie hadn’t been seen on Tannadice since two days before Christmas when a serious knee injury ended his season.Given the difference in results with and without him last term, it could be strongly argued the minute he went down clutching his knee also effectively killed off the campaign for the team as a whole.Now he’s back, manager Csaba Laszlo will be hoping he has the same influence as during his opening months at the club.Encouraging as the sight of him running on was, he will, of course, still need time to get up to speed in terms of match sharpness.Accordingly, the plan is for a few reserve outings to build strength and stamina before he returns to the full first team for the all- important Championship action.For Laszlo and the fans that time can’t come soon enough but those who turned up on Saturday were at least given glimpses of just how much he has to offer.There were a couple of passes from deep that turned defence into attack in an instant and a thunderous free-kick that provided the final action of game time and would have seen his return capped with a dramatic winner had it not be for a fine save from Neil Parry in the Alloa goal.Indeed, in a strange 90 minutes that saw the visitors dominate possession at times, but for Parry, Easton could have been looking forward to the third round.Over the piece, Alloa did more of the attacking but lacked the quality up front to finish off the good approach work.Often hitting on the break, United were able to create clear chances but found Parry in top form.After a crisp Matty Smith strike had given United the lead against the run of play on 15 minutes, Parry was soon denying the same player with an excellent stop, though somehow Greg Aitken failed to spot his touch and awarded a goal kick.Parry’s ability was recognised before the interval when he then made a superb stop to touch a Paul McMullan free-kick round the post.And he was the hero in the opening minutes of the second period as he plucked a Declan Glass 18-yarder out of the air, then did very well to beat away an Archie Thomas strike.For all that, Alloa continued to look a threat and when they were finally given a clear chance, from the penalty spot, Alan Trouten made no mistake, sending the ball past Benjamin Siegrist for the equaliser.If Jim Goodwin’s team fancied their chances of going on to get a winner in 90 minutes, they had further cause to be grateful to their goalkeeper as he denied Thomas and Fyvie in injury time to take the tie to a penalty shootout.It saw nine of the 10

current incumbent of the Dens Park hot seat.The Dee are slumped at the foot of the Premier League table and with a trip to McCann\u0026#8217s former employers Rangers next up, on September 15, there are concerns the club could soon become entrenched in the drop zone.A Tele online poll revealed yesterday that 80% of surveyed fans wanted McCann to leave.In the same survey we asked who supporters would want to take over in the event of McCann\u0026#8217s departure, and the voting was tight.Of the 186 people who suggested a new manager, the most preferred candidate was Robbie Neilson, with 28 votes. 100vw, 643px\" /The 38-year-old, who made 21 appearances for Dundee United in 2011-12, led Hearts from the Championship to the Europa League in the space of two years before leaving for MK Dons in November 2016. Currently out of a job, compensation wouldn\u0026#8217t be a problem for Dundee owner Tim Keyes.Second, on 25 votes, was David Hopkin. However, the poll was held immediately prior to the former Livingston manager starting a new post in charge of Bradford City so would now be out of the frame.Many others called for Dundee legend Jim Duffy to return for a third spell in charge of the club. With 22 votes, the 59-year-old was the third most desired manager. Duffy has twice led The Dee to Hampden finals and was in charge during the period of administration in 2003. Duffy has been out of management since leaving Greenock Morton in April.Former Scotland manage Gordon Strachan, ex Dundee United striker Jim McIntyre, St Johnstone boss Tommy Wright and new signing Kenny Miller were also touted as potential successors to McCann at Dens Park.\u0026nbspFull list:Robbie Neilson: 28 votesDavid Hopkin: 25Jim Duffy: 22Gordon Strachan: 20Jim McIntyre: 16John Hughes: 10Tommy Wright: 9Kenny Miller: 8Peter Houston: 6Jimmy Boyle: 4Jocky Scott: 3Barry Smith: 3Alan Stubbs: 3Steve Clarke: 2Temuri Ketsbaia: 2Ally McCoist: 2James McPake: 2Georgi Nemsadze: 2Mick McCarthy: 2Paul Lambert: 2Ian Cathro: 1Dave Martin: 1Jim Long: 1Lee Clark: 1Rab Douglas: 1Walter Smith: 1Stewart McCall: 1Stewart Petrie: 1Charlie Adam: 1Paul Hartley: 1Fabian Caballero: 1Pat Nevin: 1Morgan Wieghorst: 1Owen Coyle: 1Joe Jordan: 1\u0026nbspOf the 1,609 votes submitted, 1,297 believed his time as\u0026nbsp80%1,297 no312 yes1609\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/grob-Bar-151.JPG.jpg ","title":"stars from boyzone and westlife to perform in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBoyband stars Keith Duffy and Brian McFadden are heading to Dundee for a brand new show.The Irish hearthrobs will be performing a host of their biggest chart hits as Boyzlife at Church on Friday December 14.McFadden enjoyed 12 UK and Ireland number one hits with Westlife including Swear it Again, If I Let You Go and Queen of My Heart.With Boyzone, Duffy enjoyed similar success including six chart- toppers with 16 of their first single releases making the top five.The group achieved worldwide fame with sales of more than 25 million records.McFadden and Duffy have performed the Boyzlife act throughout the UK since joining forces in 2016.And their Dundee fans can be sure to expect a night of anthems.Tickets for the event are available from musicglue.

with launch of new service that stops off at all city centre attractions","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLocal bus firm Xplore Dundee is ready to take a “leap of faith” next week when it launches a new city centre service on a three-month trial.The 360 City Circle bus will link all of the centre\u0026#8217s tourist attractions in a single 20-minute route, connecting the bus and train stations along the way.Christine McGlasson, managing director of Xplore, said the firm was stepping into the unknown with the new route.But she hopes tourists and locals alike will embrace the service during its trial run.“This is the right time to run a service like this,” said Christine.“We want to help people get around the city centre easily and folk have been calling out for a service like this for years.“It really is a leap of faith though – we’re just taking a chance on something we think people will use.“And if ever there was a time to try it out, it’s now.“Hopefully, we can get make a big success of it – we need people to get on board for that.”Xplore has secured the loan of a £220,000 demonstrator bus from Northern Irish firm Wrightbus for the three-month trial.Tourists boarding the bus – which has eye-catching electric green livery featuring graphics of city landmarks – can pick up a brochure showing them the full route, as well as links to other services to places further afield, such as Broughty Ferry.The all-electric bus can operate all day without having to be charged, running from 8am-5.30pm at a fixed price of £3 for adults and £2 for children.Should the trial be considered a success, Xplore hopes to either extend its lease of the bus or find money to buy one of its own.Christine added: “The fact is there is a need for this service.“If it is successful, then brilliant – but if need be, we will look into subsidies such as low emission grants and tourism grants to keep it going.“It will all depend on how people use it.“We’re looking into things such as a recording played over the speakers telling people about their next stops, and tying it into tickets like Plusbus, which you can buy when you buy a train ticket to Dundee.“It’s trying to cater for all – local people to give them the connectivity, and people coming in to discover the city.”The Tele joined the 360’s inaugural run around the 2.65-mile route, taking in the Waterfront, Overgate, Verdant Works, McManus and Foxlake.The eco-friendly bus – which can recapture energy lost during braking to keep the battery charged – is zero-emission, apart from a tiny diesel generator used to heat the interior.Among the passengers on the City Circle’s first run were city council development chief Mike Galloway, North East Labour MSP Jenny Marra and local B\u0026ampB owners Barrie and Olwyn Jack. Mr Galloway said: “With the Waterfront coming to fruition and becoming a reality, a service linking everything together is another piece in the puzzle.“I hope it is really successful and does well.”Ms Marra said: “I think it’s great – the more public transport in Dundee the better it is for getting around.“It’s also really important that they’re using an economical bus. It’s great for the environment and I would like to see even more environmentally-friendly buses in the area.”Barrie and Olwyn, who run Duntrune House north of the city, say they think the 360 is a “great idea”.Olwyn added: “It’s excellent for people who come into Dundee that don’t have their bearings, linking everything up.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"                          POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"book-your-christmas-party-venue-at-one-of-these-five-festive-spots","story":"                          Whether you can believe it or not, the time for festive planning is here.

But hopes that work would start in June floundered when a council officer and Historic Environment Scotland voiced disquiet over proposals for a rebuild that would have been lower than the original building.Although talks are still ongoing regarding the rebuild, planning officers using delegated powers have now given permission for the demolition on the condition the stones are numbered and stored for the rebuild.Central ward councillor Bet McAllister who will attend a meeting with other councillors, officials and the\u0026nbspowners tomorrow\u0026nbspis confident of a solution and hopes the project will be completed by this time next year.\"I would like to see work start before the end of this year and then once the better weather comes in March or April to have it rebuilt next year unless they hit any other snags,\" she said. \"That would be my dream.\"She also insisted that the building should be reinstated to the same height.\"We will stick to our guns on that,\" she said. \"It has to be done to what we want.\"Cllr McAllister said a compulsory purchase order could be an option if a resolution was not forthcoming.\"Hopefully, it will not come to that,\" she said. \"I am confident the owners will play ball and that everything we have asked them to do will be done.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA council spokeswoman confirmed discussions were continuing regarding a rebuild and expected details of the project\u0027 programme to be released next week.Asked whether the council was considering a compulsory purchase order if the talks and proposals failed, she replied: \"All options remain under consideration which will enable the High Street being restored to full use.\"Pat Hayden, chairwoman of Crown and City Centre Community Council, said work should start as soon as possible and felt a more contemporary design for the rebuild should be considered if it would speed up progress.\u0026nbsp\"Time is being wasted,\" she said. \"If it is too difficult to rebuild as it was, let\u0027 forget it.

their own schemes.Some 70 businesses, including national chains and local independents, have signed up to the Elgin gift card.However, Elgin Embrace manager Gill Neill warned that a successful gift card scheme required a large initial investment.\"We did it on behalf of all our members because it is an incredibly expensive programme to put together,\" she said.\"Set up costs are in the region of \u0026pound20,000, so you will find that most of the town gift cards are being run by business improvement districts on behalf of their membership.\"The businesses in the town have been really, really responsive and really positive, but I think a big part of that is we are covering the costs.\"I strongly suspect that if we had not and had been asking people to pay, you would not have had the same uptake.\"The initiative has also been well received by shoppers in the town.\"The public see it as a very positive thing,\" she added.\"Rather than being given a specific gift card that they use in one shop, they get an Elgin Gift Card that they can used in one of the 70 places in the town.\"They can use it to buy clothes, get their hair done, have a meal or put it towards a holiday or buying furniture.\"People are still very positive about embracing the Shop Local message and we hope this will encourage people to perhaps visit businesses they have never used before.\"From the point of

If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notifications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notifications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specifying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item if they are not at home when we deliver. Email and SMS notifications will let customers either re-arrange their parcel delivery for another day or collect their item from their local Customer Service Point using relevant identification. Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels  to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 3:16 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSomething slightly different in this edition.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live life as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them. Throughout September, headline partner M\u0026ampS will be selling a selection of limited edition coffee morning products \u0026#8211 including lots of cakes, biscuits and two exclusive mugs \u0026#8211 with 10 per cent of proceeds going to Macmillan.Homes, workplaces and communities from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End will be hosting coffee mornings this year readers in Argyll and Bute can find events nearby using the interactive map on the Coffee Morning website www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee.Thank you to everyone who gets involved.Joanna Lumley, actress and Macmillan supporterSir,The SNP announced it is starting up a new \u0026#8216fact-checking\u0026#8217 service to monitor the accuracy of research and political statements.Many people in Scotland will be wondering if the SNP will be fact-checking the cost of its new independence blueprint.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events.

Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt.

Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most individual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw.

Joe Chapman, 23, is taking part in this September’s Great Scottish Run following the tragic death of his pregnant wife, Holly Chapman, to cystic fibrosis when she was just 23 years old. Holly was aged just one and a half when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and although she was in and out of hospital regularly, it was something she kept very private to those around her. Joe said: “Holly and I met at the school we both attended down in England. “We started going out in 2010 and got married in August 2015. “I only found out she had the condition after about eight months of us being together. It wasn’t something she really spoke about, she just dealt with it. “It was probably around 2012 that we noticed her health slowly deteriorating. “She would be in hospital around two to three times a year for a two-week period to go on an IV drip to boost her immune system and clear chest infections. “Every year since then she would be in hospital more and more.” Due to Holly needing IV drips more frequently, Joe and Holly’s Mum received training to give Holly IV drips from home, rather than being in hospital for long periods at a time. On November 27, 2017 Holly found out she was pregnant, but at the same time her health was beginning to deteriorate at a much faster rate. Joe said: “Holly was needing to be in hospital for around six to seven weeks at a time. “I remember her being let out for six days at Christmas but she really couldn’t do much herself, she got too out of breath. “I had to carry her up and down the stairs and help her get dressed. She was also permanently on oxygen.” This continued through until March 8 this year, where Holly had a fit at home and was taken away in an ambulance to Ayr Hospital. She was transferred to a specialist unit in Glasgow, where her health got slightly better over the next couple of days. Joe added: “The specialist advised if she didn’t improve, that we should consider aborting our baby. On March 13, Holly became so ill that we decided it was time to let her be at peace and we made the decision to turn off her ventilator. Holly left the world far too young due to this horrible disease. “Cystic fibrosis is a really common disease but not many people know much about it which I why I decided to take part in the Great Scottish Run, to raise awareness and also raise vital funds for the trust.” You can sponsor Joe via his JustGiving page: https:www.justgiving/fundraising/joe-chapman9Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalCystic FibrosisCharityAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrs station hotel undergo 24","story":"NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel to undergo 24 hour rescue operation aimed at re-opening platforms to ScotRail trainsThe crumbling building is the subject of a large exclusion zone which has rendered much of Ayr station a no-go zone.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:43, 11 SEP 2018NewsStation Hotel in Ayr \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA painstaking mission aimed at re-opening parts of Ayr railway station is to get underway. Safety teams will work 24 hours a day to try and get the hub moving again. Work, which begins this Saturday, is expected to last until mid-October. Council bosses hope their move will reduce the extended exclusion zone which has paralysed the town\u0027s train station. Services to Glasgow Central are currently restricted in size with all six carriage trains halting at Prestwick Town. All trains south of Ayr are cancelled. Contractors are now set to move in with the aim of reinstating those lost services. Council chief executive, Eileen Howat, said: The extended exclusion zone at the train station – and its impact on rail services – is far from ideal, but we’ve had to take this action to keep people safe and that’s something we cannot, and will not, take any chances with. Our priority right now is to do what’s needed to allow the extended exclusion zone to be reduced when safe to do so and for rail services to get back to normal, and that’s exactly what we’re doing.  Once that has been achieved, we will continue to progress the wider programme of public safety works as well as the works to complete a structural survey, which will help inform the next steps with regards to the building’s future.   Andrew Mackie, Transport Scotland’s Head of Rail Franchising, added: In the longer term, any solution identified must contribute to the economic prosperity of the town centre and the communities south of Ayr currently without a train service.  This means we need to explore all the available options for dealing with the Station Hotel property which, in its current state, presents a significant safety risk not only to the railway line but also the immediate vicinity.  Only by continuing to work in close partnership with the relevant agencies and the local community can we reach an effective solution for everyone concerned - particularly those passengers, the local community and businesses directly affected.   ScotRail Head of Service Planning, Dave Smith, said: The beginning of the works to remove the extended exclusion zone is a fantastic step forward and until then we are working flat out to keep our customers moving.

Debby McKenzie had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis with a future that looked downhill all the way. She admits not in her wildest dreams could she have imagined her life now. Debby, who turned 50 on Tuesday, is just back from a three-month odyssey to Uganda. It was her first visit after setting up the charity McKenzie Clinic which focuses on children with the worst medical conditions. Some remote parts of the country she went to were a 10-hour drive over pot-holed dirt roads from her base in the capital Kampala. And she found herself packed in the back of overcrowded people carriers, with chickens running loose at her feet. Debby, who grew up in Prestwick but now lives in Ayr, said: “It is not very nice to be perfectly honest. It is a country with nothing. “It was always my dream to go to Africa and do some volunteer work, but it has escalated into a full blown charity which I registered in May 2017.” She has used her networking skills to bring volunteers together and they fund operations and aftercare for the children. Uganda was declared independent from Britain in 1962 and is landlocked, though you would not realise it, as the vast Lake Victoria straddles half its southern border. The great lake is 85 per cent the size of Scotland. The population is about 42 million and seems to attract dictators – Idi Amin during the seventies the most notorious. And it is dirt poor, says Debby, with lost of aid going to line the pockets of the rich. She flew into Entebbe and then headed to her host family in the capital where she stayed. From there, she visited ious organisations in all parts of the country. Debby, a divorced mum-of-one, revealed: “The roads are a nightmare and I always went by public transport. You get chickens at your feet and chickens on the roof. “It is very backward and for a couple of years I had been supporting charities there and they invited me over, so I decided I would go.” It is estimated some of the charities Debby was donating to were only able to get 30 per cent of funds to the people who needed them, the rest going to buy luxury goods for the elite. Debby said: “The aftercare is so important, I didn’t want them to be operated on then we walk away. “They have no life, no food and are malnourished. So I find sponsors to get them food weekly, mattresses and try and get them schooling. “We have just enrolled a girl into college who wants to be a hairdresser and we have paid the first year’s fee and accomodation. “People are joining the charity all the time as they want to help and I have been able to build a medical team on the ground in Uganda. “I have a huge online team of volunteers.” Debby was an independent financial adviser but eventually had to give up the business when she was diagnosed with MS 19 years ago.  She said: “I spent years not being able to see out of my right eye, I couldn’t speak, I lost my  co-ordination and I was paralysed down my right side.  “I was bed-ridden for a good couple of years.” She buried herself in research, went on to natural medications, exercised and changed her diet. Combined with a positive mental attitude it actually worked – and she is now sympton and fatigue free. Debby went on: “I really thought my life was over. But it is not, and it is now my time to help others.” The charity has seven acres of ground and the next project is to build a medical village and eco farm. Volunteers pay to get themselves out to Africa, but the charity pays for accomodation, transport and food. Debby added: “My big thing at the moment is we dont just want to operate or treat the children, we want to make sure they are going to be ok. “Everywhere you go you see horrific surgical cases, some of it is mind-blowing. “Most of the time I just have to step over them and walk away because I cannot help everyone. That is the hardest part.” Debby’s daughter Jessica,28, said: “Mum found an African surgeon, Dr Allan Lubiite, who also was deeply concerned about the conditions that Ugandan families were living in. “Mum’s work has helped save many children already and is funded solely from 15,000 people who are part of her Facebook groups. “She calls herself the voice of the voiceless and I am so proud of her.” A fundraiser is being held at the Berkeley Hotel in Barns Street, Ayr on Monday September 17 in the shape of a psychic and BBQ evening. It is being held to cover the expenses of volunteers while they are part of a dentistry team heading to Uganda at the end of the year. Just turn up at the door at 6.30pm.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsFacebookSocial mediaCharityPrestwick"},{"url":null,"title":"people given say regeneration ayr","story":"NewsPeople are to be given a say on regeneration of Ayr town centreAn \u0027Olympic\u0027 class swimming pool earmarked to replace CitadelShare\u0026nbspBySarah Hilley12:46, 11 SEP 2018Updated09:50, 12 SEP 2018NewsCitadel Leisure Centre Ayr\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn “Olympic” class swimming pool is earmarked for Ayr High Street to replace the aging Citadel, writes Sarah Hilley And the recently cleared Riverside block will become a public square, radical new council proposals reveal. A museum in the Town Hall and a drive to convert empty shop units for housing have also been put forward. It is all part of South Ayrshire Council’s answer to save the ailing High Street and politicians are launching a consultation to get feedback. Revealing the masterplan, council leader Douglas Campbell said: “The Citadel is coming to the end of its useful life. We would like to speak to people about moving the swimming pool into the middle of the town.” Deputy council leader Brian McGinley said: “There is potential for an Olympic style swimming pool. We need Ayr to be a destination. “If we move it to the town centre we will have other businesses coming in because of the increased footfall.” Replacing the High Street with an easy clean surface to get rid of chewing gum and other grime is another proposal to clean up the town. Council offices have been ruled out for good at the Riverside site after public protest over designs. Instead council staff would work at the newly refurbished old Clydesdale Bank building, other existing offices and a new archives base at Ayr Academy. Councillor Campbell said: “It will be a large public square and we want to ask people if they think it is a good idea.” Planning rules are to be changed so empty ground floor shops can be transformed into homes. Councillor Campbell said: “We need to reduce the number of shops in Ayr. One way to do that is to move residential accommodation down to the ground floor. We want to encourage residential development at the bottom of the town. We want the High Street to work 18 hours a day instead of eight. The town centre is dead at night. It is off putting. People go to Prestwick for the buzz.” Councillor McGinley said: “Retail is dead. The town centre needs to be re-invigorated.” It is hoped the empty former bridal shop at the Town Hall could house a new museum. Councillor Campbell said: “We have some fantastic artefacts hidden away. Let’s get them out in the open.” All ideas have yet to undergo public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnMuseumsSouth Ayrshire CouncilPrestwickAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick airport could used free","story":"NewsPrestwick Airport could be used as free parking base for ScotRail passengers on Ayr to Glasgow Central lineGovernment officials have pledged to examine the possibility of using the airport - which they own - for free parking relief to help ease the pain of commuters.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:08, 6 SEP 2018NewsPrestwick Airport could be used for free parking \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrestwick Airport could be used as an unlikely saviour in the ongoing crisis at Ayr Railway Station. Government bosses are examining a plan to utilise the flight hub - which they own - for free parking. A number of services on the Ayr to Glasgow Central line will start and terminate at Prestwick Town from next Monday. But with concerns over a lack of parking in the town, transport chiefs have begun scrambling for other options. Ayr MSP, John Scott, led calls for the move to be considered during First Minister\u0027s Questions today in Holyrood. After raising the issue with Nicola Sturgeon, he told the Ayrshire Post: This is now a crisis situation and we should be looking at all available options. Parking in Prestwick is at a premium as it is, so if the airport can provide free spaces until this situation is resolved, it is something we should look at. Responding to Mr Scott\u0027s idea in parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: It strikes me as a very good suggestion and I can\u0027t think of any immediate objection anyone would have. We know the pressure this is putting on commuters. The First Minister has pledged to explore the option with her officials. Four carriage services will continue to operate between Ayr and Glasgow, but six carriage trains will be halted at Prestwick as part of ScotRail\u0027s plan to combat overcrowding on the line. It comes as crisis engulfs Ayr station with the crumbling overhead hotel, owned by a private Malaysian businessman, subject to a large exclusion zone.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnNicola SturgeonPrestwick AirportScotrailGlasgowAyrTransportAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"stagecoach accused turning ayr street","story":"NewsStagecoach accused of turning Ayr street into \u0027deathtrap\u0027 as double deckers thunder down back roadNeighbours say double decker buses accessing the Waggon Road depot in Ayr are thundering along quiet Green Street at all times of the day and night after a route change.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson13:59, 7 SEP 2018NewsResidents protest outside the bus garage \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFurious residents claim a bus giant has turned their back street into a deathtrap.

It\u0026rsquos subjective.\n\u0026ldquoThe officers and the consultees have expressed reservations, even though they might not have objected.\n\u0026ldquoI think when you join together all these different aspects, of the reservoir, of the William Ogilvie cairn, the cumulative and residential impacts, in my view that makes this application unacceptable.\nA report put to the committee found that 75 comments had been submitted to Scottish Borders Council regarding the project, and all but one of those were objections.\nThe council also received objections from six community councils that would be within sight of the wind farm, and Hawick councillors David Paterson and Watson McAteer also voiced their objections.\nThe latter wrote to his fellow councillors, imploring them to reject the wind farm: \u0026ldquoThis application is a test and should this authority grant the application it is in danger of sending a signal to all developers that rejection is simply a temporary set back and that after some fine tuning reapplication is likely to be successful.\n\u0026ldquoThis approach is debilitating for fragile communities who are being worn down by commercial enterprises that bring financial muscle to a process destined to create over proliferation, landscape desecration and wind turbine blight to a naturally beautiful area of the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoMembers, those I represent can see no valid reason why the previous rejection is not equally valid today and it is your responsibility to ensure that this community is listened to.\n\u0026ldquoIt is quite ridiculous that those who live and nurture this area are once again being called to fight to protect a precious environment, that includes a perilous roads network, from a profit centred business who have no interest in the effect their development will have on such a historic rural community.\nNot all councillors opposed the development, however, with East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing proposing a motion to support officer\u0026rsquos recommendations and approve the application, which Tweeddale East councillor Eric Small seconded.\nCouncillor Laing said the revised plans were a big improvement on the 2012 application: \u0026ldquoI think there has been a significant change to what they have proposed.\n\u0026ldquoI do have my concerns, particularly around the impact on nearby properties, but on balance I am supportive of the officer\u0026rsquos recommendations. There are lots of advantages to this.\nDespite councillor Laing and councillor Small\u0026rsquos support for the bid, the remaining five members of the committee voted to reject the proposals.\nSpeaking after the meeting, ABO Wind\u0026rsquos head of development, Clark Crosbie, said: \u0026ldquoWe are extremely disappointed by the decision of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee.\n\u0026ldquoWe have worked very closely and collaboratively with a wide range of stakeholders over the past few years to develop this project and we believe very strongly that it complied

councillors voted to allow its demolition.\nSt Aidan\u0026rsquos Church, in Gala Park, is set to face the wrecking ball after the owners, Cumbria-based Book Development, concluded that renovating the B-listed Gothic church would be uneconomical.\nAt a meeting of Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday, principal planning officer Barry Fotheringham said demolition was the only economically viable option left.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoThe building is not physically incapable of repair, therefore the overriding principle that needs to be satisfied is one of economic viability.\n\u0026ldquoThis application is supported by feasibility reports and valuations which estimate the building is beyond the point of economic repair.\n\u0026ldquoVarious options have been explored, including the conversion of the church into residential properties, though this would incur a loss of \u0026pound700,000, based on 2018 costs.\n\u0026ldquoAn alternative scheme for a development which would retain the front facade of the church and the spire was also evaluated, and this would potentially result in a loss of around \u0026pound1m.\n\u0026ldquoThe applicant provided subsequent figures that would need to be invested in order to make a profit. \u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoThese assessments conclude that in order to make a reasonable profit, 29 units would be required on site, with 24 units behind the facade and five on the site behind the church.\n\u0026ldquoIt is accepted that not all options have been explored, but it is reasonable to assume that the applicant has demonstrated that a substantial and likely inappropriate development would be required to make the scheme viable.\n\u0026ldquoI am satisfied that the viability argument has been met.\nSpeaking in favour of allowing the demolition, East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: \u0026ldquoI just think this is really, really sad to lose this fabulous building.

Susan and Hazel were content running their successful store, which has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, wholefoods, jams and chutney since 2011.\nThey had always been open to suggestions from residents on new products and ideas \u0026ndash creating a monthly cheese tasting evening, and a popular home delivery service.\nWhen news hit the town of the Post Office closure in February last year, the community fought a hard campaign to see its full-time service return.\nThe impact of the closure was felt by the Allotment and other High Street businesses. Susan explained: \u0026ldquoWhen it closed, a lot of people who previously used the Post Office started going out of the town and naturally doing their shopping elsewhere. It hit Innerleithen hard.\nThe pair had previously laughed off any suggestions by locals that they could house the Post Office within their store.\nBut one evening in late December, something moved Susan to click a link online to find out more information \u0026ndash and from this very moment, the revival of the Post Office began.\nNo-one had officially approached them to take on the Post Office, so when asked what moved them to send the application, Susan and Hazel looked at one another and mused: \u0026ldquoYou could call it insanity!\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot easily signed, sealed and delivered. There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of life, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance.

believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a significant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be significantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see if there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite significantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either

Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know what went on in the past \u0026#8211 especially involving someone from Argyll.\u0026#8217The exhibition, which was launched in Oban in

Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a different pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang returned, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924. In 1925 a christian name is inscribed for the first time, when, Bella Strang, taking her third win, was partnered by  Mr C. MacTaggart.Mrs W. McKersie and Mr C. McTaggart won in 1926 and Miss S.

Consequently, it has not been possible to derive much pathological information from these cases, which is a pain, as this is information we need to identify possible causes of death.\u0026#8216Cuvier’s beaked whales  are native to both British and Irish waters where they occur in deep waters, typically greater than 50 km offshore. It is well documented that Cuvier’s beaked whales are one of the most sensitive species to acoustic disturbance.\u0026#8216Beaked whales, like many cetaceans, ‘see’ the world through sound, so excessive underwater noise can have potentially disastrous effects on their physiology and behaviour. Loud noise can damage the sensitive hair cells in the ear, rendering the animal functionally deaf, or cause gas bubbles to form in the tissues leading to the equivalent of the bends.\u0026#8216Unfortunately, many of the pathological indicators left by excessive exposure to underwater noise are rapidly lost after death, so in most of these cases we won’t have much to go on based on examination of the carcases alone.\u0026#8216The more cases we find, the more chance we have of being able to triangulate a possible origin for these deaths.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"charity putting match on sunday","story":"It will be a fun day for all the family, with ladies, gents and junior prizes, teas, coffees and baking, and there will be a bouncy castle to keep the kids entertained.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.

If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.

All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.

Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo.

This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

The latest development will be to the east of the site earmarked for a new primary school on the large development area on Haddington\u0026rsquos western edge which is expected to have more than 800 new homes once complete.  Provost John McMillan, ward councillor, raised concerns from local constituents about dust and road washing equipment used on the site over the summer.  Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked if it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational significance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as if it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

Tim Cairns, who worked with former Stormont enterprise minister Jonathan Bell, disagreed.  The RHI public inquiry chairman, retired judge Sir Patrick Coghlin, said: \u0026ldquoOne of you is accurate or telling the truth about that \u0026ndash not both.  He said he was trying to assess their credibility, adding: \u0026ldquoBoth of those cannot be true.  Mr Cairns acknowledged their accounts differed.  Earlier stages of the inquiry have heard there was a mistaken belief among those involved in designing the RHI that the Treasury would pick up the bill for overspending on subsidies.  The intention was to have as many as possible enrolled to attract funds to Northern Ireland.  Mr Cairns said he believed the bill for RHI was being covered by Westminster and it was a \u0026ldquovalid step to delay change beyond the October 1 date favoured by civil servants.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos better to be spent in Belfast than Bristol.  The scheme became over-subscribed by wood fuel burner owners and threatened to incur a massive overspend on public coffers.  Concerns centred on how long it took to close after civil servants became aware of the flaws.  The devolved powersharing institutions collapsed early last year after Sinn Fein walked out over the DUP\u0026rsquos handling of the RHI, and repeated rounds of negotiations have failed to resurrect them.  Mr Cairns disclosed details of exchanges between party advisers around the closure of the scheme.  On 20 July 2015, he received an email from Dr Crawford, his predecessor as DUP adviser at the Enterprise Department.  Dr Crawford warned him that cuts to subsidies were expected to come in October and \u0026ldquoyou are going to get a massive spike of applications before this date.  Mr Cairns said he passed the information on to a civil servant.  Sir Patrick said Dr Crawford instructed Mr Cairns to call him to discuss the RHI scheme. Mr Cairns expressed regret that there was no written record.  \u0026ldquoWith hindsight it is abundantly clear to me that we really should have just sat round the table, got everybody interested around the table, and got this thrashed out.  \u0026ldquoI was relying on phone calls and this shuttle diplomacy that really was deficient.  \u0026ldquoYou have to be able to say that you did your best or, electorally, that is going to be a problem."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8018957.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"owen-mcintosh-celtic-fans-horrified-as-coach-driver-pulls-bus-over-and-batters-fellow-motorist","story":"  Owen McIntosh, 47, attacked banker Kevin Wall, 47, in front of his wife in a road rage incident when he was driving supporters home from a match.  Perth Sheriff Court was told on Wednesday that the assault conviction was likely to lead to his dismissal from his job driving vulnerable people for the local authority.  Solicitor Jamie Baxter, defending, said: \"He has held employment with Glasgow City Council as a driver for children with special needs for 19 years.  \"As a consequence of this it is likely that his job will be terminated. He is already suspended and subject to an ongoing investigation.\"  Sheriff Gillian Wade, who found McIntosh guilty of assault after a trial, fined him \u0026pound750.  She told him: \"It was a most unfortunate incident to have taken place and you are now suffering the consequences of having a conviction for assault on your record.  \"This will be very much felt by yourself. It is important you put this behind you.\"  McIntosh was driving a coach full of Celtic fans which crashed into a car in a road rage incident on the A9. He then parked and got out to punch Mr Wall, from Uphall, in the face.  Mr Wall told the court: \"My wife Alexa was asleep. The bus sped up as I was braking. The chevrons were coming up and the lanes were merging.  \"The bus was driving right behind me. I saw him gesticulating at me. I thought it was some sort of road rage about something.  \"He was hooting his horn and flashing his lights and my wife woke up. I thought I should slow down in case anything happened.  \"I was frightened. My wife was frightened.\"  He said the bus pulled out into the oncoming carriageway to overtake but cars appeared travelling towards them and McIntosh swerved the football coach back in.  \"The bus pulled over and hit the rear of my car. I was trying to keep the car straight on the road. The car bounced. I felt it shudder.  \"It was quite clear we had been hit at about 50 miles per hour. My hands were shaking,\" Mr Wall said.  He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans returning from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer. I saw his raised fist above me and he banged it down on my temple.  \"I hammered backwards into the car. I saw a white light. After a second or two I came too with my wife screaming.  \"I had a lump on the side of my head which the policeman described as the size of a small egg. I don\u0027t think I could believe it.\"  Mr Wall said he told McIntosh he was calling the police and that prompted him to usher the fans back into the bus and drive off.  McIntosh, Stewart Crescent, Barrhead, was found guilty of assaulting Mr Wall on the A9 by punching him on the head to his injury on 16 April 2017.  He was acquitted on a second charge of driving dangerously by overtaking when it was unsafe to so and colliding with the rear of Mr Wall\u0027s car.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"face-to-face-with-philip-long-the-director-of-the-new-va-dundee-on-building-the-citys-future","story":"  And what an institution. The V\u0026ampA Dundee, as well as being a show-stopping piece of architecture courtesy of the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, is also a keynote building in the future of the city in which it is based, part of Dundee\u0026rsquos long-term plans for the waterfront .  As a result, it\u0026rsquos difficult to imagine a building in Scotland that will open with more hype, hope and razzmatazz.  \u0026ldquoThe opening of the V\u0026ampA Dundee is a big moment, agrees Long. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a big moment for the institution, but it\u0026rsquos a big moment in the life of Dundee. And I get a sense that there\u0026rsquos excitement about the project much further afield than that. So, we want to make sure that it\u0026rsquos celebrated in a pretty spectacular way.  Over and above the celebrations that will accompany the opening , the museum is also tasked with creating an economic uplift for the city, in effect Dundee\u0026rsquos very own \u0026ldquoBilbao effect. No small task in a city that has been hit in recent decades by all the typical problems blighting post-industrial cities.  When we speak the opening is still a few weeks away. Long is sitting in a Portakabin across from the museum\u0026rsquos staff entrance, discussing the past, present and future of this project. When he first came to Dundee in 2011 the city\u0026rsquos waterfront had a long way to go. Where we are sitting, he points out, was the site of the city\u0026rsquos brutalist swimming pool. He used to go himself and be \u0026ldquohorrified and exhilarated by the fumes, he says.  All change. Across the way the museum remains sealed off from prying eyes but the fit-out is complete, the installation of the exhibitions and displays very advanced and the restaurant and caf\u0026eacute ready to go. It\u0026rsquos a Thursday in mid-August. \u0026ldquoOn Monday we have all our visitor assistants starting. That is exciting, says Long.  \u0026ldquoAbout two years we sat down as a team and said what needs to be achieved by the opening day and worked back from that to see exactly what needed to happen in relation to everything else that needed to be done and who needed to do it. And we are on track with that plan.  As you would expect, Long is an articulate spokesman for his museum. Married with two boys, he\u0026rsquos a young-looking 52, who\u0026rsquos been working on this project since 2011. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom a little greyer than I was seven years ago, he says. \u0026ldquoI need a haircut. But I\u0026rsquove been busy.  Well, indeed. The construction of the museum has been a huge financial and technical challenge. Kengo Kuma\u0026rsquos original plans had to be reined in when the tenders for the building came in much higher than expected almost double the original \u0026pound45m. And though more money was found for its construction  it still proved a complex and testing build.  Not that Long was ever in any doubt that it would be completed. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been developed in quite a small city, comparatively, in difficult years of political complexity and economic uncertainty. And I think the prospect of a new V\u0026ampA here was such an exciting prospect that I never thought it wasn\u0026rsquot going to happen.  Now it is on his shoulders to make it a success, of course. Is he ready for the challenge? The size of it is certainly clear to him.  \u0026ldquoPreviously, I was a curator at the National Galleries of Scotland with a responsibility for managing elements of that. But I think there is not much that can prepare anybody for the scale of this project, he admits  But that, adds Long, is also the thrill of it. \u0026ldquoTo have the responsibility to develop a new design institution in Scotland that will take very seriously its role to help people understand why design is important, that is going to look at the amazing design creativity of this country, that can bring international exhibitions to Scotland in that wonderful building, and be part of the V\u0026ampA family, then that is an amazing prospect.  The question might be what does that all entail? Or, to put it more bluntly, what does a director do? He breaks his answer into pre and post opening. \u0026ldquoThe responsibility of the director during the development phase is to develop a sense of ambition and vision for the project. What is it? What is it going to be?  And, having done so, he adds, get that vision across to the people working on the building, its stakeholders and the general public.  His job will now change, Long says. \u0026ldquoThe role will be to make sure that it does fulfil those ambitions and its intention to be an institution that helps make people understand why design is important in all our lives is fulfilled, that it creates opportunities to get more people involved, and that it makes a contribution not just to Dundee but to the country more widely.  What he wants is a building that is welcoming to everyone in Dundee. \u0026ldquoMuseums can be intimidating places or seen as places for an elite. We have developed V\u0026ampA Dundee to challenge that.  In what way? Outreach programmes, talks, forming young people\u0026rsquos groups, he explains. \u0026ldquoWe have engaged with over 100,000 people since 2012 and many of those are here in Dundee.  In a parallel universe Long could have been exhibiting in the museum rather than running it. Or even building the thing.  \u0026ldquoI almost became an architect when I was at school. I had a place to do architecture so maybe doing V\u0026ampA Dundee is fulfilling some of these early ambitions, he says.  Having grown up in Edinburgh\u0026nbspLong actually studied sculpture at art school. \u0026ldquoI trained as an artist, but I very quickly became interested in museums and galleries and how they could make a difference to people.  After studying in England, he returned to Scotland where he worked for the Fine Art Society in Glasgow, before getting a job as a junior curator at the National Galleries of Scotland. He then worked his way up to a senior position.  \u0026ldquoI had a chance to create exhibitions and work with artists and get involved in some major projects, like the development of the former Dean orphanage into the Dean Gallery, now Modern Two. I also looked after the development of Charles Jencks\u0026rsquos Landform and I worked on the development of the Artist Rooms project specifically so it could be shared across the country.  The V\u0026ampA Dundee is of a different order, it must be said. Because there is so much riding on it. But Long reckons it will deliver because the city wants it to. Needs it to, even.  \u0026ldquoWhen I came here what I sensed was there was a real enthusiasm and energy for making a change. But in terms of the physicality of the city there was much to be done on that. The V\u0026ampA Dundee is a complete new development contributing to the economic future of the city.  \u0026ldquoBut what I\u0026rsquove also seen is a sort of change in energy and sense of being able to get things done. Dundee applied to be UK City of Culture. It lost to Hull. It came a very close second, but it didn\u0026rsquot sit back and commiserate. Shortly afterwards it was successful in being awarded the title of Unesco City of Creative Design.  \u0026ldquoWhat I\u0026rsquove seen here in the city is one success leads to a greater ambition. There\u0026rsquos that sense in the city of: \u0026lsquoWe get things done here.\u0026rsquo I think that is really building confidence here.

In April, then social security minister Jeane Freeman added: \u0026ldquoThe new Social Security Scotland service will have a presence in every local authority area.  However, despite the new agency due to deliver its first benefit this week, it has offices in just two councils - its HQ in Dundee and an administrative office in Glasgow.  The figures emerged in a parliamentary written answer from Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville.  She said: \u0026ldquoSocial Security Scotland have been meeting regularly with council representatives to identify suitable opportunities for co-location ahead of local delivery services becoming fully operational. To date, offices in two local authority areas have been acquired, these being the interim Headquarters for Social Security Scotland in Dundee and an interim administrative office in Glasgow.  Ministers have not published a firm timetable for opening high street offices, but the phased roll-out of new devolved benefits means they will be vital by next summer.  However the Scottish Tories claimed the government was falling behind on a key pledge. \u0026nbsp  Tory MSP Michelle Ballantyne said: \u0026ldquoAfter years and years of complaining from the sidelines about welfare reform, the SNP is about to discover just how difficult it is to create a fair and affordable social security system.  \u0026ldquoEarlier this year, it stated every local authority area would have a local presence when it comes to new social security powers. Yet just two of Scotland\u0026rsquos 32 councils have this.  \u0026ldquoThe SNP\u0026rsquos narrative on much-needed welfare reform may have served a certain political purpose for the nationalists. But now ministers have to get on with delivering these payments, and it appears it has got off to a poor start.  Social Security Scotland is due to start its work delivering benefits today, with letters going out to around 75,000 telling them of a new automatic benefit worth \u0026pound221.  The twice-yearly Carers\u0026rsquo Allowance Supplement, which is worth an extra \u0026pound8.50 a week  on top of the UK maximum of \u0026pound64.60, will be backdated to April.  The supplement, will be worth more than \u0026pound30m a year to carers in receipt of DWP Carer\u0026rsquos Allowance on the qualifying date of April 16.  The vast majority of payments are due to be made this month, with the rest in October.  Ms\u0026nbspSomerville, said:\u0026nbsp\"From this week carers across Scotland start getting more money in their pockets as the first payments from Social Security Scotland \u0026ndash Carer\u0026rsquos Allowance Supplement - starts to be paid.\u0026nbsp  \u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoOver the course of this month in excess of 75,000 carers will receive this first additional payment to Carers Allowance of \u0026pound221 to be followed by another payment in December and every six months thereafter.  \"This is an increase of 13% and an investment of over \u0026pound30 million in our carers. We will start paying our second benefit \u0026ndash Best Start Grant \u0026ndash to low income families by Christmas.  \u0026ldquoMaking these payments represents a historic moment, launching a new public service that will deliver a social security system that treats people with dignity, fairness and respect.  \u0026ldquoWe have 100 new recruits in our Dundee headquarters working on the delivery of this benefit including taking calls on our freephone helpline for anyone who would like additional information or support.  \u0026ldquoThis new public service will deliver a further benefits once fully operational \u0026ndash providing vital support to people on low incomes, disabled people and continuing to provide this additional support for carers.

SFA president Alan McRae said: \u0026ldquoToday\u0026rsquos announcement has been the conclusion of a four-year process to review our national stadium beyond 2020.  \u0026ldquoIt was a hugely difficult decision and I would like to place on record our thanks to Scottish Rugby for their professionalism throughout the process.  \u0026ldquoThey made a truly compelling case to move to Edinburgh and gave us a very difficult decision to make. I would like to pay tribute to the inspiration, energy and hard work of Scottish Rugby chief executive, Mark Dodson, and his chief operating officer, Dominic McKay \u0026ndash both are true leaders in Scottish sport.  \u0026ldquoThis decision is about what was best for Scottish football and our members. It is about the future of football in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoI would also like to thank everyone who has been part of this process and to recognise the enormous generosity of Lord Haughey.  \u0026ldquoFinally, it has also been a hugely challenging time for Queen\u0026rsquos Park, Hampden Park Limited and all of the people who will be directly affected by this decision. We appreciate all their efforts to reach an agreement today and look forward to working with them to shape the future and continue to develop a national stadium that we can all be proud of.  SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell said: \u0026ldquoI would first of all like to offer my thanks to Dominic McKay and his team at Scottish Rugby. They have been impressive throughout the process and I would like to continue to build that relationship. There is a lot we can learn from each other.  \u0026ldquoToday is a big day for Scottish football. Hampden Park has been the spiritual home of Scottish football for over 100 years it has been central to our sport\u0026rsquos identity in this country. But today\u0026rsquos decision is about the future, not the past.  \u0026ldquoOur mission is to inspire a nation to love the game and having a home that we can call our own is an important part of that. It will enable us to drive investment into the game and give us the best chance to improve football in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWhile we are now committed to Hampden Park we also recognise that it needs to change. We have heard the fans\u0026rsquo views throughout the process and agree with them that we need to improve access, transport links and the overall experience. We are committed to doing that.  \u0026ldquoWith all the commitments that have been made to the Scottish FA and Hampden Park Limited throughout this process, taking ownership of the Hampden Park site will create the potential to transform the home of Scottish football for the benefit of Scottish football fans. Ownership really will change the game. We look forward to working with all interested parties to achieve an exciting and fan-friendly vision for Hampden Park.  \u0026ldquoWith that in mind, we need all of Scotland to pull together to make it Scotland\u0026rsquos national stadium. We have heard many voice their support for the stadium. We need collective action, driven by the Scottish FA, to ensure it remains the beating heart of Scottish football."},{"url":null,"title":"ineos-in-60m-grangemouth-expansion","story":"  An extra furnace will be built on its ethylene plant at the site in Scotland.

This compares to 32% in England.  The \u0027State of Maternity Services\u0027 report found that 51% of pregnant women in Scotland in 2017 were obese or overweight, the first time the proportion has exceeded 50%.  This puts them at greater risk of gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and premature birth.  Meanwhile, a total of 158 babies were born to women aged over 45 last year - the highest number to date, and up from 29 in 2000. The number of births to women aged 40 to 44 has increased 68% over the same period.

At the same time, the vacancy rate for midwives has increased from 1.3% in September 2013 to 5% in March 2018 - equivalent to 127 empty posts.  Recruitment problems are toughest in Grampian, Highland and the Western Isles.  Looming retirements were also highlighted, particularly in the context of the redesign of Scotland\u0027s maternity services following the Best Start review which will see mothers allocated a named midwife for all their pregnancy, labour and postnatal care.  It could see a shift away from fixed shifts to an \u0027on-call\u0027 model that would see midwives responding whenever a mother on their caseload went into labour.  The report states: \"This model of care has strong evidence of benefits for women, families and, potentially, for midwives.  \"However, the introduction of such a significantly different way of working also brings with it uncertainties for the future workforce.  \"Some older midwives may choose to retire rather than take on a new way of working and it is also not yet clear whether the new model of care will require more midwives.  \"The impact of the implementation of the Best Start review recommendations on the workforce will start to be seen over the next one to two years.\"  Read more: Only two in 300 mothers in Scotland having a home birth  However, the report praised the Scottish Government for maintaining bursaries and free tuition for student midwives at a time whether they have been axed in England and fees imposed for the first time.

Mary Ross-Davie, RCM director for Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThere are some great things happening in our maternity services in Scotland, not least the very ambitious Best Start maternity programme.  \"The Scottish Government has also delivered real increases in the number of student midwives, which we welcome.  \u0026ldquoHowever, pressures on our midwives are increasing \u0026ndash the care needs of the women in our care are rising, while the number of unfilled midwifery posts is also rising.

Mr Cortes has written to the Train Operating Companies, including ScotRail, and to Network Rail seeking assurances they will not support Mr Grayling\u0027s move to impose pay rises which fell below the normal Retail Price Index, which, he argued, would be an effective pay cut.  Noting how morale among overworked rail staff was low, the union chief said they were furious with the Secretary of State\u0026rsquos plan.  \u0026ldquoUnless he backs off or, better still, is booted out, industrial action including strikes this coming winter loom large, declared Mr Cortes.  He said the TSSA union would seek support from Congress to send a message to \u0026ldquothis dysfunctional Tory government, that if they try to take on rail workers, the full weight of the Trades Union movement will be behind them as they bring our railways to a halt this winter to hold Chris Grayling and this lamentable government to account\".  Mr McDonnell, whose keynote speech to Congress pledged to give workers in the gig economy the same rights as other employees, including sick pay and parental leave, said he recognised there was \u0026ldquoreal anger among rail workers.  Asked if industrial action was something he would support, the Shadow Chancellor replied: \u0026ldquoWe will see what industrial action takes place.

The ex-minister declined to answer questions from journalists but used a Q\u0026ampA session at the end of the report launch to make a statement himself.  He said leaving the EU while continuing to accept the single market legislation would expose businesses to rules that may go against their interests.  \"That seems to me to be a particular economic risk in Chequers and makes it substantially worse than the status quo,\" he said.  The ERG will be unveiling its own alternative plan for tackling the Irish border issue on Wednesday.  The group has faced criticism from opponents who say it has attacked the Government\u0027s plans without coming up with one of its own on one of the main sticking points in discussions between Brussels and the Government."},{"url":null,"title":"major-advice-centre-brings-in-four-day-week-for-staff","story":"  Advice Direct Scotland has ensured all 68 members of staff in Glasgow and Stornoway will work fewer hours while receiving the same wages as before.  The moves comes as Frances O\u0026rsquoGrady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress , calls for a four-day week which would allow workers to share in the wealth generated by technological advances.  Advice Direct Scotland is a charity that provides free advice and information on a range of subjects including benefits, debt, money worries and consumer issues.  It delivers a full citizens advice service over the phone and online, through live chat, email and social media.  This week, the TUC is calling for people to work fewer hours, with around 1.4 million people thought to be working seven days every week.  David Rutherford, quality and compliance manager at Advice Direct Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a major first step by a large and growing organisation to introduce a four-day working week, and everyone is very confident it will increase productivity and reduce absenteeism.  \u0026ldquoAdvice Direct Scotland is a modern consumer-facing employer, and we want all workers to be positive about their job and look forward to coming to work.  \u0026ldquoToo many people across Scotland and the UK are working excessively long hours, and that\u0026rsquos not good for society.  \u0026ldquoThe four-day working week has given staff more time to do what they love. I used my extra day off to take my six-month-old son swimming and go to one of his dentist appointments for the first time. Everyone in the office is sharing stories about what they did on their day off. It\u0026rsquos created a really positive atmosphere, and everyone loves the better work-life balance.  Research by the TUC found that four out of five employees want to cut their working hours without losing any pay as new technology makes work more efficient.  The TUC believes moves should be put in place to try to cut the working week to four days over the course of this century.  In her to the TUC congress this week, Ms O\u0026rsquoGrady accused employers of making staff work unpredictable or unsocial hours because of an \u0026ldquoalways on culture.  The general secretary said: \u0026ldquoBosses and shareholders must not be allowed to hoover up all the gains from new technology for themselves.  \u0026ldquoWorking people deserve their fair share \u0026ndash and that means using the gains from new technology to raise pay and allow more time with their families."},{"url":null,"title":"birthday celebration for charity knitter iris","story":"        A Rothienorman woman who knits items for charity is preparing to celebrate her 98th birthday.

The project provides hand crafted clothing to new mothers in Africa.        The ‘Fish \u0026amp Chip Babies’ project was set up after it was discovered that newborns were wrapped in newspaper to keep them warm if no articles of clothing were available.Knitters across the UK, including Iris, decided to take action and have since knitted ious pieces of clothing to help the youngsters.Iris currently makes jumpers and matching hats for the project.She used to make booties but found them to be very time consuming.

Around 70 representatives from businesses in the east of Aberdeenshire attended the agri-tourism event at Fyvie Castle, where delegates had the opportunity to hear from speakers about current industry trends and network with tourism businesses locally.                                                    In Aberdeenshire, 65% of the population is based rurally – which highlights the wealth of opportunity that exists to continue to build, expand and be entrepreneurial with rural links, to continue to attract visitors to our part of Scotland. Nationally, the value of domestic visitor spend in rural areas amounts to £633 million and equates to 2.6 million domestic trips.                                                    Chris Greenwood, VisitScotland’s Senior Tourism Insights Manager, spoke to delegates about agricultural and rural tourism insights and the impacts and benefits for Aberdeenshire and Chris Foy, Chief Executive at VisitAberdeenshire presented the new destination strategy for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, detailing how they hope to grow visitor spend to £1 billion per year by 2023.        A new plan to develop food and drink tourism in Scotland – aiming to deliver an additional £1 billion to Scotland’s economy by 2030 – was recently launched by Nicola Sturgeon. At the event, Peter Cook, Director of Food, Drink and Agriculture at Opportunity North East, updated those attending about Opportunity North East’s work within that sector.Jo Robinson, VisitScotland Regional Director, said: “I am delighted that representatives from so many businesses in East Aberdeenshire attended this event, which hopefully gave them real food for thought on the subject of rural tourism.“This region has tremendous assets and strengths that offer visitors a range of great experiences – from food and drink to farm shops, coasts to castles and woods to wigwams. VisitScotland helps to promote these strengths to a global audience.“With 21% of domestic visitor trips being to rural areas and 22% of domestic visitor spend being in rural areas, capitalising on these visitors is so important. Hopefully events like this can help rural businesses to make the most of these opportunities.”                                                                                                        Gillian Martin, Aberdeenshire East MSP, said: “We have one of the most diverse regions in Scotland with an abundance of historical and cultural significance and interest. There is so much to do and see in rural parts and right across Aberdeenshire and we must do all we can to maximise the opportunities for tourism and economic growth by attracting new visitors to the North-east.”Chris Foy, VisitAberdeenshire Chief Executive, added: “The event reflected the importance of rural tourism for the North-east which is a significant priority set within the destination strategy for the next five years.“It is encouraging to see the strong desire from local industry to work alongside VisitScotland and VisitAberdeenshire to strengthen the appeal of the destination to visitors, and the quality of the experience.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeenshire man s life saving call on honeymoon","story":"        Nick and Philippa Allan got married last August and just a week later received a call that changed their lives.

The campaign is being fronted by ordinary Scots, like Gordon Hutchinson who underwent a life-saving transplant, aged just 13.      \t         “I called and was told I needed to get down to Edinburgh right away.”It was a call Nick had waited two and a half years to receive. He was born with a kidney condition that meant neither of his organs worked properly.                                                                                                         He underwent surgery at 18 months old and then went for regular checkups to monitor how his kidneys were functioning.  At a routine appointment in October 2014, doctors delivered the news that his kidneys were failing and Nick started dialysis shortly after.He said: “I’d lived with the condition all my life so hearing that I’d need treatment was a shock. “The doctor told me I’d be lucky to make it to Christmas without being on dialysis but I held on until February 2015.                                                                                                        “By the time I went on dialysis, my kidney function had dropped to eight per cent. I thought I was okay but looking back I was constantly tired and agitated. Things were a bit of a struggle.”Nick was determined the dialysis would not take over his life and kept working throughout.He said: “I was team leader at that time for an oil company – in charge of the onshore group.“I was determined to keep on working and have as normal a life as possible but it meant doing dialysis every night after work.“I’d leave home at 7am and not get back until 10pm or 10.30pm every day                                                                                                         “Dialysis was hard. I felt like my life had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some difficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new life.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the difference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gift that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a life free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gift – enjoying life to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive difference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new life basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gift.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my life and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gift.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"scottish tradesmen it s your call to help children","story":"        Protecting children does not just fall to the police, social workers and professionals who work with them.

/                   \t      \t\tProtecting children...in the average primary class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect. The NSPCC\u0027s Childline is on call 24 hours a day to help children who need help.\u0027\u0027      \t         Matt Forde, the national head of NSPCC Scotland, said: “We’re not asking people to spy on families. “But when they see something, in their heart of hearts, they know isn’t right, we’re asking them to report it so that those families can get the help they need.                                                                                                        “The online course both informs and educates about the signs of abuse and neglect and what you should do if you have a gut feeling that something is not right.“We’re not trying to turn plumbers or builders into social workers.“But they do spend a lot of time in customers’ homes and it’s not an unlikely scenario that someone in that situation might gain an insight into a child’s life.“People are often unsure whether they should report it. We would ask them to look at it from the child’s point of view – or their own child’s.                                                                                                        “The police and children’s services are not in the business of getting involved, willy-nilly, when they don’t need to.“In the vast majority of cases, children are not removed from their homes but their families do get the help and support they need.“Often, parents have their own pressures and have lost sight of their child’s needs.“They’re overwhelmed with their own difficulties and have a strong instinct against asking for help.“It’s very often a burden that is lifted when they get a chance to talk about something they have been struggling with on their own for far too long.”                                                                                                        On the flip side of that coin are children who are in imminent danger.NSPCC Scotland asks the public to call its helpline – 0808 800 5000 – or the police immediately in the worst case scenarios.Last year in Scotland, the NSPCC’s helpline referred 2012 calls and emails to local agencies such as the police or children’s services.The majority were from people who were concerned a child was being neglected  followed by concerns about physical abuse , emotional abuse  and sexual abuse .Matt said: “There has been increased traffic to our helpline.“People are often unsure whether to report something – they really struggle with it.“By calling the helpline, they can talk through their concerns and decide whether it’s something that needs to be taken forward.“Our advice would be for people to consider if it was their child in that situation – better safe, than sorry.”As the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to deliver its services in Scotland, the It’s Your Call online course does cost £19 for individual tradesmen, with package deals also available for employers.But Matt is hopeful that it will become a success.He said: “It’s very early days for the It’s Your Call training but we are hoping individuals and employers will take it up.“We are not funded by the government – we raise all our own funding – so a fee is involved to cover the cost of delivering the training. “But we hope people will agree it’s a small price to pay to help children who are potentially being abused or neglected.“It’s about helping to give children a voice when they can’t speak out themselves.”NSPCC Scotland prides itself on providing a voice for children but is also keen that young people, of all ages, are able to make their own voices heard too.The charity holds special Speak Out, Stay Safe assemblies at primary schools in every local authority area in Scotland with that aim in mind.Matt added: “We help children understand what abuse is and what to do if they are affected.“We then go back two weeks later to find out what the children made of it and reinforce the message. “Children often come to Childline when they are aged 12 and above, talking about things that have happened to them for years.“So we wanted to deliver a programme for primary schools in the hope that children would start reporting issues earlier.“Teachers have been very positive about the programme as it’s a topic they often struggle with too.” The NSPCC is the leading children’s charity fighting to end child abuse and protect children at risk in the UK and Channel Islands. Voluntary donations make up around 90 per cent of its funding.Childline open 24 hours a dayThe NSPCC’s Childline service has two bases in Scotland, in Aberdeen and Glasgow.In 2017/18, Childline volunteers delivered almost 280,000 counselling sessions to children and young people across the UK on the phone and online. Based on the population of Aberdeenshire, it is estimated that volunteers delivered around 1800 counselling sessions to children living in that area last year alone.Some of them are going through the toughest times of their lives. They face issues such as mental/emotional health, family relationships and bullying. So it’s vital that they have somewhere to turn. Childline – 0800 11 11 and www.childline.org.uk – is there for them 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.On average, a child somewhere in the UK contacts Childline every 25 seconds.NSPCC Scotland’s Speak Out Stay Safe  service, which helps children learn how to recognise abuse, has now been delivered in the majority of our mainstream primary schools.Sadly, in the average primary school class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect.Just £4 pays for a child’s call or contact with Childline and £3 pays for the SOSS programme to reach a child. But the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to provide its services across the UK and volunteers to help deliver them.To find out how you can help the charity or to make a donation, visit the website https:www.nspcc.org.uk/what-you-can-do.

September has a high rate of babies being born.\u0026ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low. Several experienced midwives are either retiring or leaving because of the added workload and the burden it is causing.Bill Fernie of the pressure group Caithness Health Action Team said he was not surprised that a midwife felt compelled to speak out.He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a terrible situation for the staff to find themselves in. They should be commended for all their efforts.\u0026ldquoTravelling to Raigmore places more than enough strain on the mums and their families so going to Glasgow would have added to that. I can fully understand why someone at Raigmore would want to whistle-blow as it appears to be a pretty fraught situation.An NHS Highland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoDue to the unpredictable nature of maternity activity, cases are assessed on an individual basis and robust risk assessment and escalation plans are in place to ensure safe service provision.\u0026ldquoTo date, since accepting intrapartum transfers from Elgin, there has been no need for any Caithness woman to be diverted from Raigmore Hospital to deliver elsewhere due to staffing levels or capacity, as is being suggested by the midwife whom you interviewed.Wednesday 12 Sep 2018 1:00 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classification of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn. A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo if only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked if they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot...

Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Wednesday 12 Sep 2018 1:00 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Wednesday 12 Sep 2018 1:00 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people. These include social work, police, education, the Scottish Children\u0026rsquos Reporter Administration and Children\u0026rsquos Hearings Scotland.No new panel member begins sitting on hearings without a thorough training being delivered beforehand. For any new Caithness trainees, the training takes place in Inverness.Panel member and trainer Christine Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt has been a great privilege to serve as a volunteer on the Children\u0026rsquos Panel for over 18 years and there are others residing within Caithness who have served for more than 20 years. Caithness Children\u0026rsquos Panel volunteers come from a wide iety of backgrounds and experiences \u0026ndash all walks of life make for a good blend.\u0026ldquoThe panel is always in need of new volunteers and, to that end, we are inviting any interested persons to our open evening, to take place at 7pm at the Children\u0026rsquos Panel Office, 23 Swanson Street, Thurso, on Tuesday, August 28. Please do consider coming along!\u0026ldquoThis is an information evening, where an overview of the voluntary work will be given, which will be followed by a question-and-answer session.\u0026ldquoThis is a great opportunity to find out more and to see if this is for you. Being a panel member is hugely rewarding \u0026ndash it is a great privilege to be able to come alongside families, young people and children in crisis and help them move forward constructively to a better future.\u0026ldquoIf you are interested in applying to become a panel member, please feel free to contact me for any further information. Also, you can check out the Children\u0026rsquos Panel website where you will find more information which should help you decide if volunteering for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel is really for you.Wednesday 12 Sep 2018 1:00 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Students get on their bikes in memory of friend","story":"THREE students got on their bikes at John O\u0026rsquoGroats earlier this week and pointed their compasses to Land\u0026rsquos End in a bid to raise awareness about mental health.Fenn Newsome, Giles Themans and Alex Hayton decided upon the marathon pedal following the death of their friend and fellow Newcastle University student, Marcus Colville.Marcus, from Exeter, had tragically taken his own life last December. He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the lengthy cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman. After talking with more team-mates who have opened up and described their own experiences the horrifying statistics become relatable.The cycling trio hope to be arriving at Land\u0026rsquos End in a fortnight\u0026rsquos time and are hoping to raise \u0026pound2000 for the Marcus in Mind fundraiser set up by his family.To make a donation, visit the website on: justgiving/crowdfunding/for-marcusWednesday 12 Sep 2018 1:00 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 11, 2018 at 4:18 pmThe junction at Wellington Street in Kirkwall connecting with Junction Road and New Scapa Road is to remain closed overnight, tonight, Tuesday, and into tomorrow.

This has made her challenge to find a way to climb the sea stack all the more unique and has presented a series of challenges in the planning stages.She will take on the climb in aid of the Calvert Trust, which supports people with disabilities through outdoor adventure.Asked why she had picked the Old Man of Hoy, Michelle laughed: \u0026#8220Because it\u0026#8217s the biggest sea stack going. I\u0026#8217d had the idea that I wanted to climb a sea stack before I was injured. It hadn\u0026#8217t really crossed my mind that I would ever be able to climb the old man of Hoy because it is notoriously difficult. I thought one day I would get it done but then I fell and I thought it\u0026#8217d never happen.\u0026#8220A friend came to me during rehab and said I needed to start setting myself goals and challenges but all my interests were based around climbing, which I didn\u0026#8217t think I could do anymore. It felt like that was totally ruled out – how can you climb without legs?\u0026#8220But they sent me some links to some really inspirational paraplegics, who were during climbing but in an adaptive way. Ordinarilly, climbing with two legs is like puzzle solving where you pick a route and decide what will work for you and that\u0026#8217s what I used to love.\u0026#8220When climbing in an adaptive way, you don\u0026#8217t get any of that puzzle solving and when people first spoke to me about climbing in that way I thought it wasn\u0026#8217t really the same so I wouldn\u0026#8217t want to do it. For me it was never about getting to the top of something, it was about the journey and figuring stuff out.\u0026#8220Climbing something in an adaptive way uses a pulley system and you haul your weight up. I thought there was no puzzle to that \u0026#8211 how wrong I was. I\u0026#8217ve not even attempted this climb yet and it\u0026#8217s been the biggest puzzle in the world. Creating the equipment has been the biggest challenge and finding people who have the ideas to make the equipment, it\u0026#8217s a never-ending puzzle.\u0026#8221To donate or find out more about Michelle\u0026#8217s challenge visit the website www.routetothesky\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Within the 12 weeks of attending Fair Start Scotland, not only can Alan now use Microsoft Outlook, but he has completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and has been applying online for employment.In all the group workshops that Alan attends, he socialises very well with the other participants and is very cheerful. He thinks the service is going very well, and is enjoying it. Alan is very happy with the progress he has made, and has noticed the improvement in his confidence.Alan seems to be talking so much more, which may have been a barrier stopping him from getting into work. He was pleased to inform his Fair Start Scotland adviser that he got a job working 15 hours a week.Alan said: “I’ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills at Lochaber Hope.

This year the entries will be narrowed down to 15 finalists who will discuss their ideas with the judges at the finals day on November 22.Last year\u0026rsquos top prize went to former Inverness College UHI student Paul Beaulieu , from Milton, Invergordon, who took home a cash prize of \u0026pound1500 and a combined legal and accountancy package worth \u0026pound2000 for an idea that could revolutionise how pipes are fabricated and fitted together.Dr Carol Langston, head of Create, said: \"Often people have a business idea, but they don\u0026rsquot know what to do with it, or who to turn to for help. That\u0026rsquos where Create comes in. We work with people to encourage them to be ambitious, bold and creative in their thinking, with the aim of encouraging innovation.\"Former winner Anna Renouf of Orrin Equestrian, is encouraging new entrants to take part in the competition.Since winning the most innovative business idea and the best engineering and technology award in 2015, she has gone on to win \u0026pound10,000 from Scottish Edge and received a Smart Scotland feasibility grant, which has allowed her to focus on the development of her innovative saddle design.Anna said: \"The University of the Highlands and Islands Business Competition represented the start of my business journey and it really gave me the confidence to take my idea forward and develop it further.\"Even now, I regularly seek advice and guidance from the Create team about the direction of my business.

When the kirk on the shores of Lochbroom was put up for sale by the Church of Scotland back in 2016, it\u0026rsquos future looked uncertain.A determined local fundraising drive saw it eventually taken into community ownership by locals who see it as a key hub in the beautiful, remote area.Celia said: \"We saw how well Donnie Mackenzie\u0026rsquos fundraiser for Clachan did and the huge boost it gave everyone involved. Sara and I thought we would enjoy getting fitter, seeing more of our country, and help Clachan at the same time. Since our local Trust became owners on June 22 we straightaway saw the difference it has made to our community. It has become a community focus right from the start.\"With the doors open more often we know there\u0026rsquos someone there and stop for a chat. For those of us living on the no-through road on the west shore of Loch Broom, we pass Clachan every time we go anywhere so it is ideal.\"\"When Clachan opened during the Lochbroom Sheepdog Trials, the trust displayed some local produce, from handloom weaving, cards, honey, handmade books and paintings, to show the range of economic activity in Lochbroom. That is the tip of the iceberg. There\u0026rsquos only a small population but there\u0026rsquos a huge number of people producing high-quality goods \u0026ndash having their work displayed in a public building helps everybody.\"Sara and I are confident that Clachan will be an asset to the Lochbroom community for many years to come so we are asking for sponsorship. This can be done at the New Broom hub in Ullapool and by emailing me at celiajcharity@me. Thank you.\"Kenneth Macleod, an interim trustee of Clachan Lochbroom Heritage Trust, said: \"I have seen the benefit that grows from rescuing a building, improving it and making it available for wider purposes. Of course Clachan continues for the usual church occasions \u0026ndash we want everyone to know that! \u0026ndash whilst extending its usefulness for other appropriate purposes.\"Wednesday 12 Sep 2018 1:01 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Delivering his \u0027State of the Union\u0027 address in Strasbourg on Wednesday morning, the Commission President underlined the EU\u0027s rejection of any plan that breaks up the key components of the single market, which guarantees freedom of movement for goods, services, people and capital.            His comments come as it was revealed that Brexiteers in the Prime Minister\u0027s party had stepped up their campaign to oust Mrs May, holding open discussions about a leadership coup at a meeting on Tuesday night if the government does not abandon the Chequers plan.

The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the life of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4798577.1536746876!/image/image.jpg","title":"hurricane florence residents flee as category 4 storm heads for us coast","story":"        Millions of Americans are preparing for what could be one of the most catastrophic hurricanes to hit the eastern seaboard in decades.                Hurricane Florence’s top winds dipped to 130mph on yesterday, but it remains a Category 4 storm and is expected to approach Category 5 status as it slows and strengthens over warm water off the coast of North and South Carolina.            The centre of the storm is forecast to meander tomorrow, Friday and Saturday over a stretch of coastline saturated by rising seas, inundating several states with rainfall and triggering life-threatening floods.            “Please be prepared, be careful and be SAFE!” US president Donald Trump tweeted.Mandatory evacuations are under way for parts of three east coast states, and the mayor of Washington DC declared a state of emergency as the US capital prepares for heavy rain and flooding.South Carolina’s governor ordered the evacuation of the state’s entire coastline yesterday and predicted that a million people would flee as major roads reverse directions.Virginia’s governor ordered a mandatory evacuation for some residents of low-lying coastal areas, while some coastal counties in North Carolina have done the same.North Carolina governor Roy Cooper said his state is “in the bullseye” and urged people to “get ready now”.            The centre of that bullseye may be Camp Lejeune, a sprawling Marine Corps training base. Forecast predict 20 inches of rain or more falling there, part of a wide stretch of rainfall that could see ten inches or more over much of Virginia and drench the nation’s capital. Some isolated areas could get 30 inches, forecasters said.Florence could hit the Carolinas harder than any hurricane since Hazel packed 130mph winds in 1954.That Category 4 storm destroyed 15,000 buildings and killed 19 people in North Carolina. In the six decades since then, many thousands of people have moved to the coast.The storm’s first effects were already apparent on barrier islands as dangerous rip currents hit beaches and seawater flowed over a state highway – the harbinger of a storm surge that could wipe out dunes and submerge entire communities. Watches are already in effect for a storm surge that could reach up to 12ft at high tide on a stretch from Cape Fear to Cape Lookout in North Carolina, forecasters said.            A hurricane watch was in effect for Edisto Beach, South Carolina, to Virginia’s southern border, with the first hurricane-force winds arriving late tomorrow.If Florence slows to a crawl just off the coast, it could bring torrential rain all the way into the Appalachian mountains and as far away as West Virginia, causing flash floods, mudslides and other dangerous conditions in places that do not usually get much tropical weather.Craig Fugate, former director of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, said: “This is going to produce heavy rainfall, and it may not move very fast. The threat will be inland, so I’m afraid, based on my experience at Fema, that the public is probably not as prepared as everybody would like.”National Hurricane Centre director Ken Graham warned that Florence is expected to linger once onshore, downing trees, knocking out electricity and causing widespread flooding.Mr Graham warned that the “staggering” size of the storm means its impacts will be felt far and wide.            The storm’s potential path also includes half a dozen nuclear power plants, pits holding coal-ash and other industrial waste, and numerous pig farms that store animal waste in massive open-air lagoons."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion.

Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

It was this love of numeracy that led Timothy to establish Maths Improvement NI, a programme to support good practice in the teaching of maths. This was disseminated throughout schools in Northern Ireland with great success.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTimothy had a love for children and had their best interests at heart. He was able to engage easily with his pupils and use his talents to help them reach their potential. His sense of humour and fun was shared and enjoyed by the children of St Mary’s. Timothy instilled in his pupils many of the values that he held dear respect, good manners, fairness, courtesy and decency, to name a few!\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTimothy was an avid supporter of Gaelic Games. He was an enthusiastic GAA coach in St Mary’s and loved the success his teams achieved at school and county level. Alongside Clann Na Banna, he established the “Gaelic League” in 1991 and its legacy continues today. Due to his influence and encouragement, many were attracted to Gaelic games, who otherwise may not have been.\n\nTimothy left a lasting impression upon all those who made his acquaintance, in both his personal and professional life. He was a true gentleman with a kind and caring heart and had the talent of making others feel at ease. Timothy made time for everyone and was undoubtedly the ‘life and soul’ of many a school outing and staff celebration. His presence will be greatly missed. His colleagues and friends cherish fond memories of the ‘yarns’ and ‘craic’ they shared. He was an inspiration to everyone and the school feels truly blessed to have know him: ‘You will be forever in our hearts.’ \n\n“He kept at true good humour’s mark, the social flow of pleasure’s tide. He never made a brow look dark, nor caused a tear, but when he died.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"call for botanic christmas lights","story":"\n\nBUSINESS\n owners on Botanic Avenue are calling for the extension of the city’s Christmas lights to the area to help tackle the yearly lull in winter trade.\nAs Christmas lights are erected in Belfast city centre, shoppers flock to the area for the winter festivities, making it the busiest time of year for most traders. However, on Botanic Avenue, which is especially popular with students, business owners begin to feel the pinch as the University term ends in December.\nRichard Walker, owner of The Other Place on Botanic’s thoroughfare, said that extending the Christmas lights would not only improve trade, but also the festive atmosphere in South Belfast.\n“Botanic Avenue is usually a very vibrant and busy area, but what we have discovered over the last couple of years is that when the Christmas lights are put up and the Christmas market comes that a lot of our customers want to go down into the city centre,” he said.\n“They want to be part of the buzz and the festivities. On Botanic Avenue we notice a lull in trade around that time.\n“We are very busy with the students returning around September up until November time. As soon as it gets close to Christmas time there is a massive downturn in trade.\n“People are going into the city centre because they want to be part of the fun. The economy is very poor at the minute and a lot of restaurants are really struggling so we rely on Christmas to help our performance throughout the year, because come January when everybody has spent their money eating out is the last thing they want to do. It puts us under a lot of pressure.”\nHe continued: “Festivals and events like the Christmas market are great for the local economy, but in Botanic Avenue and the Ormeau where we aren’t part of the city festive programme we see a drop in footfall.\n“With the tourist boom that we’ve had over the summer, we’ve seen that a lot of tourists are getting off the train at Botanic train station, and with the opening of the Grand Central Hotel, they are walking up Botanic Avenue, going to the Ulster Museum and Botanic Park. I would like that to be part of the route map for Christmas, so that we can keep that going.\n“I have spoken to a lot of local traders here and they are all very much of the same mindset. We want Botanic and Ormeau to be part of the Christmas spirit –It’s good craic. My staff would certainly like to be coming to work seeing the Christmas lights and getting into the spirit. I think it’s a good idea for local traders and the local residents too.”\nBotanic Councillor Declan Boyle said that bringing the festivities to the area is “great idea”.\n“The Christmas market is  good but I think we need to spread people out to other parts of the city too,” said.\n“The business owners pay rates and they should be given a bit of help and assistance. In Botanic Avenue their market, by and large, is university students and in the middle of December when they go it’s very quiet, so it would do no harm to help out those businesses there.\n“For the rest of the year it’s a thriving place, it has a great bohemian mix, so I think the area should be assisted in the Christmas months. It’s only a small stretch of road, and it wouldn’t have a terrible expense attached to it, so I would be very much in favour of it.”\n________________________________________\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"dont deport us back to iraq","story":"\nTWO junior Iraqi doctors who fled their war-torn nation due to death threats made to one of their lives, say they hope the Home Office will reconsider its decision to imminently deport them due to complications with their visa.\n\nSpeaking from their home off Lisburn Road’s Chadwick Street, Yosra Taleb Abdalla who shares the property with her husband Usamah Ather Ali and two young children – one of whom is aged just 20 months –  explained how she and Ali had been working as junior doctors when Ali, who worked for the Ministry for Defence in Baghdad, received a threat to his life. \n\n“We applied for a visa to Dublin and then went onto Belfast,” said Yosra. “We have been here nearly three years, from the beginning of January 2016.”\n\nYosra continued: “The people here have been extremely kind to us and the children enjoy the multicultural side of life.\n\n“We feel safe here, we are safe here we feel that no-one can hurt us here.”\n\nYosra explained how the Home Office decision, which was made in late July, refused the family’s submission for asylum and to date the family have received no further correspondence as to when they have to leave the country.\n\nAs both Yosra and Ali have not successfully secured asylum neither can work, leaving the family in limbo.\n\n“We fear we will forget all we have learned in our profession,” said Yosra. “It is our hope to work.\n\n“We were doctors in our home country, we were living a normal life, and now we are here trying to live our lives. We don’t know what to expect from the future. Our  youngest is only 20 months old and our son is going to be four in November.\n\n “We want a chance to prove ourselves and return to our normal life as we are very frustrated with the way things are and for our young family. It is a extremely stressful time for us and we would ask the Home Office for further reconsideration.”\n\nSouth Belfast MLA Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, who has been supporting the family, said he would be asking the Home Office to look again at their case and allow the young family to remain in the city where they have been embraced by the local community.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “Each asylum application is carefully considered on its merits against background country information to ensure that only genuine claims are granted.\n\n“Where a decision has been made that a person does not require international protection, and there are no remaining rights of appeal or obstacles to their return, we expect individuals to return voluntarily to their home country.\n\n“The Home Office\u0026#8217s full range of country policy and information notes  is available at https:www.gov.uk/government/collections/country-information-and-guidance.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"summers bountiful harvest is celebrated in colin","story":"\n\n\nTHE strong green-fingered growers at Colin Allotments celebrated a successful end of summer harvest on Thursday by sharing the bountiful fruits  of their labour with the local community.\nThe Colin Harvest Festival brought people from all over the community together for the celebration. Visitors were treated to displays from traditional musicians, the Colin Men’s Shed, Belfast Beekeeper’s Association, and, of course, the gardeners themselves.\nThis year’s harvest produced a colourful cornucopia of fruit and veg – a beautiful, healthy and tasty reward for all of the allotment owners’ hard graft.\nMichael George, from Colin Neighbourhood Partnership, hailed their success, stating it was “the best year yet” for the allotments.\n“This is all great produce from the allotment holders themselves and we have local honey from the hives on site,” he said.\n“We have all of these different organisations here giving advice and information about growing and sustainable living.\n“This is a very important project for the Colin area because it’s helping local people grow their own vegetables, and stay healthy. We want to promote sustainable living. With Brexit coming along, fruit and vegetables are getting dearer every day.\n“I have a plot here myself and I’ve eaten the vegetables from the plot all summer. It’s a money saver, it’s organic, you can taste the difference and it keeps you healthy too.”\nHe continued: “I couldn’t get over the displays. The last couple of years have been good, but this is the best year yet. The community are really into it – it’s a great celebration.”\nBelfast’s first citizen, Cllr Deirdre Hargey, who came along to judge the stunning displays, said: “It’s a brilliant day. When you’re up here and you see the scale of the allotments in the Colin area it’s amazing. It’s brilliant for the city, it’s brilliant for the community and our young people.\n“It teaches people to grow their own food – healthier food, more natural food – and encouraging people to actually eat fruit and veg.\n“You can see that the demand for this community activity is growing too.\n“It’s particularly important when you look at the health issues in the city relating to diet including obesity. This helps change the culture of unhealthy eating.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the community group that took on a giant","story":"\n\nMONEY\n breeds power, or so the idiom goes, but five years ago when plans were revealed for a quarter-billion pound waste incinerator in Glengormley, it sparked a grassroots community campaign that would go on to take on big capital and even the government.\nThe NoArc21 campaign started when a small group of concerned residents called a public meeting to voice their concerns about Becon Consortium’s plans to build an incinerator near homes on the Hightown Road.\nVice-chair of NoArc21, Charlie Thompson, said the danger posed by the incinerator and the anger caused by it was enough to mobilise the community.\n“The anger was bad because at that stage there was problems with the dump in Mallusk and the smells coming from the incinerator down there,” he said.\n“This area was very much seen as a dumping ground. It was like we were living in the middle of a tip. The actual incinerator would be right outside my windows. I would be looking at it every day if it was to go ahead.\n“We were told lies about the size of it too. We were told it would be all hidden and that we wouldn’t even notice it. This thing is going to be the size of Wembley Stadium or Croke Park and it’s supposed to be less than a half a mile from my front windows – I think I would see the thing.\n“I was very angry at the size and scale of it, but there is evidence out there now that these things cause cancer. The size can’t be underestimated either – it will be the single biggest freestanding building in Northern Ireland.\n“It will have a chimney stack that’s over 90 metres long. The evidence all says anyone living up to a kilometre-and-a-half away will be those worse affected. This thing is going to be pouring toxins over my family, my neighbours and everybody within a kilometre at best, but at worse the catchment area could be 15k. Almost all of the Belfast basin will be inhaling this and it’s already one of the most polluted cities in Europe, in terms of air pollution. This is just going to make it worse.”\nHe continued: “As soon as I got involved there was a small committee set up and we identified all the problems that could be associated with it.\n“After the waste is burned there is a substance left over called fly-ash, which is extremely toxic. If any of the lorries carrying it were involved in an accident, and this is a busy road, then all of that would be released into the air.\n“This is in an expanding residential area. The impact on that is huge.\n“We have evidence as well that it would reduce house prices. We estimated that it would reduce house prices by ten to 20 per cent, but we now have people who have come forward who can’t get a mortgage on their homes because there is a negative equity risk.\n“The evidence is very, very clear this causes lung infections, cancers, and lung conditions. While the incinerator complies with existing legal policies and regulations, they have never ever said it was safe.\n“Any opportunity I have had with Arc21 I have asked them if they could stand up in front of the public and say that the facility is safe. They have never said that – they have said it complies with existing policies and regulations, but those are already out of date, and are being reviewed as we speak.”\nWhile the anger amongst residents was palpable during the foundation of the NoArc21 campaign, Charlie said that channelling those energies and sustaining the group has been “extremely tough”.\n“Because of the threat it was easy at times to get people on board, but the issue is sustaining the campaign,” he explained.\n“We had a problem with apathy. When Mark H Durkan was environment minister he shot dead the application, and people thought it was dead in the water. We then had to go to the Planning Appeals Commission and we lost.\n“That said, in the history of Northern Ireland this has had the most objections to any planning application – over 4,000 people have gone to the trouble of submitting an objection.\n“The other thing that has helped us is that we are cross-community. We have been approached by all parties who have offered us assistance, but we have been very careful that we don’t side with one over another. Our group is mixed in terms of background. It doesn’t just impact on any one side of the community. This has been key to us.\n“We have secured funding through online crowdfunding, and people have been very good on that, people have thrown money in buckets for us – it all helps.”\nBy being able to recruit a legal team, NoArc21 were able to challenge the legality of the decision to grant planning permission for the incinerator earlier this year. The High Court ruled the Department for Infrastructure did not have the authority to grant permission in the absence of a minister. Charlie said that the group were “happy and shocked” by the decision, but said that they still might have a fight on their hands.\n“We’re a small community group, so this is all new to us,” he stated.\n“We didn’t think for a minute that we would win – we were hoping that we would win and we were fighting from every angle. We pulled in experts who were offering free advice and services.\n“When we heard the High Court Ruling we were delighted. We had a very strong legal team, but we were still very surprised. We always knew that this facility was wrong in this area.\n“Fighting it legally for us was a big challenge for us and we may have to do it again. The Department for Infrastructure won’t appeal, but the Attorney General submitted a series of questions that could affect the High Court decision.\n“I’m not going to say that we didn’t expect the decision to have huge ramifications, but we didn’t think that it would stall the governing of Northern Ireland. There are so many things that are held up because of this. With the Attorney General submitting those questions, there’s a chance that this will go to the Supreme Court in London, and that’s something that we have to prepare for.”\nHe added: “We are optimistic, however, if we lose on one issue this could be enough to put this back to a decision for a minister to take, whether that be a direct rule minister, or if Stormont is back up and running.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"reesmogg i have a brexit plan for northern ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They included a priest attending to those wounded and a mother of eight.\n\nIn the documentary it heard how that mother, Joan Connolly, lay crying on the ground until she passed away.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing the 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nInquests into the deaths are due to open in November.\n\n\n \nDate set for new inquest into Ballymurphy massacre\n \n\n\nFilmmaker Callum Macrae, rejected criticism the piece did not tell \"the whole story\" in that it did not go into the context of the major gun battles around the time or give the \"full context\" about the actions of paramilitaries including the IRA at the time.\n\nHe said: \"The description - which is widely held by people in the UK - that Protestants and Catholics were at each others throats, the Provisional IRA was an incredibly dangerous force rushing around killing people and the British Army was sent in as the patsies, the guys in the middle, trying to restore order and peace - that is the official narrative, it is accepted by almost everybody in Britain - and it is simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast IRA men with a drogue bomb in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I tell people the Provisional IRA did not exist until several months after the Army arrived, they are astonished. Because there is a false narrative. \n\n\"So to describe what I am doing as some kind of false unbalanced narrative is just simply wrong.\n\n\"My film actually is the balance to the official narrative which is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nMr Macrae said \"of course the IRA\" were active at the time of the Ballymurphy massacre. \n\n\"The British Army described very clearly a \u0027major gun battle\u0027, with upwards of 700 rounds being fired at soldiers. The Army, specifically in a statement to the Belfast , claimed there were 20 gunmen coming down from the top of the hill onto the Whiterock Road and the Army fought a two-hour battle involving Thompson sub-machine guns, pistols and rifles.\"\n\nHe said the reports from the time - based on what the British Army had said happened - although \"well-intentioned\" were \"transparently untrue\".\n\n\"They talk about wiping out a \u0027hardcore IRA unit\u0027,\" he went on.\n\n\"Now I have been looking into this for four years and there is not a shred of credible evidence I can find to say any of that is true.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me be clear - I am no apologist for the IRA. \n\n\"No one can say there was no IRA present - I am certainly not saying that. \n\n\"What we can say for sure is no one can say for certain there were no armed paramilitaries present. And we do mention the UVF claim.\n\n\"We said most of the IRA had been tipped off and most of their members had left, that\u0027s what the IRA claimed.\"\n\nQuoting Gerry Adams who claimed a \"small number\" of IRA remained to offer \"token resistance\", Mr Mccrae said there were no guns found, ammunition or shells and two of those killed had been shot in the back.\n\n\"Not for a second do I deny the IRA were there,\" he added.\n\n\"What the army claim is \u0027a large number of IRA were involved with sub machine guns\u0027.

road is in Belfast is the most clamped street or road in Northern Ireland, new figures have revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nDepartment for Infrastructure statistics show 16 vehicles were clamped on the Lisburn Road between the start of 2016 and the end of June this year.\n\nIt was almost double the number of clampings carried out on Chichester Street, Northern Ireland\u0027s second most clamped street.\n\nBotanic Avenue, Great Victoria Street, and King Street all had eight clampings each.\n\nBetween January 2016 and June of this year Northern Ireland\u0027s motorists paid out £34,581 to have clamps removed from their cars.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u0027s 10 most clamped roads and streets were all in the Belfast City Council area.\n\nIn 2016 there were 254 cars clamped in Northern Ireland, 305 cars were clamped in 2017, and 91 cars were clamped in the first six months of 2018.\n\nIn Northern Ireland there are two reasons to clamp a car.\n\nAction can be taken for an unpaid penalty charge notice, or against vehicles parked in urban clearways and bus lanes.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Infrastructure said clamping had been an effective measure to prevent traffic offences.\n\nClamping was introduced for cars parked in urban clearways and bus lanes on March 5.\n\nBetween that date and the end of June 35 cars were clamped and removed for that reason.\n\nThe rule was introduced to stop motorists blocking the main arteries into Belfast by parking illegally.\n\nEnforcement is carried out for the Department for Infrastructure by contractor NSL Services Group.\n\nDrivers are required to pay a charge of £40 to have a clamp removed if the car has been removed to a nearby street, or £105 if the car has been taken to the vehicle pound .\n\nSpeaking at the time of the launch of the measure, Ciaran de Burca, Department for Infrastructure director of transport projects, said: \"Vehicles parked in urban clearway routes and bus lanes during operational hours cause significant delays and congestion for commuters and other road users, particularly during the morning and evening peak traffic hours.\n\n\"For drivers who choose to ignore urban clearway and bus lane regulations, this specially designed enforcement vehicle will carry out the removal and clamping of illegally parked vehicles, leaving main routes unobstructed during these key times and allowing other road users to continue on their journeys without the unnecessary delay caused.\"\n\nEarlier this year the issue of clamping was in the headlines after footage emerged of Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly removing a clamp from his car, raising questions about the legality of clamping a vehicle in a private car park.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said clamping legislation had not been updated in Northern Ireland since the 1970s and differed substantially from other parts of the UK.\n\nClamping on private land in England and Wales became an offence in 2012 under the Protection of Freedom Act, with the same law having been in place in Scotland since 2002.\n\nHowever, it remains legal in Northern Ireland.\n\nCompanies here can still hire contractors to clamp private cars on their land, although companies able to do this must be licensed by the Security Industry Authority  and are regulated by the British Parking Authority.\n\nThe maximum fee private contractors can charge to free a car from a clamp in Northern Ireland is £100.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup advisers at odds over closure of botched green energy scheme","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC

Mr Cairns expressed regret that there was no written record.\n\n“With hindsight it is abundantly clear to me that we really should have just sat round the table, got everybody interested around the table, and got this thrashed out.\n\n“I was relying on phone calls and this shuttle diplomacy that really was deficient.\n\n“You have to be able to say that you did your best or, electorally, that is going to be a problem.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"final recommendations for northern ireland electoral boundary changes published","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Under the proposals, published on Monday, Northern Ireland will have 17 constituencies down one from the current 18.\n\n\n\nPlans to split a town into three voting zones dropped\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland electoral boundary changes - what constituency are you in?\n\n\n\nInteractive map: Northern Ireland electoral boundary changes\n \n\n\nThe changes would see two constituencies relatively unchanged, namely Foyle and Fermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone. There would be four new constituencies - Sperrin, Causeway, Mid Antrim and Mid Down.\n\n\nFlashback to 2017 General Election results: \n\nEast Belfast\n .... \nNorth Belfast \n\n\n.... \nSouth Belfast\n \n\n.... \nWest Belfast \n\n\n.... \nEast Antrim \n\n\n.... \nEast Londonderry \n\n\n.... \nFermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone\n \n\n.... \nFoyle \n\n\n.... \nLagan Valley \n \n\n.... \n\n\nMid Ulster \n \n\n.... \nNewry \u0026 Armagh \n\n\n.... \nNorth Antrim \n \n\n.... \nNorth Down\n \n\n.... \nSouth Antrim\n \n\n.... \nSouth Down\n \n\n.... \nStrangford \n \n\n.... \nUpper Bann  \n\n\n....\nWest Tyrone  \n\n\n....\n\nEleven remain with the same name, although their boundaries are altered. They are the four sets in Belfast, East Antrim, Mid Ulster, Newry and Armagh, North Down, South Antrim, South Down and Upper Bann.\n\nAnd effectively disappearing - because there would be no obvious successor in the new plans - would be North Antrim, Lagan Valley, Strangford, East Londonderry and West Tyrone.\n\nA previous proposal to reduce Belfast to three constituencies has disappeared.\n\nThe iations in the number of people living in each constituency would be reduced - meaning they would be closer in size in terms of people represented.\n\nCurrently the smallest constituency is East Antrim with 59,658 electors on December 2015, while the largest is Upper Bann with 80,218.\n\nUnder the Boundary Commission plans the smallest would become Upper Bann with 69,795 people eligible to vote and the largest, Mid Down, with 77,767.\n\n\n\nThe Boundary Commission has been working on the changes since 2013 and the final recommendations come after a large scale consultation process. Almost 10,000 petition signatures and letters were received by the organisation.\n\nThe matter will be put to parliament and debated before new legislation is put in place to enact the changes, if a vote approves the changes.\n\nDeputy Chair of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland, Madam Justice Denise McBride DBE, QC said: \"The Boundary Commission has determined its final recommendations after careful consideration of all the evidence collected during three stages of open and transparent public consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final recommendation proposes 17 constituencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Commission is grateful to all those who took the time and trouble to respond. We have sought, where possible, to try and accommodate the wide range of views and proposals presented whilst remaining within the constraint of the statutory criteria imposed upon the 2018 Review.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"laffertys delight after going a full year without gambling","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It\u0027s been one year today since the last time I placed a bet. I was in a dark place and lowest I\u0027ve ever been and to come out of it and celebrate this achievement is amazing and I\u0027ve never been happier. 365 days.\"\n\nAmong those wishing him well was his Northern Ireland team-mate Steven Davis who tweeted: \"Well done big man, keep up the good work.\"\n\nStuart Dallas added: \"Love that big man, keep it up\".\n\nLafferty, who recently moved back to Rangers after a stint at Hearts, admitted a gambling problem had cost him thousands of pounds around 18 months ago. He was found guilty of breaching FA gambling rules and was handed a £23,000 fine in August 2016. However, he has not placed a bet since September 11, 2017.\n\nThe Fermanagh man has said he \"lost big\" in the past and that his issues with gambling began after he made his 2008 switch from Burnley to Rangers.\n\nSpeaking last year, he said: \"About halfway through my contract with Rangers I didn\u0027t have anything better to do after training than go to the bookies or sit online. Betting on football had been banned and, if anything, things got worse.\n\n\"I\u0027d bet on horses instead.\"\n\nFormer GAA star McConville  battled his own gambling demons for 12 years before finally turning the corner and is now a highly-respected addiction counsellor.\n\nHe told the Belfast  last night: \"A day away from any addiction is a miracle and people in recovery will always say that it\u0027s about taking things one day at a time.\n\n\"The fact that Kyle has made those 365 days back-to-back is unbelievable.

It will give ordinary people a real voice on the future of social care – an issue that impacts us all, but especially those already most vulnerable. \n\n\"It’s such a complex and emotive topic that the space for careful deliberation on the values we want our social care system to embody is badly needed.\"\n\nIn recent years, the citizens\u0027 assembly in the Republic, known as the Constitutional Convention, has made recommendations which acted as a precursor to referendums on changing the Irish Constitution\u0027s stance on abortion and same-sex marriage. \n\nFunding for the event is provided by Building Change Trust, which gives backing to voluntary sector organisations in Northern Ireland, with £100,000 given to public-participation charity Involve to run the event. \n\nThe Citizens\u0027 Assembly will meet over two weekends at a hotel in Belfast on October 26-28 and November 16-18. \n\nIn a statement on the official Citizens\u0027 Assembly website, it says those taking part will be: \"taken through a facilitated process of learning, dialogue and deliberation. The process will be designed to ensure participants receive the evidence they require to make informed recommendations.\"\n\nParticipants will discuss Northern Ireland\u0027s social care system, looking at the roles that the health service, communities and individuals play in it. \n\n\"The output from this process will be realistic recommendations to bring the social care system into the 21st century, and future-proof it to cope with the needs of the next generations within the context of limited resources,\" the statement reads. \n\nAlthough it is hoped the Assembly will be a fresh democratic instrument, any recommendations it makes will be advisory and it has not legislative or statutory decision-making powers.  \n"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures rory mcilroys swanky florida pad on the market","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

That’s a very different world from the world I came from.” \n\nSince her admission last week the interview has inspired the #ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew on Twitter.\n\nFrom where the international airport is, or isn\u0027t, to how people across the divide take their tea, there has been all manner of hilarity.\n\n\"The Apprentice Boys are an exclusive club of trainee electricians, plumbers and joiners,\" joked one scamp.\n\n\"Makes Twitter worth it,\" said Alliance leader Naomi Long. \n\n\"We might have more than our fair share of problems but when it comes to dark humour and laughing at ourselves  we really excel,\" the MLA said. \n\n\"I\u0027m not particularly worried about Karen Bradley\u0027s lack of knowledge about here before she was appointed Secretary of State,\" said SDLP leader Colum Eastwood. \n\n\"I\u0027m very concerned about her lack of action since she arrived.\"\n\n\nThe Guddies are for wearing on your feet and not a 70s TV show starring Bill Oddie. \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— Marty Morgan  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nMost dogs in Northern Ireland are called Ormo because they\u0027re well bread \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— DaddyTayto  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nBobby Ewing was in the shower all the time... \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— Arvo McPart #FBPE #ABTV #Remain  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\nGordon Ramsay, Marco Pierre White and Jamie Oliver all hail from Cookstown.\n— Ryan  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nA dreary monday Morning brightened considerably by \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— Davy Sims  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n\nCatholics put green Milk in their cereal and Protestants put Blue Milk on theirs...\n— Slim™  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n \n\nMaze prison was actually a Maze and once prisoners found the exit they were allowed to leave.\n— Tim McCullagh  \nSeptember 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast International Airport isn\u0027t actually in Belfast \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— David McCann  \nSeptember 9, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Norris was in the RA \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— The_Flamming_Cahoot  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nIan Paisley was widely misunderstood When he called for an end to \u0027Popery\u0027 he was actually decrying the popular 1980\u0027s perfumed wooden shavings which many middle class women kept in an ornate dish in the living room. \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— Shirley Anne McMillan  \nSeptember 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Apprentice Boys are an exclusive club of trainee electricians, plumbers and joiners.\n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— TimesIwonder  \nSeptember 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n we still have to check under our cars for leprechauns \npic.twitter/zrpRnWxSR7\n\n— Julie Watson  \nSeptember 8, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\"...and I know it\u0027s famous for building the world\u0027s most famous ship - the Starship Enterprise.

Parties split on ERG blueprint\n \n\n\n\nIn a new paper, they propose the Government should agree equivalence of UK and EU regulations for the safety of agricultural products and allow EU inspectors into Northern Ireland to check on their implementation.\n\n\n\nThe EU will be able to maintain the integrity of its internal market without erecting a hard border along its border with Northern Ireland.\nEuropean Research Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland and the Republic would be maintained as a Common Biosecurity Zone after Brexit, allowing the smooth movement of these goods across the border.\n\n“Since UK and EU standards are identical and will remain identical at the point of departure, determining equivalence after Brexit should be straightforward,” said the document.\n\nFor other goods, the ERG said existing simplified customs procedures could continue to be used to avoid the need for checks at the border.\n\nLarger companies would use “trusted trader” schemes to clear their goods for export and import, and other declarations would be incorporated into the existing system used for VAT returns.\n\nThe ERG paper said that Brussels had made “a major error” in listening almost solely to the warnings of Leo Varadkar’s government in Dublin on the potential for the border issue to disrupt the peace process, contrasting his administration’s stance with the “co-operative and practical” approach of predecessor Enda Kenny.\n\nWarnings that manned checkpoints at the border would become a target for terrorists fail to recognise that checks are already conducted for tax, VAT, currency, excise duties and security without the need for any physical intervention at the border, said the group.\n\nThey cited customs chiefs from the UK and the Republic who have said they do not expect new infrastructure to be needed after Brexit.\n\nThey argued the Withdrawal Agreement proposals on the border are themselves a “clear breach” of the Good Friday Agreement, which requires decisions on the future of the border to remain a matter for the people of Northern Ireland.\n\n“The key obstacle in the negotiations is the EU’s concern that goods could enter into the Single Market area through the Irish border without being compliant with EU standards or tariffs,” said the ERG paper, launched in Westminster.\n\n“The question for the EU is whether this risk to the integrity of the Single Market is so serious that it could block a Free Trade Agreement with the UK.”\n\nAnd it added: “In the debate over solutions to the Northern Ireland border issue, a proper sense of scale, perspective or proportionality has been lost.\n\n“The EU’s objections are political not practical. The Government has failed to set out what can be done to provide for customs compliance without physical checks or infrastructure on the Northern Ireland border.”\n\nThe document said that, under the ERG’s proposals, “the EU will be able to maintain the integrity of its internal market without erecting a hard border along its border with Northern Ireland.\n\n“At the same time, the United Kingdom will be able to develop a fully independent trade policy rather than remaining a rule-taker.”\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg arrives at the Royal United Services Institute in Whitehall to discuss the group’s proposals \n\n\n\n\nAnd it added: “This allows the United Kingdom to conduct an independent trade policy without threatening the integrity of the EU single market.”\n\nThe ERG shrugged off the prospect of an open border in Ireland becoming a route for illegal immigration into the UK.\n\nIn practice, immigration is prevented not at the border, but by measures to make it difficult for illegals to obtain work, accommodation and welfare, said the paper.\n\nIn response to EU concerns that goods that do not meet its standards – like US genetically-modified crops and chlorine-washed chicken – might enter its markets via Northern Ireland, the ERG said that such breaches could be handled in the same way police on both sides of the border currently tackle smuggling of drugs, fuel or alcohol.\n\n“Law-enforcement agencies on both sides of the border co-operate to suppress smuggling without anyone suggesting that border posts and checks would make their efforts more effective,” said the ERG.\n\n“If they can tackle trade in drugs, fuel, tobacco and alcohol without infrastructure at the border, they can prevent non-compliant goods from the UK reaching Irish retail outlets in the same way.”\n\nThe ERG said its proposals could be delivered without weakening North-South co-operation.\n\n“There is nothing which would reduce our commitment to the Belfast Agreement, or which might jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland,” the group said.\n\n“Harnessing the latest developments in international best practice can deliver continued co-operation and prosperity in the best interests of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"anonymous fan donates goat to sunderland manager jack ross

Only five players attended a pre-season meeting and Down took the field for their National League opener with barely 15 players.\n\nHowever, Rooney\u0026rsquos infectious enthusiasm has transformed Down and three months later the girls find themselves preparing for an All-Ireland showdown.\n\nSport is such a conundrum. All who have been involved in sport at any level can testify to the many frustrating and heartbreaking defeats sporadically interrupted by moments of sheer elation.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos these infrequent moments that keep players and coaches going year in year out in search of just one more. A half, a game even a season can be changed on a block, tackle, score or win and the momentum gathered can be infectious.\u0026nbsp\n\nA group, seemingly going nowhere except deeper into the abyss are suddenly galvanised, working for one another as if their lives depended on it. Success is like a lightning bolt. It can strike when you least expect it and you must keep the energy and drive going. You have to strike when the iron is hot.\n\nYet, as we all know, fairy tale endings only become fairy tale endings when the underdog performs to their very best and leaves the field of play with no regrets.\n\nOn their day the Down girls are a match for anyone as they have proved a number of times this year and they have also shown that when their backs are against the wall they can and have turned games around.\u0026nbsp\n\nDown have talented players all over the park. They will be led by Clonduff sisters Sara Louise and Fionnuala Carr, who were both on the side that won the All-Ireland Junior crown at Croke Park in 2014.\n\nThrow in in Bredagh\u0026rsquos Catherine Rocks, Liatroim\u0026rsquos Aimee McAleenan and Dearbhla Magee and you have the nucleus of an attack-minded side.\u0026nbsp\n\nHowever, Portaferry\u0026rsquos twin terrors Niamh Mallon \u0026mdash skipper of the 2014 side \u0026mdash and Saoirse Sands are the jewels in the Down crown and they have the potential to cut any defence to shreds and no better place to do that than Croke Park on Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of raised eyebrows when Down got the better of Tipperary thanks to a 58th minute goal from Sara Louise Carr to reach the Liberty Insurance All-Ireland Intermediate final for the first time in 20 years.\n\nIt may have been a surprise, but there were indications that the Mourne girls were making real progress as the summer evolved.\n\nAdmittedly, the league was a disaster, as they lost all five outings, but then they got the better of Derry in the Ulster final. They followed that up with a draw against the much-fancied Oak Leafers in the opening round of the All-Ireland Championship.\n\nThat laid the platform for the rest of the campaign and they defeated Laois to bag the runners-up spot in Group 1 behind Cork, who had overcome all before them.\n\nTipperary topped Group 2 and were six points clear at half-time in the semi-final, but with the experiment of deploying Fionnuala Carr at full forward dispensed with, there was an immediate improvement as the Clonduff colossus began to exert greater influence from centre back. Nicole Kelly put the shackles on the dangerous Nicola Treacy too.\n\nMeanwhile, Niamh Mallon was busily keeping the umpire busy as she racked up nine points, seven from placed balls. That brought Down in touch and Sara Louise Carr, who got married earlier this year, pounced for the definitive goal to go with her earlier two points from play.\n\nCork will be desperate to get over the line having lost the last two deciders, including last year\u0026rsquos to Meath after a replay.\u0026nbsp\n\nMuch like their senior counterparts, they have cruised through to the final, finishing the group phase with a positive scoring differential of 65 points, compared to Down\u0026rsquos -2. Indeed, the Rebels were 12-point victors when the teams met in P\u0026aacuteirc Esler in July.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe Leesiders possess a lot of firepower with Finola Neville, Caroline Sugrue and Katelyn Hickey well able to hit the target. Minor star Cliona Healy came off the bench to have a big impact in the semi-final win over Galway, scoring three points in as many minutes soon after her second-half introduction to edge the Leesiders clear and finishing with four.\n\nHealy wasn\u0026rsquot involved when the Leesiders garnered the Division 2 League title, but she and a handful of other colleagues from the All-Ireland-winning Minor Championship side have made the step up and with that sort of ability to be called upon, they will be hard to beat.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Arts Centre launches new programme  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWN Arts Centre has announced its latest arts programme.\n\nThe new-look autumn guide, covering September to December, is brimming with a huge range of exhibitions, music, theatre, comedy, talks, classes and workshops.\n\nA ied season of live performances gets off to a comedic start with Owen O\u0026rsquoNeill\u0026rsquos new one man play, \u0026lsquoTen Songs To Die For\u0026rsquo.\u0026nbsp Also billed for the autumn are local comedians Shane Todd with his hilarious brand new stand-up show \u0026lsquoHero\u0026rsquo and Kevin McAleer \u0026mdash a comedy apparition not to be missed.\n\nMusical highlights include celtic and country classics including the Leading Ladies, charismatic singer songwriter Grainne Duffy and the ever popular Illegals with Niamh Kavanagh.\n\nNew to Down Arts Centre is local musician Tony Wright who will provide a unique night of story and song with a killer sound track.\u0026nbsp\n\nAlso not to be missed is The \u0026lsquoLegend of Luke Kelly\u0026rsquo, a spectacular tribute to the greatest folk artist of the 20th century, a definite must-see for all fans.

community service dedicated to eighth century replica monument  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA REPLICA of St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross at Down Cathedral has been formally unveiled following a cross-community dedication service.\n\nThe replica eighth century cross \u0026mdash which stands an imposing 12-feet high and weighs five tonnes \u0026mdash is located just yards from where the patron saint is buried on the historic Hill of Down, with the Mournes in the distance providing a stunning back.\n\nBishops from the Church of Ireland and Catholic communities took part in last Friday afternoon\u0026rsquos service and they were joined by local clergy and monks from the Holy Cross Monastery in Rostrevor.\n\nFriday\u0026rsquos ceremony had been pencilled in for earlier in the summer but had to be postponed following the discovery of medieval human remains while contractors were preparing the ground for the installation of the cross, carved from Mourne granite excavated from Thomas\u0026rsquo Mountain high up in the mountain range.\n\nThe intricately designed structure was manufactured by the Kilkeel firm of McConnell Brothers and representatives from the firm were joined by Church of Ireland Bishop Harold Miller, Down and Connor Bishop Noel Treanor, the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, and members of the Cathedral Chapter.\n\nDean Hull, who led the short service of dedication, said the ceremony marked a very special day and was delighted a number of people heavily involved in the project were present, including Dr Mike King from the Down County Museum.\n\nDean Hull explained that Dr King played a key role initiating the replica cross project, financed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.\n\n\u0026ldquoMike worked hard along with others to bring about the cross which replicates one that was in place around 800AD. Inside Down Cathedral, there are some old stones and through research, Mike discovered they were in fact part of the original St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some old drawings of the cathedral you can see broken portions of the cross which marked nearby St Patrick\u0026rsquos grave. Obviously this old Celtic cross had fallen down and was broken with some pieces placed inside the church.\n\nDean Hull said Dr King, with the help of Philip Armstrong, redesigned the replica cross based on drawings and sketches and eventually, through the help of McConnell Brothers, the imposing replica cross was produced.\n\nThose in attendance at the dedication ceremony were told that the source of the granite used to make the replica cross was most probably the same as that from which the original was made, Dean Hull said the cross is at the heart of the Christian faith and that because Jesus died on the cross, people are reconciled to God and find forgiveness.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are reconciled to God but through the cross we can be reconciled to each other, with the cross reminding us of our common faith as Christians. It is lovely today that Christians from different traditions are able to stand around this cross today because the cross is a symbol of Christian unity and it reminds us that we have one faith, he continued.\n\nDean Hull said when people look at the cross and reflect back to Patrick and to the days of an undivided church, they are reminded that despite all has happened, \u0026ldquowe are still one in Christ with the cross a symbol of what people have in common\u0026nbsp \u0026mdash Christian unity.\n\nConcluding before the start of a short religious dedication service, Dean Hull thanked the Lecale and Down Historical Society which helped with the restoration project and the former Down Council and current Newry, Mourne and Down Council for their support.\n\nDean Hull\u0026rsquos words were reflected by Bishop Miller, who said a prayer as part of the dedication service along with Bishop Treanor.\n\nThe clerics then gathered at the base of the sculpture where they placed their palms over the imprint of a hand in the cross\u0026rsquos base and were joined by Bishop Grant Le Marque, former Anglican Bishop of the Horn of Africa, who was visiting the Down and Dromore Diocese.\n\n\u0026ldquoHere we have Christian hands together, said Bishop Miller, encouraging other people from all over the world to visit the cathedral to make the same gesture.\n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe cross is never just something at a distance it is the very heart of our faith in Christ, our relationship with Christ and our salvation in Christ.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new Translink bus service is extended to Clough  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA NEW bus service is operating in Clough.\n\nThe Downpatrick to Ballykinlar service is being extended to Clough from this month.

A super effort. The only other male junior, Oliver Robinson,\u0026nbsp did a double. The U-13 boys 100m in 15.15 and a strong run in the 1500m saw him finish in 5\u0026rsquo40.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nA promising start to his career as a Year 8 athlete. The sole senior of the night was Davy Foster in 1,500m running a fast 4\u0026rsquo50. Maybe Davy will stick to these faster shorter distances to try and keep up with his daughters.\n\nGirls galore\n\nTwo of the aforementioned Foster girls competed in the U-11 girls\u0026rsquo 1200m. In a competitive race Jodi hit the finish line in 4\u0026rsquo17 then not far behind was the always-smiling Kari in an impressive time of 4\u0026rsquo43. They both also tried the long jump.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn the U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 100m EDAC had three runners. Heat one saw Kara Trainor finish well in second place in 15.01. In heat three we saw Lauren Madine win in\u0026nbsp a new PB time of 14.16 and Anna Gardiner come home in 15.67 with Lauren taking the overall win and gold medal for the distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nKara\u0026rsquos time placed her sixth overall. It was pleasing to see them follow the lead of the younger girls by trying a field event as well, in this case the discus. Commendable enthusiasm!\n\nFab five females\n\nThe U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 1500m saw a large field of 14 athletes, five of which were EDAC runners and which also included the top class City of Lisburn athlete Katie McCleery, who is ranked in the top 10 in the UK for her age category over this distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nMcCleery made her intentions clear from the start as she immediately hit the front. Lauren decided to track her run and see how she went and was closely followed by Anna Gardiner, Lucy Foster, Kara Trainor and Emily Burns.\u0026nbsp\n\nAll five EDAC athletes looked superb over the three and three-quarter laps. On the last bend McCleery tried to hold on, but Lauren moved up another gear waiting and cruised past to take first place with 100m to run and crossed the line in a superb time of 4\u0026rsquo57 which is a PB by 18 seconds and puts Lauren 8th in the UK for her age for 2018. That was an outstanding performance.\n\nAnna Gardiner was the next EDAC athlete to finish in 5\u0026rsquo05 which is also a significant PB.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\n\nThe PBs were coming thick and fast as Lucy Foster came home in 5\u0026rsquo17 which was 12 seconds better than her previous best. The ever-improving duo of Kara Trainor and Emily Burns battled it out to the end and almost needed a photo finish to separate them \u0026mdash their times were\u0026nbsp 5.41.34 and 5.41.90. This race was really exciting to watch with brilliant efforts from all the girls. By filling first, third, fourth, seventh and eighth places, in the field of 14, there is surely cause for celebration at the depth of talent within the EDAC ranks.\n\nIcing on the cake\n\nLast girl to race was U-15 rising star Kirsti Foster in the 1500m. The girls were mixed with a strong U-15 boys\u0026rsquo field and Kirsti did not take the race lightly, despite carrying a slight niggle from hockey.\u0026nbsp\n\nShe dominated the girls\u0026rsquo field and beat some of the boys too in her race to finish a strong 5\u0026rsquo12 to provide a fitting finale to the night and to the track season.\n\nLaganside 10k\n\nPaula Radcliffe was obviously the star of the show, but EDAC had a few sparkling performances themselves.\u0026nbsp\n\nPaul Lloyd led the troops home and despite narrowly missing out on the elusive sub 40, he felt that he had given his all in the fast-paced race. His time of 40.08 is tantalisingly close and his consistency has to be commended.\u0026nbsp\n\nPhillip Vint, another man who rarely misses a weekend race, came next in 41.10 with Liam Keenan not far behind in 41.36. Gavin Hynds in 41.45 had plenty to celebrate as this was a PB and proves that marathon training doesn\u0026rsquot always slow you down and must be great morale booster for him.\u0026nbsp\n\nDeirdre v Paula?\n\nDeirdre Weatherall finished in 42.08 and was slightly disappointed with that. However, she was cheered up by the fact that Paula Radcliffe had decided to run in the pack and was seen in chat with ious folk en route.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis gave Deirdre the chance to have a sprint finish to the line with the women\u0026rsquos marathon world record holder.\n\nPaula also has European and World Championship medals too numerous to mention as well the accolade of four times Olympian. Many would defer to such greatness, but Deirdre is well known for her fresh-faced enthusiasm and took no time to decide that having a result sheet with her name one place ahead of Paula\u0026rsquos was an opportunity unlikely to be repeated.\n\nAfter reading on Wikipedia that Deirdre is described as the foremost tragic heroine in Irish legend and probably its best-known figure in modern times, she could probably argue that Paula should have been in awe of her rather than the other way round.\n\nThis is the spirit that is key to Deirdre\u0026rsquos rise in the ranks and long may it continue.\n\nLiam Smyth \u0026mdash veteran in terms of longevity in these events clocked up a respectable 44.42. Behind him another historic event was unfolding.\n\nGavin McConvey came in to the finish line in 53.51 declaring that the last time he saw a sub 54 minute 10K was in 2004. Not bad going Gavin, keep it up.\u0026nbsp\n\nRoisin Gaffney, another reliable EDAC runner, finished in 54.09 and for once found, despite her love of the sun, that the heat was oppressive and was glad to be done.\n\nDonal at the double\n\nDonal Smith headed to Kildare on Saturday to take part in an a 5k run in aid of the Injured Jockeys\u0026rsquo Fund - but having discovered that there was a 10K race nearby he decided in true horse lovers\u0026rsquo form to hedge his bets and do both. He did say afterwards that it was a lot for one day and he may need a few rest days, but knowing Donal, that won\u0026rsquot last for long.\n\nNo one from the club made their way to Derry on Sunday morning for the Waterside Half Marathon which this year was also the NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships.\n\nWhat\u0026rsquos ahead?\n\nThis will probably come too late for regular readers of the weekly papers, but Tuesday is the night for the annual trek to Castlewellan for the lung busting, for some, Mill Hill Mile Challenge.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis is a race that is, or should be, on everybody\u0026rsquos bucket list so if you\u0026rsquore going don t\u0026rsquo forget you must register online beforehand.

They were freed on bail later that evening.\n\nAiring last November, the Alex Gibney-directed documentary was a hard-hitting examination of claims of state collusion in the murders, which broke new ground by publicly naming alleged suspects.\n\nThe six men killed in Loughinisland were Adrian Rogan, Barney Green, Dan McCreanor, Eamon Byrne, Malcolm Jenkinson and Patsy O\u0026rsquoHare.\n\nClare Rogan, wife of Adrian Rogan, said the families would not be deterred in their search for truth and justice.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are shocked and appalled at the arrest of two journalists related to the No Stone Unturned documentary, which exposed the extent of state collusion between the state and loyalist paramilitaries in Loughinisland, she said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe British government have systematically denied and continue to cover up its role in the murder of six people in the Heights Bar.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThese arrests show the lengths of desperation that the British government and state forces are prepared to go to, in order to stifle the truth about what happened in Loughinisland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Police Ombudsman\u0026rsquos report into Loughinisland murders was one of the most damning expositions of state collusion in mass murder ever published.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoOur families, and many other families across the island, some of whom have been denied the basic right to an inquest, have campaigned for many years against state collusion and for truth and justice for our loved ones.\n\nSouth Down Sinn F\u0026eacutein MP Chris Hazzard has thanked those who came out to stand with the Loughinisland families on Friday night.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe arrests of two leading investigative journalists who helped lift the lid on collusion following the 1994 Loughinisland murders through \u0026lsquoNo Stone Unturned\u0026rsquo has re-opened many wounds for the families of those murdered, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThat truth would never have been possible without journalists like Barry and Trevor who acted always with integrity.

He started rowing back to shore, but one of the oars slipped overboard and into the water.\n\nAfter a few unsuccessful attempts to circle the oar, Mr Milligan decided to jump overboard to retrieve it. After getting the oar, Mr Milligan tried to swim back to the boat, but it was drifting away in the strong tide.\n\nA strong swimmer, Mr Milligan struck out for the shore and was about half a mile out when he was picked up by police in a rowing boat.\n\n\u0026ldquoI shouted to the children to keep calm and they did.

He is still the top bid. It is understood that two additional parties are interested in acquiring the 75,000 sq ft red brick building which once provided work for 400 people when it was owned by Hursts, part of the Ulster Weaving Group.\n\nNearly 150 years old, the five-storey mill was used for the wet spinning of flax and most of its flooring is tiled.\u0026nbsp This activity closed ten years ago. Today most of its windows are broken.\n\nOnly a handful of interested people turned up\u0026nbsp at Friday\u0026rsquos auction, for which the hotel ballroom had hundreds of chairs laid out. The auctioneer, Mr Sidney Mawhinney, adjourned activity when, as he said himself, the bidding hadn\u0026rsquot gone above the price of a very good modern bungalow.\n\nAfter consulting representatives of the vendors he came back to apologise for the delay and said that \u0026pound31,000 was a \u0026ldquoridiculous figure for Drumaness Mill and its ancillary buildings sited on approximately five acres.\n\nOwnership of the building has changed at least twice since it was sold by the Ulster Weaving\u0026nbsp Group of companies for rather less than \u0026pound20,000, considered to be very reasonable at the time.\n\nHopes of new employment being provided by a hatchery concern fizzled out about five years ago, only to be renewed in 1976 when Northern Dairies \u0026mdash now Dale Farm \u0026mdash acquired the property.\n\nBALLYCULTER \u0026mdash Fungus munching brothers Peter, Michael and Mark Johnston made a startling discovery during their summer holidays near Strangford. The boys stumbled on a giant puff-ball while holidaying at Cargagh Lane, Ballyculter, and since then they have discovered that it makes good eating.\n\nIndeed, they have already munched their way through half of the puff-ball, a perfect example of Calvatia Gigantea, which is very rare.\n\n\u0026ldquoAt first we had no idea what it was, said 14 year-old Michael. \u0026ldquoWe thought it had come from outer space.\n\nSixteen year-old brother Peter said: \u0026ldquoCuriosity forded us to taste it and we have now eaten more than half of it.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt is delicious when you try it in egg and breadcrumbs \u0026mdash it tastes like mushrooms. We were extremely lucky to find it because this has been a very bad year for fungi.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash The Eastern Health and Social Services Board has renewed its commitment to the building of a new general hospital in Downpatrick.\n\nSir Thomas Brown, Board chairman, told a local deputation this week that plans for the hospital had not been abandoned.\n\nSir Thomas gave the assurance to a five-man deputation from the Down District Health and Social Services Committee.\n\nAfterwards Mr O F Adams, committee chairman, said he accepted this as a \u0026ldquoclear statement of Board policy which will remain unaltered unless specific proposals to the contrary are put the Board.\n\nAnother committee member, Mr Cecil Maxwell, said he was \u0026ldquovery satisfied with the outcome of the meeting.\n\nNEWCASTLE \u0026mdash The special fireworks fiesta at Newcastle on Friday night drew big crowds to Donard Park. The display was organised by Down District Council as part of their Percy French festival and more than \u0026pound500 worth of fireworks were used.\n\nBilly Caughey was the master of ceremonies for the evening and introduced several bands who played selections prior to the display.\n\nCROSSGAR \u0026mdash Mr James Mejury, founder of the family motor business in Crossgar, died at his home this week. He was 80. A native of Ballyronan, Derry, he moved with his family from Belfast to Shrigley after the outbreak of the last war and began his business in Killyleagh Street, Crossgar.\n\nHis conscientiousness at work meant that 12-hour days were common place. The solution of customers\u0026rsquo problems were his delight.\n\nDRUMAROAD \u0026mdash Gene Fitzpatrick, voted Ulster\u0026rsquos top cabaret artist, is to compere a grand iety concert organised by St Patrick\u0026rsquos Scouts and Cubs in Drumaroad Hall next Tuesday night. A top class line-up includes Fergie, Houl Yer Whist, Dominic Hughes and a local supporting cast.\n\nDuring the past few months the boys and their leaders have been very busy. The cubs spent a very enjoyable five days at Clare, while 30 miles away the scouts were on a ten-day camp at Birr, Co Offaly.\n\nThe scouts won the Diocesan Shield and represented Dromore diocese a few weeks ago at the Melviin Trophy in Dublin where they gained considerable success.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash A harvest fair in Killinchy Presbyterian Church Hall on Saturday afternoon raised \u0026pound1,300 for church funds. There was a high standard of entries for the ious classes for bread, cakes, fruit and vegetables and sales were also good.\n\nThe crowds seemed to enjoy a iety of sideshows on the football pitch where darts shooting and beanbag games contributed to the fun.\u0026nbsp\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Local minister gets in tune for marathon on the organ  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA PLUMP cushion will be the Rev Mark Spratt\u0026rsquos best friend as he undertakes a 12-hour music marathon.\n\nThe minister of Kilmore Presbyterian Church, near Crossgar, is once again preparing to play an organ and piano non-stop to raise funds for the church.\n\nHe will be playing hundreds of psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, church music, classical pieces along with wedding favourites from 9am-9pm on Saturday, September 15.\u0026nbsp\n\nIt will the second time since 2014 that Mr Spratt will take to the keyboards to raise money for the Drumaghlis Road church where he is Director of Music.\n\nA renowned organist, Mr Spratt told the Recorder: \u0026ldquoI did a 12-hour marathon before in 2014 and that time we raised just over \u0026pound2,000 for the Women\u0026rsquos Association and other church activities.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis time it\u0026rsquos to raise money for repairs to the church\u0026rsquos roof and other property matters and I\u0026rsquoll be happy with whatever the community is able to give.\n\nMr Spratt has successfully completed two other music marathons for Bangor Presbyterian Church where he was part of the ministry team before he moved to Kilmore.

She said people expect the politicians to be at work and backed the clamour for them to engage in meaningful talks on the way forward and get back into government.\n\nThe Dundrum woman said the event, alongside those held in other towns, was designed to send a clear message that people have had enough and want the MLAs back in Stormont working for those who voted for them.\n\nJoan hopes the We Deserve Better campaign is something that will focus a lot of minds, explaining people are aware that some MLAs who want to get back to Stormont as part of a functioning Executive, but this has not been possible as result of the political leadership vacuum due to the DUP and Sinn Fein being unable to agree a way forward.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt feels as if we have been putting up with the impasse but there is momentum for change. Hopefully this movement will be able to grow and put some pressure on the politicians to get back, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoA lot of people have said that maybe we should do this again and last week I encouraged those in attendance to take photographs and send them to their MLAs to show the support there is for them to get back to work.\n\nJoan said the simple message from last week\u0026rsquos meeting to the politicians was: \u0026ldquoWe elected you, get back to work.\n\nShe added: \u0026ldquoThe politicians are in effect our employees, we elected them to do a job for us and at the minute they are not delivering.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it.

It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused.

It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres.
