She was made to start wearing a hijab at seven years old. Masih is pictured smiling with her brother in a new skirt made by her mother, the tailor for the village‘In 2014, before my campaign was launched, police announced 3.6 million women were sent to court for “inappropriate hijab”... 40,000 cars were impounded for inappropriate hijab,’ Masih states. Inappropriate hijab can be a headscarf that does not fully cover a woman’s hair or a hijab deemed to be the wrong colour.Every day, she receives dozens of images and videos from women inside Iran who are resisting the veil, which she shares on her Instagram and My Stealthy Freedom Facebook page. And weekly, on a day she has coined \u0027White Wednesdays\u0027, Iranian men and women wear the colour white to support her campaign.  ‘It started off with women sending photos of the back of their unveiled heads, then standing in hills and nature, then walking in public and then with their headscarf being waved on a stick,’ she says, explaining how women have grown bolder in their approach.To understand Masih’s bravery, it pays to look at her background. She was born in a tiny village of just 650 people, called Ghomikola, in Mazandaran, northern Iran, to deeply conservative and religious parents. In her new book, The Wind In My Hair, she describes how money was always tight and her freedom was always restricted.Masih wanted to climb trees and ride bikes like her older brother, Ali, but she was born in 1976, just two years before the Islamic Revolution overthrew 2,500 years of continuous Persian monarchy and stripped women of their freedom.One of the first laws imposed by the new Islamic regime, was the introduction of compulsory hijab in 1983, meaning women must always wear a veil over their hair when they’re in public.           Masih grew up in a religious family in a tiny village in northern Iran. She is pictured here with her grandmother, mother, sister, brother Ali. Masih is seen aged six in a headscarf (far right)Forty years later, Masih is helping women in Iran to ‘take their bodies back’ after they were ‘held hostage by the Islamic Republic of Iran’. She has recruited an army of millions of social media followers to help fight her battle. Masih was jailed at the age of 19. Not because she was unveiled but because she ‘became involved with student activists... we were all teenagers’.It was in a tiny cell, after hours of interrogation, that she found out she was pregnant. Her fiancé, Reza, was also in jail having been arrested first. He had noticed Masih’s periods had stopped and told the guards she was pregnant in the hope it would aid her release.‘We hadn’t had our official wedding party. Getting pregnant before getting married is not acceptable back then, 20 years ago, it was a scandal in my village,’ Masih says.          Masih found out she was pregnant at 19 while locked up in a jail cell. Later, her husband orced her and she lost custody to her son Pouyan. They are pictured here together trying on hats on one of his weekend visits to her house Sex education was non-existent in Iran. Even now, young people are forced to educate themselves about sex via social media. ‘I didn’t know that because my period had stopped it was a sign of getting pregnant…. An interrogator gave me a basket of apples and told me. I was shocked.’Masih was eventually sentenced to five years in prison and 74 lashes. Her sentence was suspended for three years, and Masih went on to marry Reza and give birth to her son Pouyan. But instead of going on to live the traditional, reserved family life the judge had hoped for, Masih’s life was thrown into turmoil when Reza decided to orce her. Iranian law meant it was his choice and he was also award custody of Pouyan, aged four.Masih’s father was ashamed of the orce and wanted her to move home to wait for another husband to come along. Instead, Masih began a career that has taken her from being a fledgling photographer to a parliamentary reporter, broadcaster and now internationally recognised women’s rights activist.Her anti-compulsory hijab campaign began in 2014 when - having received threats to her life and fearing another arrest due to her journalistic work - Masih, aged 33, moved to the UK to study at Oxford Brookes University.  Masih worked as a political reporter in Tehran but was banned from Parliament in 2005. She is pictured on her last day in the Majlis (left), facing MPs angry with her exposes of their corrupt practices          Masih can no longer visit her beloved parents, Zarrin Khanom and Aghajan, in Iran for fear of arrest upon her return. She says her conservative father, who supported the Islamic Revolution, \u0027has been brainwashed several times by the intelligence services\u0027  In her home, near Kew Gardens, she stepped out unveiled into a street lined with cherry blossom. Her partner, Kambiz, took a photo and Masih shared it on her Facebook page. The image, along with her message about how the same act would be illegal in Iran, went viral and began her My Stealthy Freedom Campaign.The cause has grown and grown. One video, shared this week on Masih’s Instagram page, has already had over five million views at the time of writing. It shows men and women in the popular tourist city of Isfahan standing up against the morality police who are trying to arrest a young woman because they believed her hijab is inappropriate.The caption reads: ‘The girl stood up to film them and police took her mobile away. But people supported her by chanting. “Give her mobile back, Leave her alone.” In the end, the police ran away.’Scenes like this are taking place across the country thanks to Masih’s campaign.Shaparak Shajarizadeh, was arrested in February after waving her headscarf from a stick while standing on a traffic island in Tehran (pictured). Masih was relieved when, one week later, Shaparak, who is a mother to a nine-year-old son, told her she would not stop protesting forced hijab          Shima Babaei was one of the first White Wednesday campaigners who answered Masih\u0027s call.  ‘Police used violence against her and her father. I felt so bad… but she sent me a video to share via another person saying “you can’t silence me”,’ Masih says‘The new generation of Iranian women will never ask the government for their rights they just take them. Women are told they can’t sing, but women are singing in Iran. They are told they can’t dance, but they are dancing. They are told they can’t show their, hair but they are doing it... this generation went beyond begging for their rights,’ Masih says.She makes clear she is not against people who want to wear the hijab, she is simply against the law that gives women no choice. ‘Iran should be for both sides, people that love hijab like my mum and sister and people that hate it like me,’ she laughs.                            Women are told they can’t sing, but women are singing in Iran. They are told they can’t dance, but they are dancing. They are told they can’t show their, hair but they are doing it.                         Some critics question whether Masih is putting women in danger from authorities by sharing their images on social media.It’s a question she once grappled with herself. ‘Because of my ‘White Wednesday’ campaign, the authorities announced they arrested 29 women... I was crying loudly in my house in New York and felt guilty,’ she says before explaining how messages from campaigners soon reassured her she was doing the right thing.‘When people tell me I’m putting women in danger it’s nonsense because the Islamic Republic has put women in danger for 40 years,’ she says. ‘They are tired of being humiliated and living in fear.’One brave campaigner, Shaparak Shajarizadeh, was arrested in February after waving her headscarf from a stick while standing on a traffic island in Tehran. Masih was relieved when, one week later, Shaparak, who is a mother to a nine-year-old son, told her she would not stop protesting forced hijab. ‘She told me “every Wednesday I feel useful”... she sent me a photo of herself unveiled in front of the prison after her release.’  ‘These are the Rosa Parks of Iran. They want to be heard. I am here outside of Iran and can help…. Shima was told “your crime is working for Masih” but she told the interrogator “Masih is working for me”.’           When this photo of Masih was taken, next to the stream in her village, she didn\u0027t know it would be the last time she would visit her home           Masih is pictured here with her second husband Kambiz Foroohar, who she now lives with in New York. An Iranian hard-line conservative website posted this picture of them online and labeled her a prostitute for appearing without a hijab Masih recounts a story of the time she went to the seaside fully clothed ‘not even in a burkini, proper clothes’. She went into the sea and was arrested simply for getting wet. ‘We were interrogated for a few hours about why we did it,’ she says incredulously. Police accused her of wanting to get men excited.‘Every day you come out of school and they treat you like a criminal,’ she adds.Fighting against the almighty Iranian regime, without weapons, may seem like an impossible struggle. But Masih, an eternal optimist, believes the battle is already won.‘The government has guns and bullets, state TV and the media. Our people only have their mobile phones but we won the battle. People are breaking through the censorship through social media. You can now see the true face of Iran. No one can ignore us anymore… they can’t say hijab is our culture anymore.’Masih believes there is a fear in the West about standing up against compulsory headscarf laws for fear of being deemed ‘Islamophobic’.‘What makes you Islamophobic is keeping silent about injustices like Sharia law, when you see women suffer and you keep silent that is causing Islamophobia.’           Masih has not seen her son Pouyan (pictured together) for more than a year due to Trump\u0027s travel ban, which has stopped Iranians from travelling to the U.S. At school in Iran, boys are forced to cut their hair to a minimum but when Pouyan moved to Oxford he let his curls grow like his mother          In 2016, the Iranian government allocated $1.7 billion for the protection of hijab - compared to $49 million for the protection of the environment. Masih now lives an unveiled life in New York while fighting for the rights of millions of women back home to choose how to dress Masih now lives with her second husband Kambiz in Brooklyn but she does not have a British, American or Iranian passport. Thanks to President Trump’s travel ban, this means she has not seen her 21-year-old son Pouyan - who is studying in England - for more than a year.‘The travel ban hurts ordinary people like me. It affects students, tourists, and human rights activists,’ she says.Masih is a woman who has endured a lot of pain in her life but it is only when talking about how much she misses Iran that she sounds tearful.‘If I had the chance to be in my own country and have the same voice as I have in America, I would definitely go back because I miss my country…‘But I was disrespected since the age of seven, expelled, jailed and never had the chance to be my true self there. Now I’ve seen my book published, I feel bad when I say Americas is not my home because I am respected here.’The Wind in My Hair: My Fight for Freedom in Modern Iran by Masih Alinejad is out now."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/11/4CF8135300000578-5811449-In_typical_style_he_cracked_a_joke_about_needing_a_new_watch_aft-a-32_1528280563865.jpg","title":"Michael McIntyre confirms continue Big World Tour","story":"    Michael McIntyre gave a cheeky grin after he told MailOnline today he was \u0027feeling better\u0027 after his terrifying knifepoint robbery           In typical style he cracked a joke about needing a new watch after the gang grabbed his Rolex admitting without one he could be late          McIntyre (pictured with his ten-year-old son) was mugged by two masked moped robbers on Monday as he prepared to drive away from school with his boy in North West LondonMcIntyre and young son Oscar, 10, were stopped in a London street by a gang of thugs who smashed his Range Rover with a hammer.The terrifying moment that sums up lawless London: Bystander...London fights back: As a crime wave grips the capital, new...Share this articleMoment masked thug tries to break into car using huge macheteRobbers flee on moped after robbery at Regent St jewellery shopHammer wielding gangs clash outside of a primary schoolAstonishing moment bystanders chase moped gang on Regent StreetMoment reckless lorry driver crashes into a low bridgeTourist mugged by gang outside Magaluf rocksPartners in crime: Golden retrievers open toddler\u0027s door for foodShocking footage of mass brawl between twelve peopleIrate cyclist uses CAR HORN to clear pedestrians out of bike lanesMember of Notting Hill gang seen rapping explicitly in rap videoPolice close road at night after a shooting in BrixtonMichael McIntyre, pictured today in London, will return to the stage tomorrow night in Dublin to continue his 104-date Big World Tour, which runs until summer 2019  The comedian, pictured left and right near his home, has tour dates in Ireland and Scotland this month before coming to London in the autumn. He was pictured wearing a different watch today (left) after the theft of his £15,000 Rolex          Pictures taken shortly after the attack show the driver\u0027s side window smashed and damage to Mr McIntyre\u0027s door          Pictures show stunned comic Michael McIntyre speaking with police moments after he was robbed by a moped gang  Mr McIntyre wears his valuable Rolex most of the time (circled) but was seen without it on his wrist in the aftermath of the terrifying moped attack Following the UK leg, he will continue performing next year, beginning in Norway in February and then heading to Australia and New Zealand.The tour concludes in Auckland, New Zealand, in June 2019. McIntyre was waiting outside a school in north London, when he was robbed at around 2pm on Monday.Police are investigating whether the moped gang followed him from his £5.7million Hampstead mansion with the aim of grabbing his Rolex or if he was the victim of a random attack because he was driving a luxury car in a wealthy London suburb. In a disgusting new tactic the gang struck as soon as the schoolboy was in the car knowing the comic would not risk them harming him.  London is fast becoming overrun by moped gangs with 22,000 crimes in the capital last year – 60 every day. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, said: ‘For some areas it’s fast becoming like the Wild West with criminals no longer afraid of getting caught\u0027.             Footage shows a flustered McIntyre, wearing a white shirt, take off his Rolex watch as one of the thieves leers over his shoulder    McIntyre can be seen holding up his hands as one of the men jumps off their moped and threatens him with a knife (circled)Footage, which was obtained by The Sun newspaper, shows a clearly shocked McIntyre standing on the pavement near the passenger seat with his son, as one of the masked attackers demands that he hands over his watch.The attacker then jumps onto the back of the moped, which had no number plates, and the pair speed off as a visibly shaken McIntyre comforts his son.A witness told The Sun: \u0027It was shocking to see. They pulled up to his car as it was stopped by the side of the road near to some traff­ic lights, which were green.\u0027They smashed the window which clearly startled Michael as it would anyone — then he jumped out the passenger’s side and they followed him round.The witness added: \u0027People who saw it were shocked too. No one went to help when it was happening, but it happened so fast, they were gone in seconds. They had hammers and I’m sure I saw one of them with a big knife.\u0027  In a chilling illustration of the moped gang crisis, a young woman was fighting for her life last night after her mobile was snatched by moped-riding thieves. And a motorcycle gang targeted yet another luxury store in London yesterday with pedestrians forced to try to tackle them, wrestling one suspect to the ground.Campaigners and politicians warned the attacks were matched by disturbing rises in stabbings, drug crime and gang violence.London now has a higher murder rate than New York, with more than 70 killings so far this year. Knife crime has also led to the deaths of a 17-year-old boy in Ipswich and of 15-year-olds in Sheffield and Wolverhampton.After an extraordinary day of violence, including the attack on Michael McIntyre, it emerged: Scotland Yard has logged 22,025 motorcycle muggings in 12 months – a rise of 50 per centOfficers revealed that city gangs had set up 650 ‘county line’ networks to sell drugs in towns and villages Police were hunting moped robbers who targeted comedian Michael McIntyre A rank-and-file police leader said officers were wary of chasing them for fear of possible disciplinary action A think-tank said shop theft cost £6.3billion last year – or £270 for every household.David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘A fall in police numbers combined with increasingly violent drug gangs has meant some parts of our cities resemble TV’s The Wire. Violent crime is rising and knife crime is rising as gangs fight over drug territories.’Experts believe a booming illicit drugs market – notably in crack cocaine – is fuelling much of the violence. They have also highlighted the middle-class appetite for regular cocaine.The Metropolitan Police figures showed that crimes committed using mopeds, scooters and motorcycles soared by 50 per cent in the year to May, to 22,025.               As the thugs fled, the 42-year-old rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his son (pictured), who is understood to have been in the car at the time of the attackMr McIntyre, 42, who is worth £38million, was waiting outside a school in northLondon, when he was robbed at around 2pm on Monday.Police are investigating whether the moped gang followed him from his £5.7million Hampstead mansion with the aim of grabbing his Rolex or if he was the victim of a random attack because he was driving a luxury car in a wealthy London suburb. The father-of-two was picking up Oscar, 10, who with his brother Lucas, 13, are the source of a lot of his material in his much-loved stand-up routines. Speaking after the incident, Mr McIntyre said: \u0027I can\u0027t really say what\u0027s happening, we\u0027re in the process of sorting this out. There\u0027s been an incident and we\u0027re dealing with it.\u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here, I can\u0027t say anything. This is not a wind up, it\u0027s ongoing and I can\u0027t share the details.\u0027 Journalist Jane Moore, who is married to the comic\u0027s agent Gary Farrow, believes Michael may have been targeted as soon as his son was in the car knowing the star would not risk them harming him.She told ITV\u0027s Loose Women: \u0027How terrifying - his 10-year-old son is in the front seat of the car, and this guy pulls up alongside and he\u0027s got a hammer. To smash a window like that it takes about 10 or 15 goes. Can you imagine how terrified?\u0027They probably targeted him because he had a child in his car, because as a parent you\u0027re not going to take anybody on, you\u0027re going to say, \u0027have whatever you want, don\u0027t hurt me or my child\u0027\u0027,She added: \u0027Somebody please do something about these gangs\u0027 while fellow panelist Anna Richardson said father and son should seek counsellling and revealed she had needed help after she was robbed in a hotel room in 2016. Mr McIntyre was in the Range Rover with his ten-year-old son  in the front passenger seat, one witness told the Mail. They originally claimed the star fell out of the driver\u0027s side and appeared to try to fight off the robbers during the 30-second attack.He then rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his shaken up son and give him a hug.A friend said today Michael, who is currently on the UK leg of his Big World Tour, is \u0027very shaken by the whole experience\u0027 but was uninjured. The moped gang dressed head-to-toe in black pulled up next to him and smashed their way into his car and demanded his Rolex before they sped away.Mr McIntyre\u0027s wife Kitty was reportedly seen close to the damaged car in \u0027floods of tears\u0027 as police spoke to her husband. Today she left the £5.7million family home  and told reporters her husband was \u0027fine\u0027.  Parents on the school run rushed to comfort the shocked star  and he looked shell-shocked and was heard saying: \u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here\u0027.It\u0027s not known if the comedian was targeted or his £120,000 Range Rover was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.             The robbers used hammers to destroy the driver\u0027s window and demanded his silver watch, worth around £15,000            A serious looking Kitty McIntyre, wife of Michael McIntyre, was photographed leaving the family home in North  London yesterday and said her husband is \u0027fine\u0027      Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan, left, had a £100,000 watch stolen after an armed moped rider stopped his Maserati in Croydon earlier this year. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James, pictured right, was targeted by moped thieves for her phone in MarchMoped riders also stole a £100,000 Franck Muller watch from former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan when he stopped in his Maserati in Croydon.The rider appeared to produce a gun and threatened the businessman through the window.Mr Jordan said his 80-year-old father was also in the car and was \u0027trying to have a pop at the gunman\u0027.A 32-year-old man was arrested and charged over the offence last month. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James was also targetted in March after two moped riders stole her phone near Kilburn station.The 30-year-old model former Celebrity Big Brother star revealed she chased down the thieves and got the phone back after tackling them.She added it was the second time such an incident had happened to her after having her handbag stolen in Barcelona.And Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe rushed to the aid of a tourist slashed in the face by a moped rider last July.The victim was targeted for a Louis Vuitton bag and Radcliffe, 27, rushed over to tend to him after the offenders sped away.  Raiders tried to steal Evening Standard editor George Osborne\u0027s phone as he left the BBC\u0027s Broadcasting House in May last year. Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe rushed to the aid of a tourist slashed in the face by a moped rider last July                        Kitty McIntyre left their £5.7million north London mansion at 8.20am on Tuesday morning and drove their eldest son Lucas, 13, to school. Oscar, ten, who is believed to have witnessed the attack was not with her.She returned to their six bedroom home and parked their silver-grey Range Rover sport courtesy car in the driveway.When asked if they were worried for their family\u0027s safety, the aromatherapist said: \u0027No, no. He\u0027s fine.\u0027The three-storey mansion, with a green door, had every blind and curtain drawn.It is not known if Michael, who is one of the most successful comedians of all time, is at home.His Range Rover, with the shattered window, was not outside his home. Moped crime has been described as being \u0027out of control\u0027 in London with 23,000 offences last year - up from 827 reported incidents in 2012. Gangs all over the capital have been trying to rip valuables such as phones and jewellery from drivers and pedestrians including millionaire Simon Jordan, whose £127,000 watch was taken at gunpoint as he sat in his Masarati in March.George Osborne almost had his phone ripped from his hand outside the BBC in May last year and Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe ran to the aid of a tourist who was attacked in Fulham. Michael McIntyre had been sitting outside the  school when two masked riders brandishing hammers pulled up next to him.They then smashed through his driver\u0027s window and stole his watch. It is not known if they took other items like his wallet and phone. One witness said: \u0027The guy at the front of the moped started to hit the driver\u0027s window about ten to 15 times and it eventually just cracked. He opens the door and gets Michael McIntyre out of the car. Michael fell but he was still trying to put up a fight.\u0027I just remember one of the bikers trying to get something. I don\u0027t know what the guy was trying to get – a watch, a wallet, maybe?\u0027And then within seconds they were gone down the hill. It was all so quick – the whole thing must have taken 30 seconds\u0027.He added he thought that Michael\u0027s son was in the car with him and was hugged by his dad and school friends afterwards.             Mr Mcintyre was photographed looking shell-shocked by his £120,000 Range Rover after yesterday afternoon\u0027s attack            The millionaire comedian was sitting in his Range Rover at around 2pm yesterday when the thugs started trying to smash his window with a hammerAnother witness said: \u0027I was driving along the road when I saw two men dressed head to toe in black. One man was on the bike and the other was either attacking or fighting Michael McIntyre. There was shouting too.\u0027The driver\u0027s window of his Range Rover was completely smashed. The second guy jumped on the back of the motorbike and they got away\u0027.       1.

On the northern end of that, there are just a few homes in the (Kapoho) beach lots area.\u0027 Resident Mark Johnson is hopeful that his home on a citrus farm is one of those still standing.

Lava has covered most of the Kapoho area except for a few houses sitting on high ground, though these have now been completely cut off from the outside world  Kilauea began erupting on May 3, destroying several homes in lower Puna and has been spewing lava and ash ever since. This destruction has occurred in the lower east rift area   Aerial image showing the extent of damage inland from the lava flows, which have been pouring into the ocean where they have cooled and created new land   An opening in the Kilauea volcano known as Fissure 8 is seen towards the bottom of this image, which shows how lava has flowed over the countryside and towards the ocean \u0027Over the course of essentially two days, that entire area was covered by lava,\u0027 Stovall said.Molten rock from the erupting Kilauea volcano already has destroyed at least 117 homes in the Lanipuna Gardens and Leilani Estates neighborhoods where lava surfaced more than a month ago. The total number of homes destroyed in the eruption stands at about 400.Scientists are still recording vigorous volcanic activity. While only one crack in the ground is spewing molten rock and the height of fountaining lava has decreased in recent days, \u0027it\u0027s still really impossible to tell,\u0027 when it will end, Stovall said.A magnitude 5.6 earthquake struck the summit of Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano, sending a plume of ash and rock about 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) into the sky Wednesday.The lava inundation is among the most destructive and costly in volcano property loss in U.S. history. While no one has been killed and only one lava-related injury has been reported, the number of destroyed homes dwarfs other recent American eruptions.It comes as a volcano erupted in Guatemala on Sunday and left 99 dead and nearly 200 missing.

Lava from the Kilauea volcano destroyed hundreds of homes in a mostly rural area on the Big Island of Hawaii overnightIn Hawaii, previous eruptions have destroyed small towns, but nothing on the scale of this outbreak. Lava flows destroyed homes and other buildings in the same area in 1955 and 1960, but the town of Kapoho was less densely populated at that time.Between 1983 and 2014, a Kilauea eruption razed homes in and around the town of Kalapana. Over the course of about eight months in 1990, 214 homes were destroyed in that area. One home was lost in a separate 2014 lava flow in the commercial hub of Pahoa.Even major explosive eruptions like that of Washington state\u0027s Mount St. Helens in 1980 didn\u0027t result in the same number of homes lost. That volcano and others in the region that have had recent eruptions are very remote with few people living nearby.At Kilauea\u0027s summit, increased earthquake activity has led to explosive eruptions, some of which have shot rock and ash high into the air.\u0027We expect larger explosions will continue at the summit,\u0027 Stovall said Wednesday.Jessica Ferracane, spokeswoman for Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, was on the summit Wednesday and said three \u0027sizable\u0027 earthquakes hit in the two hours she was there.\u0027It\u0027s a beautiful blue day, but it really seems eerie up there, lots and lots of ash covering areas near Jagger Museum and the earthquakes really make things seem very unsettled,\u0027 she said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/03/4CFF601A00000578-5815011-The_Italian_city_of_Turin_file_pic_is_the_latest_venue_to_host_t-m-2_1528337324983.jpg","title":"Secretive group global elite gather Turin latest Bilderberg Group meeting","story":"    Cardinal Pietro Parolin will meet with 130 carefully selected iniduals at the Bilderberg Group\u0027s latest secret meeting in Turin, Italy          The Italian city of Turin (file pic) is the latest venue to host the secretive meeting          NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (pictured in Brussels yesterday) is on the guest list          The 95-year-old former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (pictured) is also on the list of participants NATO chief says splits in the alliance triggered by Donald...You gave Kim Kardashian her wish, now pardon my husband!...EU\u0027s tit-for-tat tariffs against US, including on whiskey...Share this article    The guest list of influential figures includes governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney (pictured)      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/03/4CFE324500000578-5815047-image-a-61_1528336897421.jpg","title":"Housekeeper Kate Spade considered designer best friend","story":"Housekeeper Bella Cariaga (right) found Kate Spade (left) \u0027unconscious and unresponsive\u0027 after she committed suicide on Tuesday          Her son Mark Roldan (pictured with Cariaga) said his mom was traumatized after finding Spade on Tuesday morning, and their entire family was devastated by her suicide aged 55He rushed back to the apartment, cut the scarf around Spade\u0027s neck and attempted CPR. The designer was declared dead at the scene.

One claimed that he had to once wipe a \u0027substance\u0027 from the actor\u0027s face in a nightclub. It was also claimed that he spent the day \u0027smoking and drinking\u0027 on the set of City of Lies, formerly known as LAbyrinth, in which Depp plays a LAPD detective investigating the deaths of rappers Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur.             Possible explanation: Depp shaved his head and bleached his eyebrows to reprise his role as Grindewald in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. It wrapped filming in December and he has scarcely been seen since then . The film comes out in November           During his visit in Moscow, Depp also visited the Mayakovsky museum where, in one image, he looked happy and healthy as he posed with staff          A third image, taken in Moscow earlier in the week during a visit to a state museum, provoked more concern.

But Olive was a really mellow cat, nothing spooked her.\u0027One day we had a mouse in our house and Olive just sat there watching it. She didn\u0027t even move to catch it, which is when I first thought she might be OK around Luigi.\u0027When I first introduced them, Olive sized up Luigi but quickly realised how tough his exterior was and she began to use his scales to scratch her face.\u0027She is really drawn to them.

Thank God, this did not happen. Clearly we are dealing with something other than a military agent.\u0027\u0027We would like to be given access to our citizens, to Yulia, and we would like to have the opportunity to take part fully in the investigation.\u0027ON THE PROSPECT OF A THIRD WORLD WAR\u0027The understanding that a third world war could be the end of civilisation should restrain us from taking extreme steps on the international arena that are highly dangerous for modern civilisation.\u0027\u0027The threat of mutual destruction has always restrained participants of the international arena, prevented leading military powers from making hasty moves, and compelled participants to respect each other. U.S. withdrawal from treaties on anti-ballistic missiles is an attempt to put an end to strategic parity, but we will respond to this.\u0027\u0027We believe that the unilateral introduction of all kinds of sanctions does not resolve problems, it only worsens them.\u0027ON SPACE PROGRAM\u0027We need to take many steps forward, including in the quality of our satellites, in the quality of our equipment, and we must return and maintain our competence in launches, there\u0027s a lot of competition in this.\u0027\u0027Overall and in general, we have big and very ambitious plans for the development of our space program. I assure you were will continue down this path. It is no accident that we spent a lot on building a new space base in the east of our country.\u0027ON WEAPONS SYSTEMS\u0027There are weapons being developed, which I have already mentioned: two pieces of hardware with nuclear-powered engines, a global-range missile and an unmanned underwater vessel. In both cases we have completed the main development phase, in particular everything to do with testing the nuclear-powered engineâ¦\u0027\u0027But this is not all we plan to produce and put into service. It\u0027s too early to talk about it but we will do so soon.\u0027          Members of the public have submitted over 1.4 million questions, Russian news agencies reported, many of them visible on a special website set up for the eventON SYRIA\u0027Firstly, the use of our armed forces in the battlefield is a unique experience, a unique tool by which to improve our armed forces. No amount of military exercise could compare with the use of force in combat conditions.\u0027\u0027Yes, we know that the use of force in battlefield conditions is also associated with loss of lifeâ¦ But this was an important, a noble mission, aimed at protecting the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens.\u0027\u0027Let me remind you that thousands of militants left Russia and the countries of Central Asia â with whom we do not have hard borders â and gathered on Syrian soil. It was better to deal with them there, to get to work there, so to speak, and liquidate them there, than let them come back here, weapons in hand.\u0027\u0027Major military operations, particularly involving Russian armed forces, have ended. There isn\u0027t even a need for them anymore.\u0027\u0027Our soldiers are there (in Syria) in order to secure Russia\u0027s interests in this critically important part of the world, which is so near to us. And they will stay there, for as long as it is in Russia\u0027s interest for them to do so.\u0027\u0027As yet we do not plan to withdraw these forces. But I direct your attention to the fact that I did not call these bases by any other name - I called them bases. We are not building long-term military structures there and if we need to, we could withdraw our military personnel very quickly, without incurring any financial losses.\u0027ON RESTRICTIONS TO RUSSIAN BUSINESS ABROAD\u0027With regards to big business, I spoke about this a few years ago at one of the public meetings with our business leaders. It sounded a bit rude: I warned them that this situation, which we see today, could develop. I warned them about this and recommended at the time that our business keeps its capital in Russia, in the motherland. To keep capital in the place where it was earned and to use it to develop the Russian economy.\u0027\u0027Who is going to help them abroad? They are just persecuted there. Conditions are created making their work impossible. This is a big mistake by those, who are doing this in the West. All these restrictions, all this persecution of our businesses, their difficulties with dollar transactions, it damages the trust businesses from our country and others have in the economic policies of leading global economies. When the United States limits dollar transactions, this damages trust in the dollar.\u0027\u0027In essence, they are sawing the branch on which they are sitting. This is counterproductive and damaging for those involved and for the global economy.\u0027\u0027Some say we need to help Abramovich and other Russian businessmen who have ended up in a difficult situation. I wouldn\u0027t want to speak right now about those people who have broken various laws. I am speaking about people who acquired their capital through legal means. The former and the latter are better off being in Russia.\u0027 ON SANCTIONS\u0027This is a method by which to restrain Russia, the notorious sanctions, because endless accusations lay the groundwork for introducing restraining measures.\u0027\u0027It is because Russia is seen as a threat, because Russia is seen as becoming a competitor. I believe this approach is mistaken. Instead of restraining whoever it would be better to establish constructive cooperation, and then the overall effect on the global economy would be positive.\u0027\u0027It is clear to us that we have to defend our interests, and to do so consistently, not boorishly or rudely, in both the sphere of the economy and of defence. We have done so and we will continue to do so, but we always look for compromises, we aspire towards those compromises. The pressure will end when our partners will be persuaded that the methods they are using are ineffective, counterproductive and harmful to all.\u0027 ON STEEL TARIFFS\u0027The introduction, for example, of restrictive tariffs on steel, on aluminium, not only for Europe but also for Canada and Mexico, in essence these are also sanctionsâ¦ They are related to the pragmatic national interests of the United States.\u0027\u0027We need to work out united and consistently understandable and concrete rules on how to behave in the realm of security and in the realm of economic interaction.\u0027\u0027When in 2007 I spoke in Munich, a speech that is frequently quoted nowadays, I spoke about the fact that the United States is widening the jurisdiction of its laws beyond its national borders, and that this is unacceptable. And that\u0027s exactly what\u0027s happening now, also to our European and other partners. Why is this happening? No one wanted to listen and no one did anything to stop this from developing.\u0027          Critics say the event, which is being held days before Russia hosts the soccer World Cup, is a stage-managed piece of theatre designed to let Russians let off steam and fleetingly feel like they can influence a bureaucratic top-down systemON BALTIC STATES\u0027When it comes to the position of our compatriots in the countries of the Baltic, we are constantly talking about this, bringing it to the attention of the governments of the Baltic states, including Latviaâ¦ The measures that we take to protect the interests of our compatriots must be such that they do not actually worsen their situation.\u0027ON OTHER STATES\u0027 APPROACH TO U.S. SANCTIONS\u0027This is an important part of the negotiation process with the leaders of France, Germany, also with our Austrian friends, where I was visiting just now, and with the representatives of many other European countries, let alone Asia. They don\u0027t just say this privately now, they are talking about this publicly.\u0027\u0027It appears, our partners thought that this would never affect them, this counterproductive politics of restrictions and sanctions. But now we are seeing that this is happening.\u0027ON THE SOCCER WORLD CUP\u0027With regards to the infrastructure, these 11 stadiums. Of course, we spent a lot of money on this and it is imperative that all of this infrastructure, I completely agree, it must work and above all work towards the development of sport on a large scale, including children\u0027s sport.\u0027\u0027I would like right now to address my colleagues in the regions, to ask them to not allow, under any circumstances, for flea markets and the like to appear at these stadiums, as appeared in other sport-related buildings in Moscow during the middle of the 1990s.\u0027\u0027I think our Russian Football Union must play an active part in thisâ¦ and develop a new generation of sportsmen and soccer players.\u0027\u0027Even though our national team has not demonstrated strong results recently, but the number of fans of this beautiful sport here is massive, it\u0027s in the millions. We will rely on the fact that our soccer team will score a big win, so to speak, and will show its best qualities.\u0027ON THE ECONOMY\u0027Overall, we are moving in the right direction. What is the basis for saying this? We have started on the trajectory towards robust economic growth in Russia. Yes, this growth is humble, small, but it is also not a fall. Growth was at 1.5 percent last year.\u0027\u0027Not everyone feels this personally but overall, this is an objective statistic. That\u0027s how it is, it is the truth. Export in technical equipment is growing, which shows that some structural changes are going on in the economy. Export of agricultural produce, at 20 billion last year, was higher than defence exports, which were at 15 billion.\u0027          Putin and his aides say the phone-in is an indispensable tool to gauge public sentiment and learn what people\u0027s real problems areON TAXES\u0027Based on our preliminary calculations, we may in the next six years spend 17 billion roubles, but to achieve the goals that we have discussed, we will need an additional 8 trillion roubles. And it is clear where we are going to find them.\u0027\u0027Firstly, it is through the growth of the economy itself, that\u0027s the main source of additional resources. It is also the more effective use of existing resources, adjustment in some senses of our macro-economic plans and of course adjustments to our tax policy.\u0027\u0027Stability of tax policy must be absolutely guaranteed for the next six years.\u0027\u0027Many suggest changing the personal income tax. We thought about this for a long time. At first glance, progressive personal income tax seems and looks to be fairerâ¦ But reality is more complicated than theories and formulas.\u0027\u0027We had such a tax â a tax on revenue. This is a serious strain on the economy overall and in the end on citizens, because it inevitably leads to a rise in inflation. All this convinced us that introducing this was also not expedient.\u0027ON THE NEW GOVERNMENT\u0027The thing is, the development plan which we have been discussing in recent years, it was being prepared by the previous government during at least the past one and a half years. I know full well that if we were to replace the entire government 100 percent, and bring in totally new peopleâ¦ we would have lost at least two years, and we do not have those two years.\u0027\u0027But it was also necessary to keep those, who made the decisions for our country\u0027s progress. And to personalize responsibility for what has been done so far and for what is coming up soon.\u0027\u0027I think that we have an optimal make up of government for today.\u0027ON GASOLINE PRICES\u0027What is going on right now, it is unacceptable, it is wrong. However, it must be admitted that it is the result of inaccurate regulation, that was brought in recently in the sphere of energy, in energy resources.\u0027\u0027By the autumn of this year, additional measures should be introduced which will stabilize the situation on the market. I am basing this on the fact that the government will be monitoring this carefully.\u0027      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/12/4CFCA0FD00000578-5816571-image-a-37_1528371476927.jpg","title":"G7 need know G7 Summit G7 countries","story":"    A Canadian mounted police officer walks past the Charlevoix G7 logo ahead of G7 SummitWhat is the G7?The Group of Seven, more commonly known as the G7, is made up of seven of the world’s most richest economies.The G7 countries include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, making up 62 percent of the world’s net wealth ($280 trillion or £208 tn) and 32 percent of the global purchasing parity GDP.The concept of the G7 was formed before the 1973 oil crisis and two years later, France brought together representatives from the seven countries and these informal meetings started to be held. The European Union has also been a non-enumerated member of the G7 since 1977, but they do not hold a chair or host any summits.          Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron talk during a bilateral meeting at the G7 Summit in 2017What is the G7 Summit?Every year, leaders of all G7 countries meet to discuss important issues that are affecting the world and policy agreements that are made at the G7 Summit ultimately have a trickle-down effect on countries around the world.The location of the G7 Summit changes between the nations that are represented by their member and the leader of the hosting nation hold the G7 Presidency for that ear. It is their responsibility to host and organise the annual event and set the agenda.Where is the G7 being held in 2018?In 2018, the G7 Summit will be held on June 8-9 2018 in Charlevoix, Quebec, Canada with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the G7 President this year.          Leaders of the G7 countries seen here attending a working meeting at the G7 summit in 2015What will be discussed at the G7 2018 Summit?For this year’s G7 Summit, Justin Trudeau has set up ministerial meetings on five topics:1. Advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment2. Investing in growth that works for everyone3. Preparing for jobs of the future4. Working together on climate change, oceans, and clean energy5. Building a more peaceful and secure worldThe first of these goals is even more so poignant after Trudeau referred to himself as a feminist leader and the subject of gender parity is expected to be a dominant theme, across all five discussion topics.Alongside this, with perceptions of the US have fallen after 15 women came forward accusing Trump of sexual harassment, in addition to what was heard on the Access Hollywood tape, Trudeau has set up a Gender Equality Advisory Council.          George W. Bush, John Major and James Baker pictured at the G7 summit, when held in LondonWhat is the Gender Equality Advisory Council?Dayle Haddon, one of the 19 who make up what is being dubbed ‘The Council’, mentioned that private sector accountability and more investment in technology will also be main talking points on both days, according to Notable Life. ‘If you’re not being represented, complete decisions can’t be made.‘In matters such as creating future jobs, we need help designing what that landscape looks like when gender parity is incorporated. If the majority of people working on future-shaping technologies like AI are male, what they are creating will have a male worldview, which only enforces the problem.‘We need growth that works for everyone, and to do that we need to increase girls’ education levels in the technology and AI industries so they have access to these new jobs of the future,’ she said.The aim of the Gender Equality Advisory Council is to call on private sector companies to step up and eradicate this problem and The Council will look to organisations to publicly commit to achieving a gender-neutral board, with equal pay and equal leadership by 2020.‘The leadership qualities that Prime Minister Trudeau is manifesting are extremely impressive. It’s like Canada is standing up,’ Haddon said.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse cast and trailer revealedAlice Marie Johnson revealed after Trump granted her clemency following Kim Kardashian West push Bradley Cooper\u0026#8217s A Star is Born trailer, cast and release dateG7: All you need to know about the G7 Summit and the G7 countries MTV Movie \u0026 TV Awards 2018 date, nominees and performers revealedWas Kate Spade related to actor David Spade?Guns N Roses to take Not In This Lifetime Tour to South AfricaWho was Dr. Virginia Apgar?

She was made to start wearing a hijab at seven years old. Masih is pictured smiling with her brother in a new skirt made by her mother, the tailor for the village‘In 2014, before my campaign was launched, police announced 3.6 million women were sent to court for “inappropriate hijab”... 40,000 cars were impounded for inappropriate hijab,’ Masih states. Inappropriate hijab can be a headscarf that does not fully cover a woman’s hair or a hijab deemed to be the wrong colour.Every day, she receives dozens of images and videos from women inside Iran who are resisting the veil, which she shares on her Instagram and My Stealthy Freedom Facebook page. And weekly, on a day she has coined \u0027White Wednesdays\u0027, Iranian men and women wear the colour white to support her campaign.  ‘It started off with women sending photos of the back of their unveiled heads, then standing in hills and nature, then walking in public and then with their headscarf being waved on a stick,’ she says, explaining how women have grown bolder in their approach.To understand Masih’s bravery, it pays to look at her background. She was born in a tiny village of just 650 people, called Ghomikola, in Mazandaran, northern Iran, to deeply conservative and religious parents. In her new book, The Wind In My Hair, she describes how money was always tight and her freedom was always restricted.Masih wanted to climb trees and ride bikes like her older brother, Ali, but she was born in 1976, just two years before the Islamic Revolution overthrew 2,500 years of continuous Persian monarchy and stripped women of their freedom.One of the first laws imposed by the new Islamic regime, was the introduction of compulsory hijab in 1983, meaning women must always wear a veil over their hair when they’re in public.           Masih grew up in a religious family in a tiny village in northern Iran. She is pictured here with her grandmother, mother, sister, brother Ali. Masih is seen aged six in a headscarf (far right)Forty years later, Masih is helping women in Iran to ‘take their bodies back’ after they were ‘held hostage by the Islamic Republic of Iran’. She has recruited an army of millions of social media followers to help fight her battle. Masih was jailed at the age of 19. Not because she was unveiled but because she ‘became involved with student activists... we were all teenagers’.It was in a tiny cell, after hours of interrogation, that she found out she was pregnant. Her fiancé, Reza, was also in jail having been arrested first. He had noticed Masih’s periods had stopped and told the guards she was pregnant in the hope it would aid her release.‘We hadn’t had our official wedding party. Getting pregnant before getting married is not acceptable back then, 20 years ago, it was a scandal in my village,’ Masih says.          Masih found out she was pregnant at 19 while locked up in a jail cell. Later, her husband orced her and she lost custody to her son Pouyan. They are pictured here together trying on hats on one of his weekend visits to her house Sex education was non-existent in Iran. Even now, young people are forced to educate themselves about sex via social media. ‘I didn’t know that because my period had stopped it was a sign of getting pregnant…. An interrogator gave me a basket of apples and told me. I was shocked.’Masih was eventually sentenced to five years in prison and 74 lashes. Her sentence was suspended for three years, and Masih went on to marry Reza and give birth to her son Pouyan. But instead of going on to live the traditional, reserved family life the judge had hoped for, Masih’s life was thrown into turmoil when Reza decided to orce her. Iranian law meant it was his choice and he was also award custody of Pouyan, aged four.Masih’s father was ashamed of the orce and wanted her to move home to wait for another husband to come along. Instead, Masih began a career that has taken her from being a fledgling photographer to a parliamentary reporter, broadcaster and now internationally recognised women’s rights activist.Her anti-compulsory hijab campaign began in 2014 when - having received threats to her life and fearing another arrest due to her journalistic work - Masih, aged 33, moved to the UK to study at Oxford Brookes University.  Masih worked as a political reporter in Tehran but was banned from Parliament in 2005. She is pictured on her last day in the Majlis (left), facing MPs angry with her exposes of their corrupt practices          Masih can no longer visit her beloved parents, Zarrin Khanom and Aghajan, in Iran for fear of arrest upon her return. She says her conservative father, who supported the Islamic Revolution, \u0027has been brainwashed several times by the intelligence services\u0027  In her home, near Kew Gardens, she stepped out unveiled into a street lined with cherry blossom. Her partner, Kambiz, took a photo and Masih shared it on her Facebook page. The image, along with her message about how the same act would be illegal in Iran, went viral and began her My Stealthy Freedom Campaign.The cause has grown and grown. One video, shared this week on Masih’s Instagram page, has already had over five million views at the time of writing. It shows men and women in the popular tourist city of Isfahan standing up against the morality police who are trying to arrest a young woman because they believed her hijab is inappropriate.The caption reads: ‘The girl stood up to film them and police took her mobile away. But people supported her by chanting. “Give her mobile back, Leave her alone.” In the end, the police ran away.’Scenes like this are taking place across the country thanks to Masih’s campaign.Shaparak Shajarizadeh, was arrested in February after waving her headscarf from a stick while standing on a traffic island in Tehran (pictured). Masih was relieved when, one week later, Shaparak, who is a mother to a nine-year-old son, told her she would not stop protesting forced hijab          Shima Babaei was one of the first White Wednesday campaigners who answered Masih\u0027s call.  ‘Police used violence against her and her father. I felt so bad… but she sent me a video to share via another person saying “you can’t silence me”,’ Masih says‘The new generation of Iranian women will never ask the government for their rights they just take them. Women are told they can’t sing, but women are singing in Iran. They are told they can’t dance, but they are dancing. They are told they can’t show their, hair but they are doing it... this generation went beyond begging for their rights,’ Masih says.She makes clear she is not against people who want to wear the hijab, she is simply against the law that gives women no choice. ‘Iran should be for both sides, people that love hijab like my mum and sister and people that hate it like me,’ she laughs.                            Women are told they can’t sing, but women are singing in Iran. They are told they can’t dance, but they are dancing. They are told they can’t show their, hair but they are doing it.                         Some critics question whether Masih is putting women in danger from authorities by sharing their images on social media.It’s a question she once grappled with herself. ‘Because of my ‘White Wednesday’ campaign, the authorities announced they arrested 29 women... I was crying loudly in my house in New York and felt guilty,’ she says before explaining how messages from campaigners soon reassured her she was doing the right thing.‘When people tell me I’m putting women in danger it’s nonsense because the Islamic Republic has put women in danger for 40 years,’ she says. ‘They are tired of being humiliated and living in fear.’One brave campaigner, Shaparak Shajarizadeh, was arrested in February after waving her headscarf from a stick while standing on a traffic island in Tehran. Masih was relieved when, one week later, Shaparak, who is a mother to a nine-year-old son, told her she would not stop protesting forced hijab. ‘She told me “every Wednesday I feel useful”... she sent me a photo of herself unveiled in front of the prison after her release.’  ‘These are the Rosa Parks of Iran. They want to be heard. I am here outside of Iran and can help…. Shima was told “your crime is working for Masih” but she told the interrogator “Masih is working for me”.’           When this photo of Masih was taken, next to the stream in her village, she didn\u0027t know it would be the last time she would visit her home           Masih is pictured here with her second husband Kambiz Foroohar, who she now lives with in New York. An Iranian hard-line conservative website posted this picture of them online and labeled her a prostitute for appearing without a hijab Masih recounts a story of the time she went to the seaside fully clothed ‘not even in a burkini, proper clothes’. She went into the sea and was arrested simply for getting wet. ‘We were interrogated for a few hours about why we did it,’ she says incredulously. Police accused her of wanting to get men excited.‘Every day you come out of school and they treat you like a criminal,’ she adds.Fighting against the almighty Iranian regime, without weapons, may seem like an impossible struggle. But Masih, an eternal optimist, believes the battle is already won.‘The government has guns and bullets, state TV and the media. Our people only have their mobile phones but we won the battle. People are breaking through the censorship through social media. You can now see the true face of Iran. No one can ignore us anymore… they can’t say hijab is our culture anymore.’Masih believes there is a fear in the West about standing up against compulsory headscarf laws for fear of being deemed ‘Islamophobic’.‘What makes you Islamophobic is keeping silent about injustices like Sharia law, when you see women suffer and you keep silent that is causing Islamophobia.’           Masih has not seen her son Pouyan (pictured together) for more than a year due to Trump\u0027s travel ban, which has stopped Iranians from travelling to the U.S. At school in Iran, boys are forced to cut their hair to a minimum but when Pouyan moved to Oxford he let his curls grow like his mother          In 2016, the Iranian government allocated $1.7 billion for the protection of hijab - compared to $49 million for the protection of the environment. Masih now lives an unveiled life in New York while fighting for the rights of millions of women back home to choose how to dress Masih now lives with her second husband Kambiz in Brooklyn but she does not have a British, American or Iranian passport. Thanks to President Trump’s travel ban, this means she has not seen her 21-year-old son Pouyan - who is studying in England - for more than a year.‘The travel ban hurts ordinary people like me. It affects students, tourists, and human rights activists,’ she says.Masih is a woman who has endured a lot of pain in her life but it is only when talking about how much she misses Iran that she sounds tearful.‘If I had the chance to be in my own country and have the same voice as I have in America, I would definitely go back because I miss my country…‘But I was disrespected since the age of seven, expelled, jailed and never had the chance to be my true self there. Now I’ve seen my book published, I feel bad when I say Americas is not my home because I am respected here.’The Wind in My Hair: My Fight for Freedom in Modern Iran by Masih Alinejad is out now."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/18/4CFBB57D00000578-5813513-image-a-3_1528306506640.jpg","title":"Irate cyclist determined rid Londons bike lanes pedestrians uses CAR HORN clear them","story":"    The cyclist is seen enthusiastically holding up an air horn which he then attaches to his handlebar using thick black tape          Testing out his new instrument, the cyclist peddles quickly down a bike lane where he can see a crowd of people blocking his path in the distance - which he quickly clears with the hornTo ensure that his route his clear he holds down the air horn causing them to leap out of his way, clearly startled by the blaring noise. The man continues to use his new device as he rides through the city with similar results.‘He got his comeuppance’: Moment lorry CRASHES into a low...\u0027I looked up and there was just billows and billows of...Share this articleIn one shot, a man wearing a black hooded jacket and trousers is seen blocking a cycling path which prompts the cyclist to use his horn as before.However this time it causes an angry reaction from the shaken pedestrian who appears to turn around to hit the cyclistAfter some angry words, the cyclist protests that \u0027it\u0027s a cycle lane\u0027 before blaring his horn one more time and riding into the distance.

Lava has covered most of the Kapoho area except for a few houses sitting on high ground, though these have now been completely cut off from the outside world  Kilauea began erupting on May 3, destroying several homes in lower Puna and has been spewing lava and ash ever since. This destruction has occurred in the lower east rift area   Aerial image showing the extent of damage inland from the lava flows, which have been pouring into the ocean where they have cooled and created new land   An opening in the Kilauea volcano known as Fissure 8 is seen towards the bottom of this image, which shows how lava has flowed over the countryside and towards the ocean \u0027Over the course of essentially two days, that entire area was covered by lava,\u0027 Stovall said.Molten rock from the erupting Kilauea volcano already has destroyed at least 117 homes in the Lanipuna Gardens and Leilani Estates neighborhoods where lava surfaced more than a month ago. The total number of homes destroyed in the eruption stands at about 400.Scientists are still recording vigorous volcanic activity. While only one crack in the ground is spewing molten rock and the height of fountaining lava has decreased in recent days, \u0027it\u0027s still really impossible to tell,\u0027 when it will end, Stovall said.A magnitude 5.6 earthquake struck the summit of Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano, sending a plume of ash and rock about 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) into the sky Wednesday.The lava inundation is among the most destructive and costly in volcano property loss in U.S. history. While no one has been killed and only one lava-related injury has been reported, the number of destroyed homes dwarfs other recent American eruptions.It comes as a volcano erupted in Guatemala on Sunday and left 99 dead and nearly 200 missing.  A fissure continues to blast fresh lava several hundred feet in the air and flow towards Kapoho as the Kilauea Volcano lower east rift zone eruption continues on Wednesday, June 6  The caldera on the Kilauea Volcano emits a small amount of steam with the lower east rift zone eruption lava access point in Kapoho putting out much more in the distance  This satellite image shows Kilauea summit crater in Hawaii. Lava from the Kilauea volcano destroyed hundreds of homes in a mostly rural area on the Big Island of Hawaii overnightIn Hawaii, previous eruptions have destroyed small towns, but nothing on the scale of this outbreak. Lava flows destroyed homes and other buildings in the same area in 1955 and 1960, but the town of Kapoho was less densely populated at that time.Between 1983 and 2014, a Kilauea eruption razed homes in and around the town of Kalapana. Over the course of about eight months in 1990, 214 homes were destroyed in that area. One home was lost in a separate 2014 lava flow in the commercial hub of Pahoa.Even major explosive eruptions like that of Washington state\u0027s Mount St. Helens in 1980 didn\u0027t result in the same number of homes lost. That volcano and others in the region that have had recent eruptions are very remote with few people living nearby.At Kilauea\u0027s summit, increased earthquake activity has led to explosive eruptions, some of which have shot rock and ash high into the air.\u0027We expect larger explosions will continue at the summit,\u0027 Stovall said Wednesday.Jessica Ferracane, spokeswoman for Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, was on the summit Wednesday and said three \u0027sizable\u0027 earthquakes hit in the two hours she was there.\u0027It\u0027s a beautiful blue day, but it really seems eerie up there, lots and lots of ash covering areas near Jagger Museum and the earthquakes really make things seem very unsettled,\u0027 she said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/03/4CFF601A00000578-5815011-The_Italian_city_of_Turin_file_pic_is_the_latest_venue_to_host_t-m-2_1528337324983.jpg","title":"Secretive group global elite gather Turin latest Bilderberg Group meeting","story":"    Cardinal Pietro Parolin will meet with 130 carefully selected iniduals at the Bilderberg Group\u0027s latest secret meeting in Turin, Italy          The Italian city of Turin (file pic) is the latest venue to host the secretive meeting          NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (pictured in Brussels yesterday) is on the guest list          The 95-year-old former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (pictured) is also on the list of participants NATO chief says splits in the alliance triggered by Donald...You gave Kim Kardashian her wish, now pardon my husband!...EU\u0027s tit-for-tat tariffs against US, including on whiskey...Share this article    The guest list of influential figures includes governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney (pictured)      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/08/4CFCBCD300000578-5815573-Pool_goers_relax_by_the_water_of_the_Marbella_Club_in_Marbella_S-a-14_1528355566272.jpg","title":"Famous society artist photographs attractive people things","story":"    A guest is seen taking a break from the heat while at the Marbella Club in Marbella, Spain in this 1976 photo by photographer Slim Aarons          Pool-goers relax by the water of the Marbella Club in Marbella, Spain in August 1980          Marietine Birnie is seen snorkeling at the Blue Lagoon, Kemmuna (Comina) in Malta in July 1959This followed his time employed as a World War II combat photographer.  Aarons, before long, began globetrotting.

Thank God, this did not happen. Clearly we are dealing with something other than a military agent.\u0027\u0027We would like to be given access to our citizens, to Yulia, and we would like to have the opportunity to take part fully in the investigation.\u0027ON THE PROSPECT OF A THIRD WORLD WAR\u0027The understanding that a third world war could be the end of civilisation should restrain us from taking extreme steps on the international arena that are highly dangerous for modern civilisation.\u0027\u0027The threat of mutual destruction has always restrained participants of the international arena, prevented leading military powers from making hasty moves, and compelled participants to respect each other. U.S. withdrawal from treaties on anti-ballistic missiles is an attempt to put an end to strategic parity, but we will respond to this.\u0027\u0027We believe that the unilateral introduction of all kinds of sanctions does not resolve problems, it only worsens them.\u0027ON SPACE PROGRAM\u0027We need to take many steps forward, including in the quality of our satellites, in the quality of our equipment, and we must return and maintain our competence in launches, there\u0027s a lot of competition in this.\u0027\u0027Overall and in general, we have big and very ambitious plans for the development of our space program. I assure you were will continue down this path. It is no accident that we spent a lot on building a new space base in the east of our country.\u0027ON WEAPONS SYSTEMS\u0027There are weapons being developed, which I have already mentioned: two pieces of hardware with nuclear-powered engines, a global-range missile and an unmanned underwater vessel. In both cases we have completed the main development phase, in particular everything to do with testing the nuclear-powered engineâ¦\u0027\u0027But this is not all we plan to produce and put into service. It\u0027s too early to talk about it but we will do so soon.\u0027          Members of the public have submitted over 1.4 million questions, Russian news agencies reported, many of them visible on a special website set up for the eventON SYRIA\u0027Firstly, the use of our armed forces in the battlefield is a unique experience, a unique tool by which to improve our armed forces. No amount of military exercise could compare with the use of force in combat conditions.\u0027\u0027Yes, we know that the use of force in battlefield conditions is also associated with loss of lifeâ¦ But this was an important, a noble mission, aimed at protecting the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens.\u0027\u0027Let me remind you that thousands of militants left Russia and the countries of Central Asia â with whom we do not have hard borders â and gathered on Syrian soil. It was better to deal with them there, to get to work there, so to speak, and liquidate them there, than let them come back here, weapons in hand.\u0027\u0027Major military operations, particularly involving Russian armed forces, have ended. There isn\u0027t even a need for them anymore.\u0027\u0027Our soldiers are there (in Syria) in order to secure Russia\u0027s interests in this critically important part of the world, which is so near to us. And they will stay there, for as long as it is in Russia\u0027s interest for them to do so.\u0027\u0027As yet we do not plan to withdraw these forces. But I direct your attention to the fact that I did not call these bases by any other name - I called them bases. We are not building long-term military structures there and if we need to, we could withdraw our military personnel very quickly, without incurring any financial losses.\u0027ON RESTRICTIONS TO RUSSIAN BUSINESS ABROAD\u0027With regards to big business, I spoke about this a few years ago at one of the public meetings with our business leaders. It sounded a bit rude: I warned them that this situation, which we see today, could develop. I warned them about this and recommended at the time that our business keeps its capital in Russia, in the motherland. To keep capital in the place where it was earned and to use it to develop the Russian economy.\u0027\u0027Who is going to help them abroad? They are just persecuted there. Conditions are created making their work impossible. This is a big mistake by those, who are doing this in the West. All these restrictions, all this persecution of our businesses, their difficulties with dollar transactions, it damages the trust businesses from our country and others have in the economic policies of leading global economies. When the United States limits dollar transactions, this damages trust in the dollar.\u0027\u0027In essence, they are sawing the branch on which they are sitting. This is counterproductive and damaging for those involved and for the global economy.\u0027\u0027Some say we need to help Abramovich and other Russian businessmen who have ended up in a difficult situation. I wouldn\u0027t want to speak right now about those people who have broken various laws. I am speaking about people who acquired their capital through legal means. The former and the latter are better off being in Russia.\u0027 ON SANCTIONS\u0027This is a method by which to restrain Russia, the notorious sanctions, because endless accusations lay the groundwork for introducing restraining measures.\u0027\u0027It is because Russia is seen as a threat, because Russia is seen as becoming a competitor. I believe this approach is mistaken. Instead of restraining whoever it would be better to establish constructive cooperation, and then the overall effect on the global economy would be positive.\u0027\u0027It is clear to us that we have to defend our interests, and to do so consistently, not boorishly or rudely, in both the sphere of the economy and of defence. We have done so and we will continue to do so, but we always look for compromises, we aspire towards those compromises. The pressure will end when our partners will be persuaded that the methods they are using are ineffective, counterproductive and harmful to all.\u0027 ON STEEL TARIFFS\u0027The introduction, for example, of restrictive tariffs on steel, on aluminium, not only for Europe but also for Canada and Mexico, in essence these are also sanctionsâ¦ They are related to the pragmatic national interests of the United States.\u0027\u0027We need to work out united and consistently understandable and concrete rules on how to behave in the realm of security and in the realm of economic interaction.\u0027\u0027When in 2007 I spoke in Munich, a speech that is frequently quoted nowadays, I spoke about the fact that the United States is widening the jurisdiction of its laws beyond its national borders, and that this is unacceptable. And that\u0027s exactly what\u0027s happening now, also to our European and other partners. Why is this happening? No one wanted to listen and no one did anything to stop this from developing.\u0027          Critics say the event, which is being held days before Russia hosts the soccer World Cup, is a stage-managed piece of theatre designed to let Russians let off steam and fleetingly feel like they can influence a bureaucratic top-down systemON BALTIC STATES\u0027When it comes to the position of our compatriots in the countries of the Baltic, we are constantly talking about this, bringing it to the attention of the governments of the Baltic states, including Latviaâ¦ The measures that we take to protect the interests of our compatriots must be such that they do not actually worsen their situation.\u0027ON OTHER STATES\u0027 APPROACH TO U.S. SANCTIONS\u0027This is an important part of the negotiation process with the leaders of France, Germany, also with our Austrian friends, where I was visiting just now, and with the representatives of many other European countries, let alone Asia. They don\u0027t just say this privately now, they are talking about this publicly.\u0027\u0027It appears, our partners thought that this would never affect them, this counterproductive politics of restrictions and sanctions. But now we are seeing that this is happening.\u0027ON THE SOCCER WORLD CUP\u0027With regards to the infrastructure, these 11 stadiums. Of course, we spent a lot of money on this and it is imperative that all of this infrastructure, I completely agree, it must work and above all work towards the development of sport on a large scale, including children\u0027s sport.\u0027\u0027I would like right now to address my colleagues in the regions, to ask them to not allow, under any circumstances, for flea markets and the like to appear at these stadiums, as appeared in other sport-related buildings in Moscow during the middle of the 1990s.\u0027\u0027I think our Russian Football Union must play an active part in thisâ¦ and develop a new generation of sportsmen and soccer players.\u0027\u0027Even though our national team has not demonstrated strong results recently, but the number of fans of this beautiful sport here is massive, it\u0027s in the millions. We will rely on the fact that our soccer team will score a big win, so to speak, and will show its best qualities.\u0027ON THE ECONOMY\u0027Overall, we are moving in the right direction. What is the basis for saying this? We have started on the trajectory towards robust economic growth in Russia. Yes, this growth is humble, small, but it is also not a fall. Growth was at 1.5 percent last year.\u0027\u0027Not everyone feels this personally but overall, this is an objective statistic. That\u0027s how it is, it is the truth. Export in technical equipment is growing, which shows that some structural changes are going on in the economy. Export of agricultural produce, at 20 billion last year, was higher than defence exports, which were at 15 billion.\u0027          Putin and his aides say the phone-in is an indispensable tool to gauge public sentiment and learn what people\u0027s real problems areON TAXES\u0027Based on our preliminary calculations, we may in the next six years spend 17 billion roubles, but to achieve the goals that we have discussed, we will need an additional 8 trillion roubles. And it is clear where we are going to find them.\u0027\u0027Firstly, it is through the growth of the economy itself, that\u0027s the main source of additional resources. It is also the more effective use of existing resources, adjustment in some senses of our macro-economic plans and of course adjustments to our tax policy.\u0027\u0027Stability of tax policy must be absolutely guaranteed for the next six years.\u0027\u0027Many suggest changing the personal income tax. We thought about this for a long time. At first glance, progressive personal income tax seems and looks to be fairerâ¦ But reality is more complicated than theories and formulas.\u0027\u0027We had such a tax â a tax on revenue. This is a serious strain on the economy overall and in the end on citizens, because it inevitably leads to a rise in inflation. All this convinced us that introducing this was also not expedient.\u0027ON THE NEW GOVERNMENT\u0027The thing is, the development plan which we have been discussing in recent years, it was being prepared by the previous government during at least the past one and a half years. I know full well that if we were to replace the entire government 100 percent, and bring in totally new peopleâ¦ we would have lost at least two years, and we do not have those two years.\u0027\u0027But it was also necessary to keep those, who made the decisions for our country\u0027s progress. And to personalize responsibility for what has been done so far and for what is coming up soon.\u0027\u0027I think that we have an optimal make up of government for today.\u0027ON GASOLINE PRICES\u0027What is going on right now, it is unacceptable, it is wrong. However, it must be admitted that it is the result of inaccurate regulation, that was brought in recently in the sphere of energy, in energy resources.\u0027\u0027By the autumn of this year, additional measures should be introduced which will stabilize the situation on the market. I am basing this on the fact that the government will be monitoring this carefully.\u0027      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/13/4D011A0D00000578-0-image-a-1_1528373051647.jpg","title":"Striking pictures three bedroom bungalow Raheem Sterling lived child","story":"    Raheem Sterling\u0027s sprawling mansion in Jamaica\u0027s capital could not be further away from the cramped conditions of his childhood home            The footballing ace used to live with up to eight family members inside a three-bedroom bungalow in one of Jamaica\u0027s most crime-ridden areas But his youth was marred by gruelling hardship in Maverley — one of Kingston\u0027s most violent slums.  As a child, Sterling was rapidly showing his footballing potential - but would have to stop playing when gunshots rang out across Maverley.Today the footballing ace is surrounded by statues and ornamental fittings in the comfort of his sprawling mansion - for which he is thought to have paid £1million. He also owns a £3million mansion in Cheshire and was reported to be eyeing another in Marbella.  Sterling, 23, sparked outrage when he unveiled a tattoo of a machine gun on his leg, which he said was inspired by the killing of his father, Phillip Slayter.

The Scottish Borders council is implementing a trial in three schools – in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles – that will see secondary school pupils and other volunteers taking on roles in school libraries. The pilot initiative follows the loss of several librarian jobs last year, according to reports in the Scottish press, and has been attacked by local parents as well as by literacy experts, trade unions, teachers and librarians. Local parent Julie Caulfield said she and other parents were very concerned about the proposals.“The savings they are making are minimal compared to the negative impact this move will have on the education of our young people,” said Caulfield. “There is also the concern as to how students will manage and supervise the behaviour of peers and ensure pupil safety in the libraries … The suggestion that pupils will learn leadership skills from the experience is dressing up cuts as training opportunities.” For Eileen Prior, executive of parent and teacher charity Connect, “librarians do not just open the library door and check out books: they have the knowledge and skill to support learners in their study and research, and to support literacy skills”. The approach by the Scottish Borders Council “places an unrealistic expectation on fellow pupils”, she said. A spokeswoman for Scottish Borders Council said that the council remains “committed to maintaining library services for our pupils”.“There is a significant level of professional library input provided by a range of permanent staff across our secondary schools, as well as through a commissioned service, and again this is being maintained,” she said. “We are however undertaking a review to take into account the changing way in which pupils study and access information, including through digital solutions.” She added that a recent consultation with young people had found “they would prefer social and library spaces in their schools to be more pupil-owned and led”. The pilot scheme was therefore exploring “a different model of operation”, and would see the pupils “given the opportunity to train in leadership and other areas through taking on roles in school libraries and supporting their peers”.  “There are already good practice examples in some of our primary schools where younger pupils have been taking on the role of library ambassadors and we are keen to see opportunities like this extended to our older pupils,” said the spokeswoman. “The pilot will be reviewed before the end of 2018 and we will continue to consult with pupils, staff and trades unions throughout the process.” According to the Herald, a similar plan by East Renfrewshire council three years ago, aimed at saving £131,000, was shelved after protests. Research from Cilip and the all-party parliamentary group on libraries in 2014 found that there had been a loss of 280 school librarians in England between 2012 and 2014, while the School Library Association has estimated that its numbers have shrunk by at least 1,000 members since 2006, as under-funded schools try to save money by cutting their librarians. In November last year, authors including Philip Pullman and Neil Gaiman called on the secretary of state for education to halt the decline in school libraries or “consign a generation to a lifetime of low attainment and mobility”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e0113668e3794ead4baa621647f6aafc342fd90/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f47cb911481193771fe5366402e521a4","title":"house of fraser to close more than half of its british stores","story":"Department store chain will shut 31 outlets, including London flagshipHouse of Fraser is to close more than half its UK stores, putting a further 6,000 jobs at risk and dealing another hammer blow to the high street.The struggling department store group’s Oxford Street flagship in London and outlets in cities including Birmingham, Cardiff and Edinburgh are among the 31 facing closure.The move by the 169-year-old company is part of a rescue plan that will also lead to House of Fraser moving out of its head offices in London and Glasgow.Alex Williamson, the retailer’s chief executive, said it would close a distribution centre in Milton Keynes, threatening an unknown number of jobs. Without the proposed store closures, House of Fraser said the business was likely to collapse.“A decision to close this number of stores is not done lightly. This is really grim,” Williamson said. “It is a highly emotional, highly regrettable situation that none of us either imagined or wanted to see happen, but there is simply no alternative.”The House of Fraser chairman, Frank Slevin, said: “The retail industry is undergoing fundamental change and House of Fraser urgently needs to adapt to this fast-changing landscape in order to give it a future and allow it to thrive.“Our legacy store estate has created an unsustainable cost base, which, without restructuring, presents an existential threat to the business. “So while closing stores is a very difficult decision, especially given the length of relationship House of Fraser has with all its locations, there should be no doubt that it is absolutely necessary if we are to continue to trade and be competitive.”Dave Gill, national officer at the shopworkers union USDAW, said: “This is devastating news for House of Fraser employees. We are receiving calls from loyal and long-serving staff who are extremely worried, including those who work in brand concessions and are not directly employed by House of Fraser.” He added that although House of Fraser does not recognise Usdaw he had asked the retailer “ to engage in urgent talks, so that we can challenge the business case, investigate what can be done to save jobs and represent our members’ best interests.”The restructuring is a condition of a deal that will give control of House of Fraser to the Chinese C.banner business, which also owns Hamleys.House of Fraser’s CVA comes after a string of retailers and restaurant groups have used the process to close outlets, including Mothercare, Carpetright, New Look and Jamie’s Italian.It is feared House of Fraser could struggle to complete the CVA, as landlords and lenders have expressed concerns about a lack of consultation and that C.banner will not be able to inject sufficient cash into the business to turn it around.Williamson said management had been forced to take brave decisions, including closing some of its most high-profile stores, to try to ensure the business had a viable future. “There are too many case studies of CVAs that have not worked, and this is not going to be one of them,” he said.C.banner had committed to putting £70m into House of Fraser after the restructure, which he said was about creating a “sustainable platform” that would give shareholders and other stakeholders the confidence to continue investing in the business.The company has also put another £1m into its pension fund after discussions with trustees, who expressed concerns about protections for savers in the restructure. On Thursday, landlords called for an urgent government review of the rising use of CVAs, which they say risks undermining the UK’s reputation and deters investment in town centres.The British Property Federation said it believed the process was being misused.Melanie Leech, the chief executive of the landlords’ group, said: “The CVA process is intended to be part of a comprehensive business recovery plan. Property owners, looking after savers’ and pensioners’ money, will support businesses who demonstrate this commitment, but must protect those pensioners against unfair action that penalises their interests.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ba55d7c60816559c605c77215329eadec9cbb6d/29_65_5971_3583/master/5971.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7fc1e23713a902c5375fe42ceafaba2","title":"hard brexit theresa may mps eu withdrawal","story":"The Vote Leave campaign promised that Britain would “take back control”, and that Brexit would give the UK back its sovereign powers.If there is one thing we have learned from the progress of the EU withdrawal bill through parliament, it is that Theresa May is not interested in the sovereignty of parliament. Her government is hurtling headlong into a Brexit that could see the UK lose much control – over its borders, its trade with the world and its global standing.Theresa May has set out her red lines: leaving the EU customs union, leaving the single market, and no longer being subject to EU laws or rulings of the European court of justice (ECJ). In other words, a hard Brexit. If the prime minister cannot deliver tough restrictions on immigration into the UK, she knows that Brexit will have failed, tangibly, to do what she promised.Yet she is also unhappy with allowing parliament to scrutinise the government’s Brexit legislation because she knows this could threaten her wish for a hard Brexit at any cost.Scheduling just one 12-hour debate on 12 June to tackle 15 amendments to the Brexit bill put forward by the House of Lords, the prime minister seeks to avoid the kind of parliamentary involvement that might just leave the credibility of her strategy in ruins.May has chosen to sideline parliament before. In seeking to trigger article 50 without a vote in parliament, she attempted to exclude MPs and lords from the very start of the process.The lords’ proposals are not wrecking amendments. They would give the House of Commons a say over the UK’s continued membership of the customs union, the EEA, the single market and all the EU agencies. They would prevent the government from using Henry VIII powers to amend primary legislation as it is transposed from EU legislation into UK law.Other amendments would preserve the EU’s environmental protections in the UK, the principles of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the EU’s rules on asylum-seekers, passing these into British law too. The lords also amended the EU withdrawal bill to give parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal – or no deal.These are in the best interests of the country as a whole. And they help to maintain the delicate balance between the legislature and the executive, regardless of who is prime minister: Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn or even Jacob Rees-Mogg.So if May’s government is not interested in letting parliament consider the real alternatives, is it interested in “going global” or in increasing controls over the UK’s borders?Free trade with other bilateral partners will also face huge obstacles. According to an Open Britain report this week, it takes, for example, an average of three years and nine months to agree terms with the United States, and five years nine months to negotiate a deal with China.And, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, we will be forced to accept World Trade Organisation tariffs. Yet even this may not be the first problem that we face.Under legislation related to rules of origin, the EU may be forced to block UK-manufactured components and parts altogether and find other sources. Innovative border technology will not save UK manufacturers from this catastrophic loss of production orders from the EU.Negotiating freedom of trade requires us to make concessions on freedom of movement and yet we cannot possibly have a fairer deal on both trade and immigration than we already have inside the EU.EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.We have access to a market of 500 million people, while also being able to control who comes in and out of our country. EU legislation dating from 2004 even permits us to repatriate EU citizens who still lack a job or the means to support themselves three months after arriving in Britain.The House of Lords chose to challenge the government’s hard-Brexit plan in a spirit of respect, and belief that MPs in the House of Commons would show leadership in the democratic process that the EU withdrawal bill requires.If Theresa May believes in pushing through, with only minimal involvement of MPs, legislation for the most extreme form of Brexit, then she must take responsibility if her plan leads to catastrophe.• Lord Bilimoria is founder and chairman of Cobra beer, founding chairman of the UK-India Business Council and president of the UK Council for International Student Affairs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0602adc3bb1f3cf5fb9a7ca9d3b9add0ac4ea53/0_67_2407_1444/master/2407.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0049589f139287781b8989cbec2ba63e","title":"paul dacre gone daily mail next associated newspapers","story":"Asked for the winning formula of his Daily Mail, Lord Northcliffe replied: “I give my readers a daily hate.” No one has kept that flame burning more brightly than Paul Dacre, poisoner of the national psyche, bully-in-chief, whose iron whim has terrified prime ministers for a quarter of a century, and who has announced he will be stepping down as the paper’s editor in November.Like all bullies he targets underdogs, imposing on the country racism, homophobia and philistinism, and shunning complexity and evidence. His sheer bully-power often frames the national debate by warping broadcasters’ news agendas, because they know the Mail makes politicians quake. Theresa May – his candidate – caves in to him every time, as paralysed on paying for social care as on Brexit. His legacy is the great Brexit ide that has torn the country in two.Decades of straight-banana EU fabrications and myths sowed the seeds, but nothing was as shocking as his front pages in the referendum run-up, filled with dark-skinned migrants making bogus claims, criminals and terrorists heading this way.Dacre defenders point to his championing of the murdered Stephen Lawrence – son of Dacre’s decorator – as if one case wipes clean the regular racist filth.With no compass as to where the true middle lies – it’s around £27,000 – his own £2.5m salary plus £1.4m bonus may skew his understanding. So may his Scottish estate, where activities include deer-stalking and grouse shooting, and his Sussex cattle farm, for which he draws bundles in EU agricultural subsidy.His political modus operandi is to go for the jugular, to play the person, not the ball. It works: industrialists dare not put their head above the Brexit parapet for fear of the Mail lopping it off. When Gina Miller bravely went to the high court to secure parliament’s right to a Brexit say, he found no actual dirt, but called her “a gloating Guyana-born investment manager who alternates between glorying in self-promotion and complaining that her safety is under threat”. Thanks to Mail nastiness, she – like Stella Creasy and other Dacred women – faces death threats.Why do people – especially women – read it? There is a gobsmacking fascination with his outrageous headlines: how far will he go? Women are a favoured target, the Mail acting as playground bitch, forever papping celebrities putting on weight, spotted without makeup, revealing cellulite in a bikini.As editor-in-chief and chair of the Associated Newspapers board, his hot, fiery breath and sweary bollockings may bear down on his successor. As he reputedly frightens his proprietor, Lord Rothermere, Dacre may be the one to appoint an editor in his own image, just as he followed the moralising tics and toxic politics of his predecessor, David English.Optimists hope the sheer democracy-threatening anarchism of his recent assaults on the supreme court as “enemies of the people” has finally stirred Rothermere to rid us of this mania. The obvious replacement is the Mail on Sunday editor, Geordie Greig, friend of the Rothermeres and well-liked in moderate Tory circles. But long-term enmity between Dacre and Greig has exploded into print with the MoS’s robust remainer stance landing like an Exocet into the heart of Dacre’s daily.Who else? Mentioned is George Osborne, the London Evening Standard editor: Mail-hard on austerity, but like Greig sharing none of Dacre’s retro social conservatism. At least one cloud may be lifted: Dacre’s nostalgic miasma of an imagined 1950s in the days before orce, career women, single mothers, perverts and ethnic minorities caused our mortal moral decline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c42f4d663d9c5a8248467a075188c44d0850b94/74_0_2643_1586/master/2643.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7971083910804b17a9395bae8a3619c","title":"peter bradshaw scariest films ever hereditary","story":"Occult chiller Hereditary is the latest in a proud line of big-screen blood-curdlers. Our critic picks his 25 most terrifyingNow that Lars von Trier has offered what may be a backhanded homage to it in his serial-killer nightmare The House That Jack Built, attention may well refocus on this cult giallo classic from Italy. A journalist investigates a series of murders in a remote village and uncovers black-magic practices.Once upon a time, Bret Easton Ellis’s novel American Psycho was the most shocking thing in American publishing. Mary Harron’s movie version did not excite the same disgust, but it made Christian Bale into a star as the gym-built Wall Street master of the universe and status snob who is also a serial killer.A classic crude slasher from Tobe Hooper, in my view better than The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Four teenagers become trapped inside a haunted ride at a carnival and find themselves being picked off by the disfigured killer inside. Hooper weaponises his own fiendish bad taste with some truly grisly killing scenes.The explosion of digital movie-making 20 years ago – and the sudden availability of digital cameras at high-street prices – liberated film-makers and gave birth to the “found footage” genre. This is a movie whose cheeky viral marketing allowed people to think it was a genuine documentary. Three students hike into a forest, intending to make a supercilious video-diary history project about the local tradition of the “Blair Witch”. They are never seen again and this footage is all that is recovered.George A Romero invented the zombie genre with this smart, low-budget shocker about a virus, accidentally brought back to Earth from outer space, that causes people to eat each other, afflicted by an eternal hunger. It satirised racism, conformism, careerism and the country’s secret fear of the future.Ari Aster has barnstormed his way into the scary hall of fame with this deeply strange movie featuring Toni Collette as an artist and miniaturist who is haunted in every sense by her late mother, an abusive and manipulative woman who now wishes to gain control of her grandchildren from beyond the grave.A brilliant horror inspired by MR James’s story Casting the Runes. After sleeping with someone, a young woman discovers she has been inducted into a supernatural death cult she is being followed by a demonic figure that only she can see and which pursues her on foot at a zombie pace, but will eventually kill her – unless she has sex with someone else, at which point this demon’s target will change. And so it goes on: a viral chain-letter of sex and shame.An almost unclassifiable masterpiece of J-horror and one of the very few movies in the genre in which the demonically violent protagonist is allowed to be a woman, satirising women’s position in Japanese society and cinema. A film producer hits upon the idea for getting a wife: he will audition actresses for a (nonexistent) minor role and then, having found a suitably submissive woman, let her down and ask her for a date. The auditionee (Eihi Shiina) turns the tables on his arrogance with extreme violence.One of the great horror thrillers of contemporary US cinema and a brilliant allegory for the plot twist of the US post-Obama. An African American photographer (Daniel Kaluuya) is invited by his white girlfriend (Allison Williams) to spend the weekend with her super-liberal parents.One of the great movies about vampires, which Abel Ferrara reimagines as a parasitical cult of addiction, a pyramid scheme for spreading evil. Lili Taylor plays a lonely student in New York who is bitten and must then bite. Her agony in confronting her unwished-for destiny of eternal undeadness is brilliant.A masked attacker has escaped from a secure facility. It is the loathsome Michael, who has one of the most disturbing walks in film history: lumbering and laborious, and yet inexorable in his pursuit of Jamie Lee Curtis. The pioneering use of electronic music is part of what makes Halloween memorable: the plinking piano theme over a buzzing synth score.Frequently and misleadingly described as “the British Psycho”, this is the film that undid Michael Powell’s career – a serial-killer nightmare with strange echoes of his earlier film with Emeric Pressburger, A Canterbury Tale. Carl Boehm plays the deranged porn photographer and amateur cine-movie obsessive who films prostitutes at the moment he kills them. The sheer tattiness and seediness of postwar Britain is superbly conjured.A classic of English folk-horror: Edward Woodward plays the stolidly moralistic police officer who comes to a remote Scottish island community to investigate the case of a missing girl and is unsettled by the strange pagan practices. It is a society that has evolved separately from Britain’s mainland and its Anglican beliefs, but it looks like an alternative reality of fiercely insular, irrational England. Is there anything more Brexity than this?An eminent surgeon attempts a cosmetic reconstruction of his daughter’s face after she is disfigured in a road accident – using parts of faces of other young women that his assistant lures to his laboratory and kills. It is a horror movie in the tradition of Mary Shelley and yet also something of Beauty and the Beast, with the beastly father-figure turning his innocent daughter into something repulsive. Her mask is inexpressibly disturbing.Sissy Spacek is the bullied teen with telekinetic powers in this parable of bullying and misogyny, which is also a brilliant satire of high school, particularly the prom as a theatre of cruelty and anxiety. The violence and rage scream out of the screen.Jonathan Demme’s masterpiece of forensic psycho-macabre horror stars Anthony Hopkins, who brings a career’s worth of Shakespearean savvy to his greatest role: the imprisoned serial killer Dr Hannibal Lecter. Jodie Foster plays the FBI rookie Clarice Starling, who must convince Hannibal to offer invaluable help from behind his toughened glass in tracking down another murderer. But what will he want from her in return? A guignol gem.I have rewatched this a number of times and it just gets better, verging on classic status. A lonely and stressed young mother finds herself reading to her young son from a strange pop-up book he has found, called The Babadook, about a weird top-hatted figure that lives in the wardrobe. Too late, she realises that it is a satanically charged object and by reading it aloud she has made it come true.Stanley Kubrick’s gift for eerie grandeur is given free rein in this adaptation of the Stephen King novel (disliked by the author) about Jack Nicholson’s brooding writer, given the job as caretaker of an out-of-season hotel. There are sensational set pieces of horror and mystery: the lift shaft full of blood, the twin sisters appearing in the corridor.An elegant, sinister and scalp-prickling ghost story, based on Henry James’s story The Turn of the Screw. A governess, played by Deborah Kerr, takes charge of two children at a remote country estate and suspects that the house is haunted by the drunken valet and the former governess he seduced. She suspects the children can see these ghosts, too, and that these evil spirits have befriended them.There’s a remake on the way from Luca Guadagnino, and we have had many homages (from Darren Aronofsky’s Black Swan to Nicolas Winding Refn’s The Neon Demon), but here is the original and best. The extraordinary, operatic fantasy horror about a young American dancer discovering awful secrets at a German ballet school freaks out its audience with crazed intensity and eyeball-frazzling blocks of fierce colour.Low-key it may be compared with the jump-scare slashers, but this Ealing classic from 1945 is genuinely frightening: a portmanteau collection of five ghost stories, of which the most disturbing is probably the one directed by Alberto Cavalcanti, about a mad ventriloquist haunted by his dummy – a superb premonition of Psycho.One of the great event movies of the postwar era and an inspired exploitation nightmare that sensationally took Hitchcock – then in late middle-age – to the next level of cinematic greatness. Based on the novel by Robert Bloch – itself based on the grisly true story of the serial killer Ed Gein – it stars Janet Leigh as a realtor’s secretary who takes off with $40,000 in stolen cash and has to stay at a creepy old motel run by awkward Anthony Perkins, heading for a horrendous fate in the shower.William Friedkin’s horror masterpiece, the most famous of the devil-child wave made possible by Rosemary’s offspring, delivers a sledgehammer punch of fear – and a lumbar-puncture stab of horror. Max von Sydow plays a priest who is called in to cast out a devil occupying the body of a 12-year-old girl in Washington DC. The effects and prosthetics are still staggeringly good and the cataclysmic confrontation of good and evil is genuinely horrifying.For its sense of insidious and encircling evil, and the sensationally good performance from Mia Farrow, Rosemary’s Baby is unforgettable. Adapted by Polanski from the Ira Levin bestseller, it shows the demure, shy young title character (Farrow) moving in to a strange New York apartment building with her actor husband (John Cassavetes), becoming pregnant under strange circumstances and suspecting that a sinister satanic cult has designs on her baby.Nicolas Roeg’s magnificently disturbing ghost story, adapted by Alan Scott and Chris Bryant from the Daphne du Maurier short story, is an inspired combination of the erotic and the uncanny. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie give superb performances as the parents of a dead child who encounter, in Venice’s dankly crumbling splendour, terrifying signs of her existence beyond the grave. It is a meditation on time, memory, the poignancy of married love and the inexplicable mystery of death — and very scary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbee902dfafb2d1b11ffc5a03dc158b3d7efb158/0_237_4575_2744/master/4575.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16da6901e6cc6aa8641441780fa3d98c","title":"hope solo 2026 world cup united states bid soccer","story":"Olympic and World Cup champion Hope Solo wants her country to lose one of its biggest soccer contests: Fifa’s vote on the 2026 World Cup host. “I can’t say it should be awarded to Morocco,” Solo told the Associated Press. “But I don’t think it should go to the United States, and that’s hard to say.” By choosing to actively campaign against the US-led North America bid, Solo risks alienating herself further from the soccer community in her homeland. The bid leadership was exasperated when informed Solo was undermining their efforts heading into next Wednesday’s vote, dismissing her criticism of the governance of soccer but declining to go on the record in detail.Her stance is a counterpoint to the championing of the North American World Cup bid by David Beckham in a video released by MLS, where the former England captain is launching a team in Miami. That is only possible because Beckham secured a cut-price deal for an expansion franchise as part of his contract to play for the Los Angeles Galaxy.“That is not helping the sport in America,” Solo said. “I want to see promotion-relegation in the NASL and the MLS. Right now it’s true, you have rich ownership groups owning MLS teams and they’re only getting richer and they’re alienating everybody else.MLS stridently defended itself against Solo’s criticism, saying team owners have invested more than $3bn in stadium and training facilities to grow the sport because it’s a closed league.“The structure that we have has given owners certainty to make that type of investment,” MLS deputy commissioner Mark Abbott told the AP. “Had we had a system of promotion and relegation it would not have been possible to generate that level of investment from owners, local communities or private banks that help to fund some of these facilities.” Up to 207 soccer federations will vote next Wednesday in Moscow on whether North America or Morocco should host the 2026 World Cup, or the bidding should be reopened by choosing “none of the above.”“Hopefully Fifa can stand up and step in and say, ‘If we’re going to reward you, let’s look at everything and point out where you can fix certain things,”’ Solo said.

The nation is hoping that Mladen Krstajic’s star-studded squad can overcome a chronic mental fragility which has held them back in the past.Eight years on from a poor World Cup in South Africa in which they finished bottom of Group D, Serbia aim to ignore the similarities with that 2010 campaign – once again they won their qualifying group – and put in a mentally stronger and and more tactically astute display.The early signs do not offer the expected level of promise, however. Serbia seemed on course to reach Russia as comprehensive Group D winners in front of Wales and Republic of Ireland but a series of poor displays towards the end of the qualification campaign, equally poor player selection and a lack of tactical versatility from Slavoljub Muslin saw the experienced manager blamed, sacked and replaced by his assistant, Krstajic, despite Serbia qualifying as group winners.In an effort to distance himself from Muslin and his mentor’s fall, Krstajic introduced a number of tactical tweaks and called up the Lazio midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, whose untamed personality did not seem to fit with Muslin’s tranquil nature.Krstajic, a former Werder Bremen defender, had no such dilemmas about including the 23-year-old. “Our best players will always have a place in my team,” he said. “Sergej Milinkovic-Savic proved he can be counted on for the future and is bound to become the backbone of this squad.”With The Sergeant – as they call him in Italy – in a pivotal midfield position, Krstajic embarked on an Asian tour in November 2017 to prove that the Lazio man could be trusted to play alongside Manchester United’s Nemanja Matic and the Crystal Palace captain Luka Milivojevic. Milinkovic-Savic’s assist for Adem Ljajic – another one of Muslin’s disputed selection choices – in a 1-1 draw against South Korea was deemed more than enough proof that he will have an important role to play in Russia.Steering away from the 3-4-3 formation Muslin relied on for the most part of the qualifiers, Krstajic implemented the biggest change in defence. Regarded as the strongest part of Serbia’s team – along with the burgeoning midfield – a backline including Branislav Ivanovic and Aleksandar Kolarov was expected to help forge an impressive wall in front of the goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic. But Krstajic has shaken things up by introducing a 4-2-3-1 system and made Kolarov his captain, which raised a few eyebrows after Ivanovic was stripped of the armband.The striker is the one part of the team Krstajic will not be altering, with Aleksandar Mitrovic hitting swashbuckling form during his loan at Fulham. The Newcastle reject has come a long way in a matter of months since moving to London and could be Serbia’s biggest fear factor in Russia. He could be the player who glues together all the parts of the puzzle and provides the guts up front that Serbia have been sorely missing on the biggest stage.Which player is going to surprise everyone at the 2018 Fifa World Cup? Sergej Milinkovic-Savic has surprised everyone this season in Serie A, putting in one commanding display after another for Lazio. The 23-year-old dictates the play similarly to Paul Pogba – and has been linked with a move to Manchester United – but is also capable of playing further forward, just off the striker.Which player is likely to disappoint?Dusan Tadic. He must have been affected by some of the negativity surrounding him at Southampton this season and it could disrupt his flow at the World Cup. Tadic played a vital role in helping Serbia reach Russia but the creative midfielder is likely to be pushed further to the right as Krstajic looks to accommodate Milinkovic-Savic. This could easily be a blow to his confidence.What is the realistic aim for Serbia at the 2018 Fifa World Cup and why?The Serbian public tends to harbour bloated expectations about the national team’s chances. Traditionally the country has had high-class iniduals who have displayed a chronic lack of togetherness at major competitions. Players and fans consider qualifying for the knockout stage behind Brazil a minimum, and elimination at the last-16 stage might be publicly perceived as a huge underachievement.Milos Markovic writes for Sportske.net.Follow him on Twitter here.

Stojkovic started out at Red Star and, after a brief spell away, became the team’s No 1 during the 2005-06 season before joining Nantes at the end of that campaign. As a youngster he had also declared: “I wouldn’t join Partizan for all the money in this world. When you hate something it’s really that simple. My blood is red and white.”Those utterances – together with the fact that he was an honorary member of Red Star and a beloved favourite among the club’s ultras, Delije (Heroes), meant that the switch to Partizan (albeit only on loan from Sporting Lisbon) was deemed too difficult to take. But if the supporters who attacked the bus thought it would stop Stojkovic from playing for Serbia, they were wrong. “They thought I would never play again. But after that I was more determined than ever to prove them wrong. That’s when the T-shirt came to mind,” Stojkovic says, referring to the moment he further infuriated the Red Star faithful by revealing a shirt with the message of “please forgive my ugly past”. This came after the long-awaited Eternal Derby between Red Star and Partizan, less than two weeks after the notorious Genoa incident.His international dream – almost made a nightmare – started in 2006. A promising few matches for the French Ligue 1 side Nantes were followed by a downturn in form and a move to Vitesse Arnhem where Stojkovic also failed to prove his worth. The Portuguese giants Sporting came calling in the summer of 2007 with a five-year deal that was supposed to be a clear indication of their intentions. An early injury saw Stojkovic lose his starting spot to a young Rui Patricio, something he would never reclaim. Loan deals at Getafe and Wigan Athletic – where Stojković managed a combined nine league appearances – led to his return to Serbia. Stojkovic joined Partizan on loan before the club’s Champions League group stage campaign in 2010, and the move was made permanent a year later. Stojkovic was on a mission of his own when he arrived at Partizan. Unfit and with little to no playing time under his belt he suggested he might “temporarily step away from the national team”, arguably at the most inopportune moment as Serbia prepared to kick of their Euro 2012 qualification campaign. A commanding string of appearances for Serbia and Partizan put paid to that and after less successful spells at Ergotelis, Maccabi Haifa and Nottingham Forest, he returned to Partizan in 2017. The 34-year-old’s confidence is sky high going into the World Cup. He won the Serbian Player of the Year award for 2017, beating Nemanja Matic and Dusan Tadic, and will be travelling to Russia as the most-capped goalkeeper in Serbia’s history.All this should be more than enough motivation for the Partizan keeper to keep throwing punches towards those who continue to judge him.Milos Markovic writes for Sportske.net"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1e58b39c15a49c14ea592e86fad455c5e7b7595/0_353_4953_2971/master/4953.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4f5e9311fb9f198aaf4af7f8d50dd8e","title":"world cup groups a d preview football weekly","story":"Max Rushden is joined by voices from around the world to preview World Cup groups A-D, including Danish royalty, Peruvian vigour and the prospect of a tournament without a French meltdownRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Klotz’s “Swabian single malt whisky”, distilled near Stuttgart, is labelled as made in Germany. But the SWA argued that the use of the Gaelic term “glen” – a valley – could mislead buyers to think it was scotch.The ECJ said the German court must decide whether the “average European consumer” would make that error. It stressed that it was not enough for the word “glen” to evoke some kind of association with Scotland. It must actually bring to mind scotch whisky. But it did not matter, the court added, that the label said the product was made in Germany. However, the UK’s imminent departure from the EU has raised some questions about those protections. In principle, London and Brussels say they hope to continue recognising each other’s labelling rules, but negotiations are ongoing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42b2f0b933d273f4c8289f140f0a317220452480/0_33_3914_2348/master/3914.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaaf828641535cf927951a95750cbe92","title":"beyonce jay z otr ii tour review opening night cardiff","story":"Principality Stadium, CardiffOn the opening night of their collaborative world tour, the biggest couple in pop are glorious and charismatic – even if the romantic story arc plays down their traumaAs self-mythologising couples go, not many come close to Beyoncé and Jay-Z. The pair’s first collaboration, ’03 Bonnie and Clyde, was a tale of devotional love accompanied by a video featuring Beyoncé as the ride-or-die moll to her rumoured boyfriend’s gangster. It’s a story they’ve stuck to over the years – this is their second On the Run tour, and the theme remains intact: the film that punctuates this first night show introduces “the gangster and the queen” and keeps returning to an image of a hotel room carpeted with cash. Yet the intervening decade and a half – and an infamous few seconds of CCTV footage from an elevator – has complicated what was once a straightforward way to bolster each other’s brands. Far from living in codependent bliss, theirs is a relationship now defined in the public eye by betrayal and rage. As the pair detailed on their respective recent albums – Lemonade and 4:44 – Jay-Z was unfaithful, almost letting, as the guilty party put it, “the baddest girl in the world get away”.So the narrative has been recalibrated: the pair begin proceedings by hammering home the deathless nature of their love rather than its perfection. On a colossal screen, footage and slogans reinforce this idea of resilience, taking in a staged argument between the pair and never before seen pictures of their baby twins. The effect feels remarkably intimate for a stadium show, but also scrupulously posed – a tone that can feel disorientating as Beyoncé switches between songs about crazed lust and ballads about romantic betrayal (most starkly on 2006’s newly relevant Resentment). But anyone hoping for this psychodrama in cartoonish panto format would have been sorely disappointed. The pair gaze at each other moonishly from the get-go: a vision of matrimonial love that, considering they are explicitly cashing in on their interpersonal trauma, can come off as slightly one-dimensional.Which is not to say the show that services this message isn’t staggeringly impressive. The Beyoncé-mania that has gripped pop culture in recent years isn’t just poptimism gone mad: this is a woman who matches increasingly sophisticated and trailblazing material with once-in-a-generation onstage charisma. Her swagger is such that it can feel like the power dynamic between the two performers has been upended – once the sidekick, nowadays she’s the one taking her rapper husband for a ride as he hitches his wagon to her staggering cultural capital. At first, this shift is writ large: Jay-Z initially seems as though he’s keeping the stage warm for Beyoncé while she gets her breath back. By the end though, he’s not been outshone – mainly because of his arsenal of glorious modern classics (99 Problems, Niggas In Paris, Big Pimpin’) and perhaps partly because of his excessive costume changes, which put Beyoncé’s meagre half-dozen sequined leotards in the shade.Where Jay-Z does his hits justice, Beyoncé provides both the little treats – mouthing along to Jay’s raps showcasing a peerless range of screwfaces mercilessly barking “sing it” to her apparently lax fanbase – and a couple of heartstopping one-offs. She’s chameleonic, segueing from an imperious rendition of Lemonade’s Led Zeppelin-sampling Jack White collaboration Don’t Hurt Yourself to operatic singing, flanked by her dancers in a renaissance tableaux. During Sorry, she pauses midway through to turn the lyric “suck on my balls” into a faintly chilling haka-style refrain (hilariously, the song is followed by Jay-Z’s deeply-ironic-in-the-circumstances 99 Problems).While Beyoncé’s recent shows have been characterised by identity and politics – her Coachella performance celebrated black college culture her Superbowl show paid tribute to the Black Panthers – that’s not the MO here. But the slivers of material in that department are worth waiting for. Excerpts from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s We Should All Be Feminists speech gets pride of place on the massive screen Sorry is punctuated by Beyoncé asking women in the audience whether they’ve “had enough”, in highly charged fashion. Jay-Z takes the mantle when it comes to race, airing the video for 4:44’s The Story of OJ after a female dancer twists and turns to Nina Simone’s Four Women.The pair bow out with their evergreen 2003 hit Crazy In Love, a rendition of Jay Z’s Young Forever, and a film that sees them reconvene at the altar. It is hard to digest this smooth romantic arc when everyone knows how fraught their relationship has been – but that feeling is offset by the sheer majesty of their creative partnership, which surely only death could do part."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5553981a1899c96e9cf0fc9f4436a0c62fe6742/0_0_4928_3280/master/4928.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=85b57b5f547af97a14acb7fc80f2ae82 1400w","title":"former brexit minister says mays backstop plan extremely damaging for britain politics live","story":"Michel Barnier joined by Guy Verhofstadt in questioning plan unveiled on Thursday. Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenAn independent review into the impact of policing during the miners’ strike of the 1980s is to be carried out in Scotland, the Press Association reports. Michael Matheson, the Scottish government’s justice secretary, announced the move in Holyrood, telling MSPs: “I am determined that the Scottish government should do what it can to do right by those affected by the dispute.” The UK government has already ruled out an inquiry into the violent confrontations between police and striking miners in Orgreave, South Yorkshire, in 1984. Matheson said doing nothing was not an option for him as he urged new home secretary, Sajid Javid, to follow his example. John Scott QC will lead the inquiry, which will make its recommendations by June next year. It will look at “the impact of policing on affected communities in Scotland” between March 1984 and March 1985.In his statement Matheson said:Through this independent review, Scotland will lead the way in ensuring the experiences of those affected by the policing of the dispute in the 1980s are properly understood.This represented an extremely turbulent and difficult time for many mining communities in Scotland. And although more than three decades have passed, the feelings and scars from that time still run deep and there are questions that still need to be answered. I want this review to bring openness, understanding and a degree of closure to all those involved. At the same time, I have written to the home secretary to ask that he seriously reconsider the UK government’s position at this point - only a UK-wide investigation could fully explore concerns about the involvement of the then UK government.The DUP Commons leader Nigel Dodds told the BBC in Northern Ireland today’s backstop deal was a “massive step forward” because it extended the regulatory alignment to the whole of the UK while negotiations on the final trade relationship were ongoing.“Theresa May has stuck to her word that no PM could countenance a border in the Irish Sea ... our red line has not been breached,” he told Sky News in Ireland.Dodds met May yesterday, in contrast to December when the DUP were not taken into the prime minister’s confidence and threatened to torpedo the Brussels-London deal.According to the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn, some in Number 10 have been declaring victory over David Davis.This is from my colleague Daniel Boffey, the ’s Brussels bureau chief.Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead spokesman on Brexit, has now posted a tweet about the UK’s Brexit backstop plan. He is raising the same concerns as Michel Barnier (see 2.02pm) and the Irish government (see 3.28pm), but he is more blunt that Barnier, implying that what was published today is not a “workable solution”.Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale urged Nicola Sturgeon to raise Northern Ireland’s abortion ban with DUP leader Arlene Foster when she visits Scotland at the end of the month. Speaking during first minister’s questions on Thursday lunchtime, Dugdale called for a travel bursary to be introduced for women travelling from Northern Ireland to access abortion services which the Scottish government made free to them last November.Sturgeon said that she had “no plans” to meet Foster, who will be leading an Orange Order march in Fife on July 30. She added that the Scottish government would continue to look at how to make it easier for Northern Irish women to access abortion services in Scotland, and expressed her hoped that, once the Northern Ireland Assembly was up and running again, it would address abortion rights swiftly.It’s a tricky position for Sturgeon, who has always been resolutely pro-choice, but is unlikely to want to lend her support to the Westminster government essentially imposing abortion reform on a devolved administration. Of course there is the argument that there is currently no administration, and that human rights trump devolution, but it would set a dangerous precedent from the SNP’s perspective. I’d be curious to know how many SNP MPs support Stella Creasy’s campaign.Ireland’s prime minister Leo Varadkar dismissed the idea of a time-limited backstop earlier today.Using a phrase the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier used in a subsequent tweet (see 2.02pm), Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that the backstop had to be an insurance policy for “all weather” not just for the UK’s convenience. He said:The principle that is in the existing backstop that is supported by the 27 EU member states is that it applies at least until there is an alternative in place. It is not something that can be just time limited.Varadkar was speaking just before the backstop paper was published in London. He went on:It has to be as they say ’all weather’, it has to be applicable until such a time if and when there is a new relationship between the EU and UK that prevents a hard border.This flatly contradicts the UK government document, which clearly says the backstop should be time limited. Although paragraph 26, about ending the backstop in December 2021, is provisional (“the UK expects”), paragraph 6 is clear that there should be some sort of time limit. (See 1.44pm.) It says:This temporary arrangement would only come into force following the implementation period, in specific and narrow circumstances, such as a delay in the implementation of the end state customs arrangement, and would be time-limited.Sky’s Lewis Goodall thinks David Davis hasn’t come out of it all that badly.Here is the Irish government’s statement on the UK’s new plan for the Brexit backstop. It is from Simon Coveney, the foreign minister and deputy prime minister. He says there must be “substantial progress” on the backstop plan by the time of the EU summit at the end of June.It’s not easy coming up with a reliable analysis while the story is still unfolding. ITV’s Robert Peston posted a snap Facebook analysis saying “Davis has won.” But he has been adding various PSs, revising his view, culminating with one saying: “Even Davis’s closest friends concede he blinked.” Not easy, this live news stuff. To his credit, Peston has left it all up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22a30f81b9976029ed2f9ba691fbd8188c36e728/423_85_1881_1128/master/1881.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=487aca6ceb4fcbc02f74db115e1f3831","title":"brad shields bench england rugby union squad test match south africa","story":"England have fast-tracked the New Zealand-reared Brad Shields straight into their matchday squad for the first Test against South Africa in Johannesburg on Saturday. The 27-year-old Hurricanes captain, who is qualified though his English parents, has been named on the bench after only a handful of training sessions with his new team-mates.Only last Friday the uncapped Shields was playing Super Rugby against the Highlanders in Dunedin and, having grown up in Wellington, has yet to play rugby in England. Normally a back-row forward, he has been invited to provide second-row cover after Joe Launchbury, as expected, failed to recover in time from a calf problem.Saracens’ 20-year-old lock Nick Isiekwe will now make his first Test start and England’s head coach Eddie Jones has also made some other interesting calls. Mike Brown is named on the wing, Elliot Daly will wear 15, the talented Henry Slade has been given the nod at 13 and Saracens’ scrum-half Ben Spencer is in line for a first cap off the bench ahead of Wasps’ Don Robson.Jones will be relying on the Vunipola brothers, Maro Itoje, Jamie George and skipper Owen Farrell, all of whom were Test regulars for the British \u0026amp Irish Lions in New Zealand last summer, to supply a steely spine but there are changes in every key area of the team compared with the side which started England’s last Six Nations game against Ireland.Shifting Brown to the wing did not conspicuously work against the Barbarians at Twickenham last month but the management are clearly keen to see if Daly can offer a fresh attacking dimension from full-back. “We want to do something special on this tour and the players are all incredibly excited about this challenge and opportunity we have,” said Jones. “Ellis Park is the spiritual homeland of South African rugby and the Springboks play to another level on that ground, so we know we have to raise our game physically early on and be enormously accurate in the way we play.”South Africa, meanwhile, have named three new caps in a relatively inexperienced starting line-up containing just 320 Test caps, led by their first black Test captain Siya Kolisi.

They’re hitting moon balls at each other on the next point, but Keys clearly prefers to play with power. She gets a little over-anxious and it’s 30-all. A netted forehand from Keys and Stephens has game point. And Keys has the sound of the ball hitting the net ringing round her ears again. Stephens, having started to look a little edgy despite leading by a break, holds.Keys holds to stay in touch. Despite being a break down, she’ll be much happier with how she’s playing here compared to last year’s US Open final. An overrule on the opening point. The umpire once again is out on court inspecting the clay – she’d be sitting more comfortably in her chair if the tournament used Hawk-Eye – and her overrule stands. Stephens is tested for the first time on serve, as Keys navigates her way to break point at 30-40. Stephens snuffs out the danger. Deuce. Advantage Keys, a second break point. Keys has the chance to pull the trigger with her return on a second serve – and nets. She shrieks in frustration. Deuce. Advantage Stephens. Jeu Stephens, as Keys batters well beyond the baseline. Keys’s errors are outnumbering the winners at the moment. Keys does have her strong serve to rely on though. Ace No 3 and No 4 get her to 40-30, and she slams down the smash for the game. Currently being discussed on the Eurosport commentary: how difficult it is for the crowd to pick which player to get behind here. Which American do they go for? Stephens and Keys play a similar game too, with their powerful groundstrokes, although Stephens’s movement is better and, if she moves Keys around, she knows errors may follow. That approach gets Stephens to 40-15 on serve, and she consolidates the break as Keys’s error count hits seven.Anything Keys can do – Stephens holds to 15 as well. Keys then cranks up the power on serve, charging to 40-0, before Stephens surges back to deuce. After two comfortable holds, this contest is getting going. Stephens soaks up a powerful serve and brings up the first break point of this semi-final. A sizzling Stephens forehand catches the outside of the line – the umpire is out of her chair to confirm the call – and it’s Stephens with the early strike.Keys has one of the best serves in the women’s game behind Williams and she moves smoothly into a 40-15 lead in the opening game before holding. She’ll be pleased with that after the nightmare in New York. There won’t be many too surprises here, they know each other’s game so well, it could come down to who executes best. The pressure is more on Stephens as the US Open champion.Keys says that US Open final already feels “like 12 years ago”, adding: “I obviously rely on what I learned there and how to manage my emotions and manage the moment. ... It feels completely different here. I have actually been told quite often that I’ll never win or do well because I’m too nice of a person. I think that’s a load of crap. I don’t think you have to be mean in order to win matches. I think there’s a difference between being intense and wanting it and fighting and just not being nice, so that’s something that I have always stayed true to.”As for Stephens, she says: “I think for both of us, that was the biggest moment of both of our careers, playing in the finals of the US Open. I think a lot has happened since then. We are both playing well, in the semis of a grand slam. It’s great for American tennis. To have two Americans in the semi-finals of the French Open, is pretty incredible. That means one American will be in the final of a French Open, which is another amazing thing. All in all, I don’t think anyone can complain.”Well, except perhaps the loser.Right, next up it’s Madison Keys v Sloane Stephens, and they’re already out on court warming up. For all the talk of Serena Williams in the first week, Keys and Stephens are the last Americans in Paris. And they’re still good friends despite Stephens taking lumps out of Keys in the 2017 US Open final, when Stephens won 6-3, 6-0 for her first grand slam title. It’s the first time two American women have met in the last four at Roland Garros since Williams beat Jennifer Capriati in 2002.A top performance that was from Halep, arguably one of the finest of her career. Her defence was terrific but she attacked so forcefully too. She was hitting the ball as hard as Muguruza out there. And for all the questions about the mental side of her game, she was nerveless in that second-set denouement. I’m really, really happy that I won this match. It was really important for my mind to know I could win against a great opponent. It’s a pleasure to play here. I’m happy to play the final again at my favourite grand slam. I’ll try my best and hopefully do better than last year.After the neverending ninth game, the end is in sight. Halep is charging through the points and is potentially two away at 0-30. She’s perhaps only one point away at 0-40. Triple match point. Muguruza batters a backhand long and Halep is into the final! The two-times runner-up has given herself another shot at winning the title! Victory means she retains the world No 1 ranking too.... A one-two punch from Muguruza in front of the watching Mike Tyson but still Halep gets it back – before Muguruza puts away the smash! Advantage Muguruza, a break point that would leave the Spaniard serving to level the match. The pair trade blows down the middle, neither is willing to budge, but eventually Muguruza surrenders! Deuce No 5. Followed by break point No 2. Halep – on the run – dispatches Muguruza’s return for the winner! Deuce No 6. Break point No 3. Muguruza completely misses a low ball that doesn’t bounce! And Halep then holds! Utterly engrossing. Muguruza must hold serve to stay in the match.At 40-15, Halep performs the splits, a pirouette and then is flying through the air in an attempt to get the ball back – I think even her compatriot Nadia Comaneci would give her a perfect 10 for artistic effort – but Muguruza wins the point. And the next. From 40-15 it’s deuce. A break for Muguruza here would leave her serving for the set. Halep gets to advantage but then is hauled back to deuce. Some top-class defence and it’s Halep’s advantage again. But there’s her third double fault. Deuce. Could this be a pivotal moment in the set? Advantage Halep. Deuce. The game’s been going for eight minutes ...At 15-all, Muguruza makes a mess of the short ball. 15-30. 15-40, when Halep just finds the sideline with a whipped forehand winner. Two break-back points. Perhaps this match won’t go to a decider after all. An errant backhand from Muguruza and there’s the break! They’re back on serve. Muguruza will be kicking herself after all the work she put in to forge ahead in this second set.Fancy some Nadal v Schwartzman highlights? Sure you do.As the intensity increases, so does the noise that both players are making. @PseudoFed doesn’t seem too impressed. Halep stays in touch with the hold.Halep is huffing and puffing after her effort whistles wide. 15-0. 30-0. 30-15, after a deft touch from Halep at the net. A baseline duel follows, Halep slightly mistimes her forehand and is standing there almost willing it to go in, but it plops wide. 40-15. Game Muguruza.At 5ft 6in, Halep is giving away a full six inches to Muguruza, but she’s attempting to stand tall here in the face of the current Wimbledon champion’s fightback. She holds to 30 but still finds herself a break down.Halep looks to have shaken off that negativity and, for the first time in this match, this really feels like a contest. Muguruza gets to 40-15 on serve but a second backhand winner of the day for Halep leaves Muguruza’s feet stuck in the clay. The Spaniard didn’t even move for that. Muguruza goes long and it’s deuce. Then Halep’s advantage. The pair go down the middle, Halep then moves Muguruza wide, but the Romanian goes on to net. Deuce. Halep is furious with herself but she gets another chance to break after Muguruza fires into the tramlines. Halep loops long! Egalité deux. And from there Muguruza holds to consolidate the break, ending with a stinging serve out wide.Muguruza rallies and holds to 15. Halep hurries to 15-0 on her serve, before Muguruza moves to 15-all and then does her best to get rid of a set of frustration with three big, clean hits in the next point. Even Halep’s defence eventually breaks down. 15-30. 15-40, two break points. This makes things a bit more interesting. Muguruza breaks and Halep is using her racket to clap sarcastically at herself. She could really do without engaging in a mental battle with herself here.The court has been swept – as it always is between sets at Roland Garros – so it’s something of a fresh start for Muguruza. But it’s the same old story on the first point. And the second. Halep leads 30-0 on serve and Muguruza is cutting a disconsolate figure between points. She can’t figure out a way to penetrate Halep’s defence. Every. Single. Ball. Is coming back. So much for David Ferrrrrreer having the nickname of the Wall. I think he should hand it over to Halep. There again she’s almost playing like the Novak Djokovic of old. Call her Novak Halep. 40-0. 40-15. Game. There is almost certainly too much for Muguruza to do in this set but at least it’ll give her something to build on at the start of the second. 15-all turns into 30-all. Halep is left slapping her thigh after a backhand skids wide. 40-30. Halep’s return clips the net and drops in, bamboozling Muguruza, whose effort hits the net post and flies back at her. Deuce. Advantage Halep, a first set point. And it’s not only the Romanians in the crowd who seem to be cheering. She’d be a popular champion given her heartbreak in previous years. Deuce. Advantage Halep, a second set point. And Halep rounds off a terrific set of tennis with a forehand winner!I must admit I didn’t see this coming. Given the way Muguruza dominated Sharapova yesterday, I thought she’d have too much power for Halep. And usually once Muguruza gets going at a grand slam, she’s virtually unbeatable in the later stages. Muguruza gives Halep something to think about at 30-all, and Halep is left to ponder a break point after the next exchange. 30-40. Jeu Muguruza. It’s taken 30 minutes but Muguruza is on the board.As they’ve just said on the Eurosport commentary, when Halep is playing like this, it’s not hard to see why she’s the world No 1. But then the doubts can creep in, last year’s French Open final being a case in point, when she led Jelena Ostapenko, the unseeded first-time grand slam finalist, by a set and 3-0 before blinking near the finish line. Can she keep those nerves in check today? She’s not showing any sign of weakness in this first set, bringing up a break point at 30-40. A good second serve from Muguruza and it’s deuce. But Muguruza just can’t hit through Halep, whose wall-like play gives her another break point. And it’s 5-0 in 25 minutes. Halep will serve for a first-set bagel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69881e930a58569e24bfb43b5bb0ba054993b259/0_176_5292_3175/master/5292.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24fa1bccb404d423bd3f74263f7535d7","title":"my name is lucy barton review laura linney triumphs as a writer confronting her past","story":"Bridge theatre, LondonElizabeth Strout’s novel works outstandingly on stage, thanks to sole performer Linney’s nuanced command of the narrativeNovels, depending on the stream of time, rarely make good plays. Elizabeth Strout’s first-person narrative, longlisted for the Man Booker prize in 2016, however, breaks the rules and fits perfectly on the stage. That’s partly because of the quality of the writing and partly because of a beautifully nuanced solo performance by Laura Linney: a space that recently looked underpopulated with a four-character play, suddenly feels colonised by Linney’s commanding presence. Fans of the book will know that it is the reminiscence of a writer hospitalised for nine weeks in New York by a mysterious illness. But the focus is on five days when the eponymous heroine renews acquaintance with her mother, who has come to visit her from rural Illinois and from whom she has been long estranged. The two women talk, gossip about people from Lucy’s past, warily seek each other’s love. In the end, the mother departs as abruptly as she came and you feel the two women have briefly bonded without ever addressing their shared guilt: in the mother’s case, over Lucy’s impoverished childhood and, in Lucy’s, over her own necessary desertion.It sounds slight: in fact, it’s a story full of mysterious resonances. What comes out in performance, even more than in reading the book, is the idea that, even if you totally reinvent yourself, your past remains inescapable. Lucy has sought to overcome a childhood in which she and her siblings were beaten and deprived of the consolations of TV, films and magazines. Her father, who fought in the second world war, suffered from what we would now call post-traumatic stress disorder. Fleeing Illinois, Lucy has settled in New York, married, had children and acquired the ruthlessness that is part of a successful writer’s equipment. Yet, as Lucy admits, the Barton family provided a structure she was unaware of, until it was ended by death. Although I was sorry not to hear more of Lucy’s literary mentor, Sarah Payne, Rona Munro’s adaptation is sensitive to Strout’s structure. Richard Eyre’s production also has a distilled clarity: Bob Crowley’s set consists of a hospital bed and chair, while Luke Halls’s video design modulates between vistas of the gleamingly geometric Chrysler building and Illinois acres of soybeans and corn, which seem to stretch to infinity. But it is Linney who triumphantly carries the evening. I’d seen her once before on stage, in Eyre’s Broadway production of The Crucible, where she caught perfectly Elizabeth Proctor’s puritan severity. Here she switches easily between different modes. She talks to us, the audience, with warmth and ease. When she characterises Lucy’s mother, prattling on about the marital misfortunes of sundry relations, her voice acquires a rasping, midwestern edge. As Lucy relives her hospital memories, Linney is even more extraordinary: she shifts between exasperated fury at her mother’s wilful incuriosity and loving astonishment at this unworldly old woman’s ability to negotiate labyrinthine hospital corridors and the New York jungle. You can see the story in several ways but it is partly about the enforced loneliness of the writer who, at the same time, reinforces our common humanity. Linney, as a performer, has mastered the art of public solitude and gives you the uncanny feeling that you are listening not to an invented story but a slice of lived experience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dfe838e61dbf86dd51293d289f1466782d89e3e/355_981_4210_2527/master/4210.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3fb9524705a26ceddb59b0e72d228d4","title":"sophie treadwell machinal ruth snyder almeida london","story":"When Rebecca Hall read it she couldn’t breathe. After Fiona Shaw played the role she got letters full of loneliness. This is the true story behind Sophie Treadwell’s trailblazing playIn 1927, Ruth Snyder dominated America’s headlines. Accused of murdering her husband, she became the first woman in New York state to die in the electric chair. The press slavered for stories about her photographer Tom Howard even smuggled a camera into her execution chamber at Sing Sing. His picture of Snyder, hooded and restrained, was splashed over the Daily News under the headline: “Dead!”Journalist Sophie Treadwell didn’t miss a day of the trial, although she wouldn’t report on it. Snyder’s husband was murdered for his life insurance and the case inspired the novel Double Indemnity by another reporter, James M Cain. But Treadwell took Snyder’s story and created a claustrophobic panorama of the American nightmare. Her play Machinal shows its heroine – referred to simply as Young Woman – to be lonely in marriage and motherhood. Bliss briefly blooms with a lover, but only leads to the chair.Lyndsey Turner revived Machinal on Broadway in 2013 and lauds “the way Treadwell follows, with brutal, inexorable logic, the journey of an unremarkable woman through a series of encounters which lead her to commit a remarkable act”. Every aspect of Snyder’s intimate life had been picked over in print Turner argues that Howard’s image of the accused, “sitting dead in an electric chair for all the world to see, must have struck Treadwell as obscene. Even in death, Snyder was regarded as public property.” “Because it was a story people knew, Treadwell could be incendiary,” argues Natalie Abrahami, who directs the Almeida theatre’s production opening this month. “She could hold the mirror up and say: ‘This is the world. Is this the way it should be?’” The question has lingered through the intervening 90 years, especially around women struggling to be heard. “I don’t imagine that when she wrote it in 1928 she thought that it would have such resonance now.”A decade before Machinal’s extraordinary success (the young Clark Gable played the lover on Broadway, and it was also a West End hit), Treadwell won a reputation in journalism. “Treadwell’s interests in journalism and theatre emerged simultaneously,” explains Jerry Dickey of the University of Florida. “In her early days as a reporter in San Francisco, she was prodded by her editor to engage in stunt reporting – Treadwell used her talents as an actress to assume a fictional persona and do undercover investigations.” She caused a sensation in 1915, posing as a prostitute to expose hypocritical charitable institutions.“I don’t believe there is an editor in America who would dare turn down anything that you write in France,” wrote her boss in San Francisco during the first world war. Women were discouraged from reporting from the frontline, but Treadwell travelled under a safe conduct pass. In Mexico, she scored an exclusive interview with Pancho Villa (inspiring her 1922 melodrama Gringo) in America she investigated factory work, equal pay and immigrant communities. Journalism offered access, and as in her drama, says Dickey, “she typically gravitated to the outcast, the poorly understood, the unconventional”.Dickey sees her reporter’s sensibility in Machinal: “She describes it much as she did in her previous newspaper accounts – with attention to the physical details of the woman defendant’s behaviour and the coarseness of the male jury and judicial system.” However non-naturalistic, Machinal retains a journalist’s feel for distilling a story to its juicy essence. Abrahami notes that “Snyder and her lover Judd Gray were tried as a couple, but he is edited out … She makes sure you see the machine, the structure of society.”Part of the play’s modernist audacity is in the soundscape Treadwell specifies. Clattering typewriters, deafening construction, the radio’s incessant chat and croon. They might suggest a metropolis bustling with opportunity – but they oppress the heroine, drowning her voice and squeezing her thoughts. To Turner, they “evoke a machine working at full speed”.Machinal premiered a year before the Wall Street crash demonstrated that the machine of American capitalism wasn’t infallible. “The play gives the lie to the image of the 1920s as a decade of unprecedented freedom,” argues Turner. “It’s a savage indictment of a society whose pursuit of efficiency and prosperity leads to a woman becoming trapped in the very machines designed to liberate her.”As I sit with Abrahami at the Almeida, the desk is awash with printouts from Treadwell’s archive at the University of Arizona. “If the writer was here, I’d ask loads of questions,” she explains. “When the writer is dead, I don’t know how to do that, other than by going through all the drafts to understand their process.” Leafing through the sheaves (“her handwriting is so beautiful”), she charts the play’s “juggernauting through these stages of life – daughter, wife and mother. It feels cinematic – the forward momentum is so extreme.”Abrahami traces the dialogue’s emerging musicality: “It’s written in the jazz age and has those syncopated rhythms.” The heroine struggles with the caffeinated chatter of the opening office scene. Her agitated interior monologues, built from shards of distress, “feel like a new form – I’ve never read anything like it”.When Rebecca Hall first read the script, she felt like she “couldn’t breathe for a minute”. Hall played the lead for Turner, who considers that “it takes a great deal of humanity, craft and courage to play a character who isn’t allowed to act on her own behalf.” Fiona Shaw, who led the last major British revival, directed by Stephen Daldry at the National Theatre in 1993, describes the challenge differently: “To play a not particularly interesting, not particularly good person. The morality of the evening doesn’t lie in her hands.”“It’s so brave,” Shaw reflects. “It gets right down to the bone.” Daldry and designer Ian MacNeil created a forbidding set that revolved, loomed and sank, stomping over the heroine’s sensibilities. But “in my mind I was in an empty room” says Shaw. She reached back to childhood for a telling gesture of the heroine’s loneliness. “I raised and kissed my own knee when she was getting ready for bed – because she had never been kissed.” She remembers the unusual amounts of mail she received from audience members – “men as well as women” – identifying with that isolation. Abrahami says: “I’m interested in unearthing the empowerment of the next generation. In the final scene the Young Woman says about her daughter, ‘Let her live!... There’s so much I want to tell her.’ Sophie Treadwell is talking to us from the grave, asking: are we letting women make the choices they need to make?”Abrahami indignantly brandishes an encyclopedia of American theatre. “There’s pages on Eugene O’Neill, but just one line on Sophie Treadwell: she wrote Machinal.” It can be hard to judge why her other plays didn’t gain traction. She wrote about Mary Wollstonecraft and Edgar Allan Poe: the latter script was designed for star actor John Barrymore, whom she sued when, as Abrahami tartly observes: “It appeared miraculously as a play written by his wife under a different title.”Seven of her dramas played on Broadway. Dickey says Treadwell “often wrote about characters that in some ways resembled herself – unconventional, uncompromising and filled with contradictions. With the exception of Machinal, Broadway audiences and producers consistently had difficulty empathising with Treadwell’s central characters.” Treadwell largely abandoned theatre and then journalism, after reporting from Mexico during the second world war and from devastated Germany in 1949: that same year, aged 69, she adopted a German baby. She spent her last years in Arizona and died in 1970. Everyone I interview wishes she had wider recognition. “She seems to me completely ahead of her time,” Abrahami insists. “A beacon. What I sense in the writing is her drive. If she wants to report from the frontline, she’s going to the frontline. She wants to go to Mexico? She’ll do that. She strikes me as a forthright person who saw the world as it was and wanted to say something about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82c90726839a6e90168dfe6ecba072f16e38618d/0_0_3675_2205/master/3675.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=199b98df08344ecccb5431473cee3e25","title":"marshall major iii bluetooth review wireless headphones","story":"The much-loved British brand has improved its wireless on-ear range, perfect for metal and hip-hop heads alikeThe Marshall Major III Bluetooth headphones are the latest in the much-loved British audio brand’s wireless headphone range, and while the changes are minor over the last pair they are still a winning combination of look, sound and battery life.You’d be hard pressed to notice the difference at first glance between 2016’s Major II Bluetooth and the new Major III Bluetooth. But compare them side by side and you realise they are slimmer and better looking, maintaining the classic Marshall styling in black vinyl.In fact, the new headphones are 24g lighter, which combined with softer ear pads make them a touch more comfortable to wear. They still squeeze my head pretty hard, but the top band does give a bit so they will eventually wear in.They are on-ear headphones, meaning they sit directly on your ear, not around it. The arms are slimmer and simplified, but maintain their height, twisting and tilting degrees of freedom so that they sit flat against your ear. The controls have been simplified for the Major III, with the brilliant gold-coloured metal joystick at the bottom of the left phone taking over all functionality. Hold it in for a few seconds to turn them on or off, press it once to pause or play the music, twice to trigger Google Assistant or Siri, tilt it left or right to skip the track and up or down to adjust volume. It all works very well, making you wonder why so many other manufacturers don’t have a similar control scheme.The Bluetooth connection is strong in all scenarios and supports aptX for higher fidelity and lower latency streaming with modern Android smartphones. Pairing is easy – just hold down the joystick for a few more seconds when powering the headphones on and find them on your phone.A standard 3.5mm analogue headphone socket is in the right ear cup for listening wired or when the battery runs out.The Major headphones have always sounded good with rock and similar genres, but the Major III Bluetooth suit a wider range of music types. They still sound great with driving rock music, but feed them something slightly more subtle such as the live version of Hotel California by the Eagles from Hell Freezes Over and you can hear good separation, punchy bass drums and clear vocals. The sound is very direct and those looking for thundering bass will have to look elsewhere. But the Marshalls make anything sound good, from Librarian by My Morning Jacket and Do I Wanna Know? by the Arctic Monkeys at the indie-rock end of things, to hip-hop tracks such as Dr Dre’s Forgot About Dre or Can’t Take It With Me by Blue Sky Black Death.The new Marshalls lasted well over 30 hours in my testing, making them some of the longest-lasting Bluetooth headphones around. You’ll probably be able to go weeks of commuting between charges, even at relatively high volumes.They charge in half the time that the older model did, going from dead to fully charged in around three hours via the microUSB socket in the right earcup.The Marshall Major III Bluetooth only come in black and cost £129, which puts them in the mid-range of Bluetooth headphones. Competitors range from around £50 and up. The previous generation Major II Bluetooth are still on sale for £69, while a wired-only version of the Major III cost £69 and the Marshall Mid Bluetooth cost £169.The Marshall Major III Bluetooth are another brilliant pair of wireless on-ear headphones from the British audio brand that bring great sound, very long battery life and classic styling.They aren’t perfect, squeezing my head a little too hard, lacking NFC for instant pairing and with the cost of Bluetooth headphones coming down over the last couple of years they’re not quite as good value as they were in 2016.But the Major III Bluetooth are packed with small improvements over almost every aspect of the design, fit and sound compared to the previous generation, and worth considering, particularly if you’re into driving rock music.Pros: great sound, long battery life, great controls, fold up for travel, sturdy, great look, good connectivityCons: on-ear design may not be comfortable for everyone, no NFC for one-touch pairing"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fafbed2da0a9e10b27586cf3b7d57f425e57361d/0_118_6070_3642/master/6070.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8abd6d9320440e95eb4714d8d40949d2","title":"how back up holiday photos without using laptop cloud wifi","story":"Graham and his wife take thousands of photos while travelling but aren’t always near wifi – is there a cloudless alternative?We take thousands of photos on our caravan holidays, and I like to back them up every day or so. At present, I take a laptop and an external hard drive, so I have a copy on the laptop in the caravan plus a copy on the hard drive in my car.Is there a way to make backups from SD cards to hard drives without carrying a laptop? I should add that many of the caravan sites we visit do not have wifi, so cloud backup is not practicable. GrahamBacking up photos used to be a problem for people taking exotic holidays. I thought it had gone away, thanks to advances in technology.First, SD storage cards have got bigger and faster. Unless you are a professional sports photographer shooting sequences of RAW images, it takes a long time to fill affordable 64GB or 128GB SD cards, or even larger cards. You can easily carry 1TB without even noticing. (Video photographers may still have problems.)Second, laptops have become smaller and lighter over the past decade, and they generally have much better battery life. It wasn’t fun backpacking a 2.5kg laptop plus charger, but 1kg alternatives have been around for at least a decade. And since you have a caravan, I wouldn’t have thought the weight mattered.In my case, the 11.6in laptop is much lighter than the DSLR, extra-wide zoom, prime lens and flashgun. If you’re using a compact camera with a vintage laptop, things might be different. However, you could always buy a mini-laptop with a 7in screen, such as the GamePad GPD Pocket, GPD Pocket or Mini PC.Third, wireless connections are now widely available. I cede to your superior knowledge of caravan sites, but I expect you pass through small towns that have free wifi. Even if it’s too slow to do complete backups, you could always upload copies of your top three photos of the day.You could also use a 3G or 4G wireless connection to upload photos. This can be worth it to pro photographers who buy data-only sim cards for the purpose, but it’s an expensive way to back up holiday snaps.In general, I think the best solution is to buy lots of large SD or microSD cards and carry a small laptop. This is what I do. However, not all old equipment can handle large cards. Check the manuals or search online to find out how big an SD card your camera can handle, and whether your laptop can read it. If it can’t, a little USB adapter will probably solve the problem: I use an Anker adaptor that can work with two cards – one microSD and one SD – at the same time.When SD cards appeared, they used Microsoft’s FAT12 or FAT16 file system, so they could only store up to 2GB of data. However, SDHC cards, which use FAT32, can store up to 32GB, while SDXC cards can store up to 2TB using exFAT. With storage capacities above 16GB – typically 32GB, 64GB and 128GB – it’s rarely worth the effort of deleting photos. Just stick a new card in when the old one is full, and reformat it later if really necessary.If camera capacity is the bottleneck, you could back up your camera’s small SD cards to large SDXC cards, or microSD cards.SD cards are not impervious to damage: I have one that no longer works after getting crushed in my wallet. However, they’re probably safer than external hard drives, especially the ones not designed for travelling. SD cards don’t break when you drop them.People have been looking for a ways to back up CompactFlash and SD cards for many years, but I didn’t notice any making an impact on the consumer market. That changed with the Gnarbox, which raised over $500,000 on Kickstarter in 2015. The company now has three products, and the Gnarbox 2.0 SSD is on the way. It’s on track to raise more than $1 million on Kickstarter, and will ship to the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, among other places. Pre-launch prices range from $299 (128GB) to $699 (1TB).The Gnarbox is actually a very small computer with its own processor and memory. The clever bit is that it’s controlled from a smartphone app, so you get some of the benefits of a laptop without the size, weight or screen.Of course, the need for a processor and memory pushes up the price. A 128GB Gnarbox costs £329.99 at Amazon while 256GB jumps to £449.99. By contrast, you can buy a 256GB SD card for £78.46.The Gnarbox can solve the storage problem for members of the GoPro-using, drone-flying, smartphone-addicted post-laptop generation. But you can buy devices that do more for less.Several companies have launched external hard drives (EHDs) with SD card slots. Some of them also have wireless connectivity. Unfortunately, I haven’t tried any, so I can’t comment on their performance or their usability. However, the need for extra software and electronics is bound to push up the cost of storage, compared to bare drives, and you’ll still have to sacrifice other features you’d get by using a laptop instead.Sanho targets serious amateur and professional photographers with portable backup devices that include a small screen. The HyperDrive Colorspace UDMA3, for example, includes a 160GB hard drive – user-replaceable up to 2TB – and a 3.5in 320 x 480-pixel screen for £379.90. It supports USB3, and a built-in USB-2.0 OTG host enables it to connect directly to some cameras and camcorders. (OTG stands for “on the go”.) Built-in wifi allows connections to smartphones via iOS and Android apps, and to laptops via browsers. Plug it in to your PC’s USB port and it appears as a normal external hard drive.One cheaper alternative is Western Digital’s My Passport Wireless Pro: an external USB3 hard drive with an SD card slot and built-in wifi. WD claims it does “one-touch SD card copy”. It also has a USB2 port that can connect to cameras and other devices (I assume via OTG), and it can create a local hotspot that can support up to eight devices.US prices on WD’s website range from $149.99 for 1TB of storage to $219.99 for 4TB. On Amazon, the 4TB version is the best value: £203.39 at the time of writing. The 1TB model costs £162.10. (US prices don’t include sales taxes UK prices include VAT.)However, the My Passport Wireless Pro has as many one star reviews as five star reviews, and the bad reviews would certainly put me off. As one reviewer says: “Good concept. Implementation less than perfect.”Based on reading a mind-numbing volume of Amazon reviews for numerous products, I think your best bet is Sunvalley’s RAVPower FileHub Plus, which is dead cheap at £39.99. It is not a storage device. It is a wireless travel router, a DLNA-compatible media streamer, and a 6000mAh external battery pack that will recharge your smartphone. All these features could be useful to a caravan family.It also includes an SD card reader, so you could use it to copy an SD card from your camera to your current external hard drive, or other device, without using your laptop. Of course, you will need the smartphone app to run the operation.Have you got a question?

To this day, Wan Chai is a dense assemblage of residential flats, small stores, hole-in-the-wall restaurants and the occasional bar, crammed into just a few streets. We start at Wan Chai’s far western end, by Star Street – an area that’s home to some of the city’s hippest boutiques and eateries. Grab an energising coffee at Elephant Grounds at the entrance to the area, before heading up the hill to explore. Make sure to pop by design store Kapok, which stocks work from some of Hong Kong’s best designers, before swinging by combination art gallery and print shop Odd One Out. Also seek out Lala Curio, hidden away down an alleyway off the main streets. It’s crammed full of whimsical, Chinoiserie-inspired decor, furniture and accessories.We’re heading down the hill and into Wan Chai proper now, turning on to Queen’s Road East: the city’s first ever road, which still snakes along a good portion of the island. The Happy Cake Shop (106 Queen’s Road East) has been baking Hong Kong’s unique buns and cakes since 1979 and there’s always a reassuring queue out the door. Trays of baked goods are regularly brought out from the back, and you’ll want to grab whatever’s piping hot: go for a coconut-filled cocktail bun or a sugar-crusted pineapple bun, which actually contains no pineapple at all. And of course, you can never go wrong with a classic egg custard tart.Further down Queen’s Road, we get to the Hopewell Centre – one of the city’s very first skyscrapers. This cylindrical building contains Hong Kong’s only revolving restaurant, The Grand Buffet but you’re not here for the food: you’re here for the glass observation lift that propels visitors up to the 56th floor. As you ascend, the dense city falls away from you and the harbour pops into view beyond. We follow Queen’s Road again until we arrive at Stone Nullah Lane. A “nullah” is an open storm drain, an Indian word borrowed during colonial times. Thankfully, the nullah has since been covered over, although the name remains. Sitting on the lane is one of the city’s best-preserved pre-war buildings: the Blue House (72 Stone Nullah Lane), so-named for its vibrant hue. This balconied tenement appears just as it would have done when it was built in the 1920s, thanks to restoration efforts that have won it Unesco plaudits. The building was once home to a respected kung fu studio, and the ground floor was occupied by a bone-setting clinic – the traditional Chinese practice that’s a combination of chiropractic and martial arts. Now, the Hong Kong House of Stories on the ground floor hosts small-scale exhibitions. At the top of Stone Nullah Lane, the beautiful Pak Tai Temple sits ensconced in the shade of two enormous banyan trees. It’s the largest temple complex on Hong Kong Island, hidden away among auto repair shops and residential units. Pak Tai is a martial god, responsible for the triumph of good over evil. The temple was built in 1863 but is actually home to a copper statue of the deity that’s more than 250 years older. Make sure to check out the buildings to the side, where some of the temple’s original tiling is preserved.By now you’ll be in need of a restoring drink, and Tai Lung Fung (5-9 Hing Wan Street) has just the thing. This unpretentious bar is steeped in Hong Kong culture, from the distinctly Hong Kong tiling to the old-school memorabilia on the walls – all just the right side of kitsch. Suitably refreshed, we’re heading into the open-air market on Wan Chai Road. The “wet market” – so named for the water spritzed on the vegetables, and the stalls that are hosed down every day – offers a true snapshot of Hong Kong life. Market-goers haggle over the price of bok choy, butchers carve off chunks of pork belly, and chickens are killed and plucked for the freshest possible meal. In among it all are dotted dried seafood stores, eateries and bric-a-brac boutiques.Time for a classic bite in a cha chaan teng. These no-frills eateries – literally “tea restaurants”– grew up around Hong Kong’s industrial boom in the 50s and 60s, serving uniquely Hong Kong cuisine. The 61-year-old Ho Wah Cafe still serves up all the old favourites. Order the house speciality: a toasted corned beef and egg sandwich, washed down with strong, sweet milk tea. Next door to Ho Wah sits the Green House, named for its one-time paint job. This group of 10 prewar tenement buildings has been refurbished (and painted white), reconfigured around a small open square into Comix Home Base, an arts centre for Hong Kong’s comics industry. The space holds regular exhibitions, so there’s always something new to see.Reward your wanderings with a superbly crafted cocktail at The Optimist (239 Hennessy Road), one of the city’s best restaurants. Or if you’re in need of a view, then head across the road to Wooloomooloo Steakhouse, whose rooftop bar offers gob-smacking views of the city from right in the middle of it all. Look over the edge and the roads seem to stretch away far beyond you, orange-lit arteries glowing and blinking as dusk falls on Hong Kong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/954bca152f76e38fbada28c44191871dd50b67be/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e49693326139367375beb4c078ef9de","title":"immigration republicans congress dreamers daca","story":"House leadership scramble to satisfy a ided party ahead of a key meeting, as midterm elections loomThe fates of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants hang in the balance as lawmakers once again rush to accomplish in hours what has eluded Congress for decades: a way forward on immigration.A bloc of moderate House Republicans are challenging far-right conservatives – and their leadership – in the latest effort to secure protections for Dreamers, the nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants protected from deportation under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program that Donald Trump terminated. Their rebellion has set the stage for a dramatic showdown over a politically perilous issue that has riven the Republican party – and, some worry, could cost them their majority control in this year’s midterms. House Republican leaders have scheduled a private, two-hour conference to discuss the issue on Thursday morning. Their goal is to find common ground where there has long been none and, in doing so, prevent moderates from forcing a series of immigration votes over the objections of leadership.The centrists leading the fight – typically reliable partners of Republican leadership – say they have grown frustrated by years of inaction on immigration. Now, as many of them face competitive re-elections in districts with Hiic constituencies, they are demanding action on immigration reform.On the other side are the hardliners who have for years refused to compromise on immigration proposals. They worry that passing legislation to protect Dreamers, which some deride as “amnesty”, risks demoralizing conservative voters who zealously support Trump’s “zero tolerance” approach to immigration months before the midterm elections.Somewhere in the middle, at risk of being bypassed by both factions, stands Paul Ryan, the outgoing speaker of the House trying to hold the party together as his power drains away.“Our members are earnest and sincere in trying to understand each other’s perspectives,” Ryan told reporters on Wednesday. “I really do believe that there’s a sweet spot here.”But on the eve of Thursday’s meeting, members involved in negotiating a compromise plan left the speaker’s lobby without striking a deal. “We’re taking steps forward, not backwards,” Mark Meadows, the chairman of the arch-conservative House freedom caucus, told reporters after the meeting on Wednesday. “Hopefully what we’ll see is the objections get smaller and less of a hurdle in the hours to come. We’re down to hours – not weeks.”Should Republicans fail to reach a consensus, moderates have vowed to move ahead with a rarely used parliamentary procedure known as a “discharge petition”. The legislative maneuver would compel the House to take up four immigration bills. As of Wednesday, the petition remained just three signatures shy of the 218 needed to get a simple majority and propel the process to the floor.“We are as close as we’ve ever been” to a deal on an immigration bill, Carlos Curbelo, the Florida Republican leading the centrists’ effort, told reporters after a round of negotiations on Wednesday. But, he said, the moderate coalition would continue to seek the remaining signatures for a discharge petition should their discussions falter on Thursday.Nearly two dozen Republicans have signed the petition. And all Democrats have offered their signatures except for Henry Cuellar of Texas, who remains concerned that the process will pave the way for the construction of a border wall, which he opposes.A clash over immigration has loomed over Congress for months, since Trump ended the Daca program last September. The president implored lawmakers to find a solution and provided them with a framework that is unpalatable to Democrats and moderate Republicans. In exchange for protecting Dreamers, Trump has demanded funding for a border wall and new restriction to legal immigration.An attempt to address the issuefoundered in the Senate, when the chamber rejected four immigration proposals in February. The plan that met Trump’s immigration framework received the least support.Courts have ordered the administration to temporarily restart the program while they consider legal challenges to the president’s action. How to address the legal status of immigrants has emerged as a key sticking point in the negotiations, members said. Moderates have advocated for a “pathway to citizenship” for the young immigrants who meet certain criteria while members of the far-right freedom caucus have long derided the concession as “amnesty”.Even if the House overcomes the myriad of stumbling blocks to pass immigration legislation, the path forward would largely depend on the president’s response. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has said he would only bring up an immigration bill if Trump would sign it.Tom Cole, a Republican congressman from Oklahoma, worries that forcing a series of votes on immigration could result in the House narrowly passing a bill supported largely by Democrats that is too generous to satisfy Trump’s demands.“It’s not going to do us any good in the end to pass out of here something with a minority of Republicans that is certain to not get through the Senate, and if it did, to be vetoed by the president,” Cole said. “It might help some inidual members but it’s not going to help the Republican team.”Several House Republicans said they were waiting to see what happens during the meeting – described as a “family discussion” – before deciding whether they could sign on to any specific immigration proposal.Yet Cole remains optimistic that after years of deadlock, a solution is within reach. “When you put people together who are on the same team, more times than not they’ll find a way forward,” Cole said. “Now maybe they can’t. A lot will depend on what happens in that meeting.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f995dff4096536dd2afcad57b351b7dc94fa009/0_199_5706_3424/master/5706.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95fb779e517f671a1f15746ca0a0ef27","title":"nicaragua daniel ortega masaya","story":"Daniel Ortega makes yearly pilgrimages to Masaya. But in the cradle of Sandinismo, residents demand his exitThe graffiti that covers signs and billboards on the road to the cradle of Sandinismo offer once unimaginable snubs to the movement’s most celebrated comandante: ‘Despot!’ ‘Murderer!’ ‘Get out Daniel!’ ‘Ortega you are dead!’Masked rebels with homemade mortars guard more than a dozen roadblocks that now separate Nicaragua’s capital from Masaya, a storied revolutionary stronghold just 26km (16 miles) south, from which guerrillas launched their final assault on the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza in 1979.Almost four decades on from that momentous triumph, and with Nicaragua seemingly in the midst of another epochal upheaval, Masaya now has Daniel Ortega in its crosshairs.“He’s been attacking the people, killing the people. Now the people want him out,” said one 20-year-old mutineer with a black mortar slung over his shoulder as he escorted the  into the heart of the former Sandinista hotbed – now under almost total rebel control. Masaya has long been a bastion of Sandinista rebellion and rule. Nicaragua’s septuagenarian president makes annual pilgrimages to the intensely symbolic town, where his brother, Camilo, died battling Somoza’s troops in 1978. Today, Masaya is once again in full revolt – this time against the Sandinistas themselves.“Daniel must go,” insisted Rosa Caballero, a 48-year-old hotel manager who said she supported the uprising even though the eruption of violence had paralyzed the town and scared away all her guests.“I don’t think there is any way out,” the mother-of-three added. “All this repression. This whole struggle. It cannot be in vain ... I hope other cities join us so it is total pressure against the government.” Unrest began to grip Masaya on 19 April after protests broke out in the capital in response to planned social security reforms – then swelled into a broader, nationwide insurrection against what many call Ortega’s increasingly authoritarian and corrupt rule.But in recent days the violence – which has so far claimed almost 130 lives across the country – has escalated dramatically. At least 10 people were shot dead here over the weekend, allegedly by police and paramilitary gangs operating at the government’s behest. “It was a bloodbath,” La Prensa, an opposition newspaper that has been documenting the carnage, reported of what it called two nights of terror. “Day and night, Masaya seems a city at war.”In the wake of those killings, Masaya’s streets are tense and entirely devoid of any government presence. Dozens of barricades, cobbled together with tree trunks, concrete paving stones, metal signs and nail-studded planks, block the path into the heart of what was once a bustling tourist town famed for its artisan market. Mortar-wielding combatientes stop, question and search passersby. Stencil artists have set upon homes and businesses with spray cans to pour more scorn on their president. “Go to hell Daniel, you murderer,” is one recurring motif. Meanwhile, perhaps 50 police officers are said to be pinned down inside a local station.“We have no more law,” said Father Edwin Román, a local priest whose church, San Miguel, has found itself at the eye of this rapidly intensifying storm.Before the uprising, Father Román’s picturesque white church was a simple 40-minute drive from Managua. To reach it now, visitors must now sprint down a kind of sniper alley, down which demonstrators and church members claim security forces have been firing at demonstrators and civilians. “Be careful,” one masked rebel warned as he prepared to make a dash for cover. “They don’t care what nationality you are. They’ll shoot you right here,” he added, pointing to his forehead with his right hand and then using it again to suggest the resultant exit wound on the back of his skull. The conflict has transformed Román’s parish home into an unofficial field hospital. A statue of the Virgin Mary keeps watch over an improvised two-bed emergency room located next to what was once his sitting room. A volunteer force of medical students, paramedics and rescue workers camp out on its tiled floor, waiting for their next call. “It’s a war zone,” said a 27-year-old fireman who is part of a team of “blue helmet” rescue workers responsible for collecting the dead and wounded from the streets and dragging them away for treatment or burial. Like many local residents, the fireman said he backed the protests: “It’s the only way of making the government hear our voice.”Nicaragua’s state-controlled media has blamed the mounting body count vaguely on “delinquents” and “criminal groups”. The foreign minister, Denis Moncada, recently alleged a rightwing “conspiracy” was under way designed to destroy Nicaragua’s international image and allow organised criminals to seize control.As he prepared for his latest day on the front line, Father Román dismissed the idea that those now controlling Masaya’s streets were “vandals”. “All walks of life – kids, young people, entire families – are supporting this,” he said. “I think it’s impossible for things to go back to the way things were before.”With no solution in sight, Father Román said he sought solace in the book of Isaiah. “He will swallow up death forever and the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the Lord has spoken,” he said, before adding: “This is the situation that we are going through. Nicaragua is crying. The mothers are crying ... I too have cried.”“I consider this to be like birth pangs. There is blood the blood of the young people, the tears of the mothers. But it will not be in vain,” the priest insisted. “It will be the fertilizer for freedom.”Additional reporting by Juan Diego Briceño"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1461f6c50b67bd71c1141ec23589b64b22ef5c68/0_218_4682_2810/master/4682.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=190b62cb8a9dac5dc58041af3857968d","title":"all eyes on ramzan kadyrov as chechnya hosts egypt in world cup","story":"Chechen leader is step closer to political goal of being Putin’s link to Middle East with arrival of Egyptian teamThe Tunisians were first to visit, followed by the Iranians, and then the Saudis. But it was the Egyptians, led by the Liverpool superstar Mohamed Salah, who snatched up the dubious grand prize: a World Cup training base in Chechnya. Once devastated by civil war, Chechnya is now the focus of intense international scrutiny over its crackdown on political opponents and gay people in this region in Russia’s North Caucasus. But the controversy did not stop delegations from the Middle East from lining up to tour the stadium that the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov built and named after his father, the same pitch where he once reviewed more than 20,000 camouflaged soldiers likened to his personal guard. For Kadyrov, who has spent a decade building a pervasive cult of personality at home, playing host to a national side in this year’s World Cup is a step toward his foreign policy ambitions: carving out a niche as Vladimir Putin’s envoy to the Middle East and the de facto voice of Russian Muslims abroad.“We all know that our leader has a good relationship with Saudi kings, with princes, with the leadership of Egypt. We are happy Egypt has made the choice to come to us,” said Magomed Matsuev, the stadium’s director, sitting in his office under a portrait of Kadyrov and his father, Akhmad.Matsuev once hoped to see Grozny named a World Cup host city, and in 2012 went so far as to bring down executives from the British architects KSS and engineers Mott MacDonald to consider a stadium expansion. But politics got in the way, he says, and Grozny was passed over.Now, hosting a national team with a megastar like Salah, a world-famous Muslim footballer who celebrates each goal in a display of faith, has provided some consolation.“Through football, we are going to show that we are developing, not going backward like the press says, trying to reignite old hatreds through disinformation,” Matsuev said.Not far from the polished downtown, the Egyptian team, which arrives on Sunday, will be staying at a new luxury hotel built with investment from Dubai. Egyptian players will break the Ramadan fast with halal cuisine in a region where Kadyrov has made alcohol scarce, a pocket of Islamic worship in a country better known for a tradition of Orthodoxy or atheism.This is the Chechnya built by Kadyrov, a 41-year-old gym fanatic who has become one of Russia’s most effective, and brutal, politicians. The former rebel turned satrap was given carte blanche to quell the region’s simmering Islamic insurgency after his father, the former president, was assassinated in a bomb blast in 2004. Kadyrov has wielded faith as a tool to remake Chechnya, empowering loyal religious leaders and a local Sufi-infused Islam to cement his control. His religious fervour has sometimes veered into the bizarre: In 2015, he claimed to have received a blood transfusion from a descendant of the prophet Muhammad and said it had made him “the happiest man on earth”.“Islam has been a brilliant tool for Ramzan Kadyrov,” said Grigory Shvedov, the editor of Caucasian Knot, one of the few independent news agencies focusing on Russia’s North Caucasus region. By using his faith, “he can sometimes do more than laws in Russia may allow and remain legitimate in the eyes of his population”.With his power secure at home, Kadyrov has increasingly staked out a position as a defender of the faith outside of Chechnya. In Russia, Kadyrov has organised public protests against cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in Charlie Hebdo and the persecution of Muslims in Myanmar. He has sent military police to Syria and taken in the wives and children of Islamic State fighters returning from Syria.To some degree, Kadyrov has set out to fulfill his father’s prophecy that Chechnya would become “the link tying Russia to Saudi Arabia”.For the Kremlin, Kadyrov is an important envoy to repair decades of bad blood with the Gulf, a region that has traditionally kept close ties with Washington and seen relations further fray with Moscow during the conflict in Syria. One Russian diplomat compared Kadyrov’s role to an “advance man”, noting that his meetings were a way for the Kremlin to establish contact without holding formal talks.When Saudi Arabia’s King Salman visited the Kremlin in 2017 for a state visit, the first by a Saudi monarch, Kadyrov was there.Kadyrov “is very much needed as a person in the Middle East who can show that there is a country that won’t listen to Washington and won’t be scared by sanctions”, said Shvedov.There have been missteps as Kadyrov has attempted to establish religious authority. A 2016 conference of religious scholars in Chechnya ended in controversy after a fatwa was issued condemning Salafism, a branch of Sunni Islam widespread in Saudi Arabia. Media outlets in Saudi Arabia and the UAE later reported that Kadyrov travelled to Saudi Arabia to apologise in person to the crown prince, although Chechen officials deny that.Observers of Chechnya note that while Kadyrov’s interests often dovetail with the Kremlin’s, a leading motivation is to ensure continuing streams of funding to Grozny. “Kadyrov understands he is needed and he shows that he needs to be paid,” said Shvedov, noting Kadyrov’s aggressive lobbying from Moscow on behalf of the region’s budget. “And when he is not properly paid inside of the country, he might pursue his own deals and interests.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f3df8a59aade9939ce3407ba6e185946db2e1e8/0_77_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=968a200ea4d7402ba907b08929662848","title":"argentina museum egomaniacs imf marcos pena","story":"Cabinet chief Marcos Peña warns against lure of populism during visit to London as government faces economic headwindsArgentina “is a museum of egomaniacs who said they were saviours of the country and failed one by one” the country’s cabinet chief said on a visit to London, as he insisted that his government’s appeal to the IMF to fend off a currency crisis will not affect the country’s growth.Marcos Peña said the centre-right government of Mauricio Macri will reach a deal with the IMF that will accelerate existing plans to cut the fiscal deficit next year.But Macri is facing growing discontent at home after failing to deliver on his campaign promise to kickstart the economy with massive foreign investments, and observers wonder if his administration might not eventually end up on Argentina’s roll call of failed saviours.Macri’s government has been praised internationally for its efforts to stabilise Argentina’s economy but has faced widespread protests at home over its austerity policies.Meanwhile, huge home utility hikes are wearing the patience of Argentina’s middle class thin and have made a mockery of his campaign promise of “zero poverty”.Market turbulence across a range of emerging economies was largely prompted by investors’ flight to the dollar in anticipation of high US interest rates.Peña said the shock underlined the degree to which the Argentinian economy is exposed to external events. He said: “That exposure is a rule for everyone today, but we are very conscious of vulnerability to external events. We are living in an accelerated time of globalisation. We think it is going to be exponential in the next decades, but we are positive about that. “No one can guarantee stability at a time of such deep change. As a country we have a PhD in volatility. We have now got to get a PhD in institution building and relying on our own strengths.”Although the IMF is deeply unpopular in Argentina – where it played a central role in the 2001 financial collapse after insisting on harsh austerity measures – Peña said the current return to the Fund was not comparable since “there is a synchronisation” about how to address Argentina’s problems – including the need to cut the fiscal deficit faster than planned next year.Peña said that any bailout package will be compatible with growth and poverty reduction targets.He said: “We do not intend for one second to blame our problems on the IMF or anyone else, if what is proposed is good for our economy.”But he denied the turn to the IMF was unpopular, saying only an ideological minority opposed what was a preventive measure.Neverthless observers now forecast tougher than expected elections in October next year. Large anti-IMF protests in Buenos Aires last month, and political resistance to cuts in energy subsidies, could be harbingers of future trouble.But Peña said one of Macri’s main tasks was to normalise a country after too much turbulence and volatility, claiming that the administration was putting an end to a culture of power that depended on saviour figures and populism.Peña was in London to meet British cabinet ministers, evaluate the chances of a bilateral Mercosur-UK trade deal after Brexit, and set out Argentina’s agenda for the G20 summit in Buenos Aires in November.Peña, who also laid a wreath in honour of all the soldiers who fell in the Falklands conflict, said that differences over the islands need not sour relations and trade between the two countries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7fc09921ee388e23f8ecd15928a32311a44e0eb/0_251_4147_2488/master/4147.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b0ffe800e0a173eb0aa99df4d706555","title":"fresh free and beautiful the rise of urban gardening","story":"How an urban farms project in Dallas and a fellowship garden in Connecticut are helping their communitiesby  Rachel Obordo and   readersHow an urban farms project in Dallas and a fellowship garden in Connecticut are helping their communitiesby  Rachel Obordo and   readersIn Dallas, Texas, in an area designated as a food desert, meaning access to fresh fruit and vegetables is difficult, Big Tex urban farms have donated 85,000 servings of fruit and vegetables to the community since 2016.Developed for and funded by the annual Texas state fair, the project consists of mobile beds in car parks and a hydroponic greenhouse which allow plants to grow without soil. “The majority of the population in this area relies on small corner stores that do not provide access to quality produce or healthy foods,” said Jason Hays, the fair’s creative director. “Access to modern grocery stores can be inhibited due to pricing, transportation and education. The city tried to lure a large grocer with financial incentives but had no luck. “Access to fresh food options can have a profound effect on the health and wellbeing of iniduals, which can transform communities. I believe everyone should have equal access to healthy options as well as education to improve eating habits.”One recipient, Glenda Cunningham, of the Baylor Scott and White health and wellness centre, praised the project’s work. “The community looks forward to the Big Tex urban farm delivery each week. The food is fresh, free and beautiful,” she said.In Orange, Connecticut, the food production company Watson’s fellowship garden has been running for four years. The company grows produce for food banks and had extra space available, so it decided to expand and has opened its garden to a centre helping children with autism spectrum issues. Christina Cole, 47, a graphic designer at Watson, said: “The plot for Milestones Behavioural Services, which includes a pumpkin and melon patch, gives kids with autism and developmental disabilities the chance to not only have fun and be outside, but also learn life skills and take home what they grow and learn to cook with their families. With the garden season kicking in, we’re getting ready to put in a corn maze.”According to the Connecticut food bank, one in eight people in the state struggle with hunger. “We feel no one should have to think about where their next meal is coming from,” Cole said.The company provides 4,800 plants each year, and those not used are donated to the food bank for use in its gardens. Watson hopes the garden will not only help children but also address food insecurity facing older generations. “Those who are elderly and on a low income used to get vouchers from the state to access fresh fruit and vegetables, but the programme has been cut due to a lack of funding. With our garden we hope to work with the community and help with such issues. Everyone should have access to food, much less something fresh,” Cole said.She said shops were willing to donate food in West Haven but did not have the resources to do so. “I’m in the process of trying to organise the logistics of starting runners to help businesses get food to those who need it most. We’re hoping it will help reduce food waste in the area.” Rose Majestic, the executive director of Wheat, which provides food to people in crisis, said: “The people who comes to us can’t afford fresh produce so Watson’s weekly deliveries go a long way in helping them. We hope other businesses that have yards that can be dug up and used for feeding the hungry in our community start to do the same.”Watson is hosting an event in June to try to get local businesses to start their own community food-growing projects. “In light of the world nowadays, we should all get back to learning to grow our own food. It is the essential basis for survival. It can only further us all to know how to feed ourselves healthily and it’s a great help to have an alternative food source for our neighbours.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Approval ratings for their main rival, the current Liberal premier, Kathleen Wynne, had tumbled to the lowest in Canada as residents grappled with rising inequality, stagnating incomes and economic uncertainty. Months before the election, the Conservatives found themselves in turmoil after their leader, Patrick Brown, accused of sexual misconduct, resigned. Doug Ford, the brother of Rob, threw his hat in the ring, surprising many when he emerged victorious as Ontario’s new Conservative leader.A businessman who rails against the elite and regularly peppers his speeches and interviews with boasts and falsehoods, Ford soon began drawing comparisons to Donald Trump, prompting questions as to whether the isive wedge politics that have swept countries around the world had landed in Canada. Ford came with the baggage of being his brother’s most aggressive defender, lashing out at Toronto police and journalists as Rob fended off allegations of smoking crack.Doug was also plagued by his own set of drug-related allegations in 2013, the Globe and Mail reported that he had sold hashish for several years in the 1980s. Ford has denied the claims. Pointing to the multimillion-dollar label company he had inherited from his father, he touted his business acumen and vowed to erect a neon sign at the US border reading “Ontario is open for business”.But the Conservatives’ commanding lead eroded as Ford refused to detail how his promises would be funded – simply saying he would find “efficiencies” across the government – and amid calculations that suggest his tax cuts would disproportionately benefit the province’s wealthiest.His advisers – many of whom worked for the former prime minister Stephen Harper – responded by clamping down on media access to Ford, limiting questions at press conferences and denying most interview requests.Polls suggested that some voters turned away, instead looking to the New Democrats, led by Andrea Horwath, and their pledges to drastically expand universal healthcare, reduce childcare costs and replace student loans with grants. Just days before the vote, Ford family drama roared into the headlines, as the widow and children of Rob Ford filed a C$16.5m ($12.3m) lawsuit in a Toronto court. Rob, who served as Toronto’s mayor from 2010 to 2014, died in March 2016 after a battle with cancer. The lawsuit accused Doug Ford of being a “negligent” business manager whose decisions had steadily chipped away at the value of the company the Ford brothers had inherited from their father, Deco labels. Along with alleging losses of C$5m in the past seven years, the lawsuit claims that Doug, along with his other brother, Randy, does not have “the education and business ability to justify their employment as senior officers of Deco”, noting that the two also “failed” to retain competent management or appropriate business advisers to assist them. The allegations have not been proven in court. “Those claims are false and without merit,” Ford told reporters on Tuesday. “And it will be very clear when we prove that in court.” His political opponents jumped on the lawsuit. “Doug Ford has promised to run the province like a business,” the NDP noted in a statement. “But if he can’t run his own business properly, how can he be trusted to run the province?” Wynne, the Liberal leader, described the lawsuit as distressing. “It’s distressing because this is the kind of thing we will get daily from Doug Ford as premier. Chaos and confusion. It’s not what Ontario needs,” she wrote on social media.

But there are real reasons to be concerned. The quality of teaching is under strain in Irish third level. Over the past decade, student numbers in many colleges have risen by more than 20 per cent.However, staff numbers have remained static due to Government-imposed recruitment restrictions. This has led to overcrowded classes, reduced access to practicals and less support for inidual students. This shows up in student-teacher ratios, a key metric used in international rankings. Take the case of UCD. A decade ago, the university ranked in the top-100 (86th place) for student-teacher ratios. Following employment restrictions and reduced State funding, it has plummeted to 536th place globally.Last year, UCD’s president warned that it may have to reduce Irish student numbers to tackle this problem. This could limit supply at a time when student numbers are rising, sending CAO points even higher still.It is clear, then, that either drastic measures or extra funding will be needed if we really are serious about – to quote the Government’s favourite phrase – creating the best education and training system in Europe. But it’s hard to see where funding will come from. Hard-pressed families and students are already paying the second-highest fees in Europe.The prospect of an income-contingent student loan scheme – which could allow for further increases – is off the agenda after the Government recently opted to kick this can down the road.The private sector, meanwhile, has grumbled over being forced to contribute extra to higher education through increases to the National Training Fund.This leaves the public sector. The Government says it has invested more than €100 million this year compared to 2016. The reality, however, is that this money is simply keeping most universities standing still.Funding per inidual student has nudged upwards only slightly because most extra money has gone to paying for public sector pay increases.If there is to be a surge in investment, it is hard to see where it will come from given competing demands on the public purse.One potential answer is to boost university autonomy and relax Government restrictions. Most universities now generate the bulk of their income privately. It is questionable whether the Government should wield such authority within a sector when it is becoming a minority investor.

File photograph: Getty ImagesIrish universities have tumbled down the latest set of influential world rankings, sparking alarm among senior academics over the funding “crisis” facing higher education.Trinity College Dublin has lost its status as Ireland’s only top-100 university, while six out of eight Irish top-ranked colleges have fallen down the rankings.Senior academics say Government-imposed caps on staffing, growing student numbers and a decade of under-investment are to blame.Universities such as UCD – which previously said it would consider capping the number of Irish students – are now considering new measures to tackle the rising student per lecturing staff ratio.The QS World University Rankings show Trinity fell from 88th to 104th in the world, while UCD slid from 168th to 193rd place.NUI Galway also fell (from 243rd place to 260th), as did UCC (from 283rd to 338th place).In the capital, DCU was down (from 391st place to 422nd) along with DIT – which is categorised as a university by the rankings body – (down from the 651-700 category to the 751-800 category).The only two Irish institutions which avoided dropping were the University of Limerick (which remained in the 501-550 category) and Maynooth University (which remained in the 701-750 category).Ranking experts say the Irish sector is facing a range of challenges, with declines on key measures such as staff-student ratios, academic reputation and employer reputation.QS said that even though Irish universities have increased their research output, they have been outpaced by other universities across the globe.All Irish universities also received lower ranks for the relatively low proportions of international students.The Irish Universities Association said it had serious concerns that a continued failure to address the third-level funding crisis will directly damage the Irish economy in future years.Director-general Jim Miley said: “It’s time to stop delaying a decision on a proper funding model for Irish third-level education. The Government know what needs to be done and should now bite the bullet.”Prof Andrew Deeks, UCD president, said a continuing deterioration in the student-staff ratio – which now stands at about 20 students per single faculty member – can no longer be endured.“At a time when countries like China are investing billions into their best universities to reduce their student-teacher ratio to 10:1 and to raise their world standing, the Irish Government perseveres with austerity-level funding of Irish higher education,” Prof Deeks said.“As a direct result, Irish parents continue to pay the highest up-front fees for undergraduate education in Europe, and the standing of the Irish university system continues to decline relative to more ambitious systems.”A spokeswoman for Minister for Education Richard Bruton, however, said the Government has invested an additional €100 million into higher education this year compared to 2016.  In addition, a levy on employers - known as the National Training Levy - is due to increase between now and 2020, generating additional revenue for the education and training sector.Globally, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was named the world’s leading university for the seventh consecutive year.It was followed by US universities Stanford, Harvard, and California Institute of Technology.University of Oxford (5th place) was the top-ranking UK institution, usurping its longtime rival, the University of Cambridge (6th).Overall, both the US and UK have seen their performances stabilise, with slightly more improvements than drops.In continental Europe, the best university remained ETH Zurich (7th place).Europe, in general, also stabilised its performance, with a fractionally higher number of rises than drops.In Asia, Nanyang Technological University ranked highest (12th), while Tsinghua University is the first Chinese top-20 university in the QS rankings in more than a decade.Malaysia is home to a top-100 university for the first time, after Universiti Malaya rose to 87th.   * This article was amended on 07062018 to correct an error relating to the position of UCC in the QS rankings."},{"url":null,"title":"magdalene woman we were slaves to the nuns and the church but no more","story":"  June 5, 2018First time for many to speak freely to other women incarcerated in the laundries   June 5, 2018When I first met her she doubted justice would ever come her way-not from the Good Shepherd Sisters and not from the Irish State   June 5, 2018President apologises at \u0026Aacuteras reception to women who worked in laundries   June 5, 2018Banquet held in Dublin\u0026rsquos Mansion House for some 230 people incarcerated in laundries "},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

File photograph: Eric LukeThe mapping of DNA from some of the settlers who colonised Iceland more than 1,000 years ago offers an insight into the fate of thousands of slaves – mostly women – who were taken by Norse Vikings from Ireland and Scotland before they put down roots on the North Atlantic island.Anthropologist Sunna Ebenesersdóttir, of the University of Iceland and the company deCODE Genetics in Reykjavik, analysed the genomes of 25 ancient Icelanders whose skeletal remains were found in burial sites across the island. Sequencing using samples from teeth revealed the settlers had a roughly even split of Norse (from what are today Norway and Sweden) and Gaelic ancestry. It is the first in-depth investigation of how a new population is formed through a genetic process known as “admixture”.When the researchers compared the ancient genomes to those of modern people in Iceland and other European countries, they found contemporary Icelanders, on average, draw about 70 per cent of their genes from Norse ancestry. This suggests that in the 1,100 years between settlement and today, the population underwent a surprisingly quick genetic shift in favour of Norse genes, the researchers report in the journal Science.They confirm that while the ancient settlers, “mainly Norse men and Gaelic women”, are genetically indistinguishable from present-day Irish, Scots and Scandinavians, present-day Icelanders have over the course of 1,000 years, and numerous population bottlenecks, become a distinct new population. “Repeated famines and epidemics led to a substantial loss of sequence ersity from the Icelandic gene pool, causing it to drift away from its source populations in Scandinavia and the British-Irish Isles,” explained Kári Stefánsson, deCODE chief executive and co-author on the paper. Another possibility, he suggested, is that ancient Icelanders with more Norse ancestry held a slight edge in reproductive success over those with Gaelic ancestry, many of whom were enslaved when they came to the island.The Celts were often buried in unmarked graves though, intriguingly, a minority were buried in the traditional Viking way, with their sword and boat.On the study, he added: “This is a fascinating example of how a population is shaped by its environment, in this case the harsh and marginal conditions of medieval Iceland. “It is also another demonstration of how our small but well characterised population can continue to make important contributions to understanding the fundamental genetic and evolutionary processes that shape our species.”Their next step is to expand sample size, and to examine how diseases affected the population.

There are a range of options for how a time limit could be delivered, which the UK will propose and discuss with the EU.”Earlier, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said Ireland cannot agree to a time-limited version of a post-Brexit backstop arrangement .“The principle that is in the existing backstop that is supported by the 27 EU member states is that it applies at least until there is an alternative in place,” Mr Varadkar told reporters before the British government published its proposals. “It is not something that can be just time-limited.“It has to be as they say ’all weather’, it has to be applicable until such a time if and when there is a new relationship between the EU and UK that prevents a hard border.”Meanwhile, British prime minister Theresa May held “constructive” talks with Mr Davis and expects him to remain in his role, Downing Street has said.Ms May also held separate face-to-face discussions in her parliamentary office with the two other leading Brexiteers, foreign secretary Boris Johnson and international trade secretary Liam Fox.The meeting with Mr Davis, running to more than 30 minutes, was the longest.None of the three ministers threatened to resign during the discussions, a spokeswoman for Ms May said.The isions on the backstop initiative emerged after Mr Davis was believed to be insisting the UK should be able to unilaterally withdraw from any border agreement in order to maintain leverage with Brussels in ongoing negotiations.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3521727.1528314489!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may can t please everyone with backstop balancing act","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May: the benches behind her were filled with row after row of despondent faces, Brexiteers and Remainers alike. Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeBloombergSix months after Theresa May agreed to a backstop arrangement to prevent a hard border, and three weeks ahead of a crucial EU summit, she is planning to publish her proposal for the backstop on Thursday. As so often during the Brexit negotiations, however, she must first clear the hurdle of her own ministers in a cabinet subcommittee amid snarling from Brexiteers on her own backbenches.Downing Street on Wednesday insisted that the backstop will be time-limited, a key Brexiteer demand, but the prime minister has promised Brussels that the backstop will remain in place “unless and until” another solution for the Border is found. These two commitments are clearly contradictory and Brexiteers fear – probably correctly – that the backstop will only end when the EU agrees that it should.The EU’s proposed language on the backstop earlier this year envisaged it as an arrangement specific to Northern Ireland, which would remain aligned with the customs union and parts of the single market until another agreed solution to keep the Border open is found. Britain’s proposal is expected to call for the backstop to be applied to the whole of the UK, so that no new regulatory barriers are erected between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.EU negotiators reject the idea of a UK-wide backstop on the grounds that it amounts to cherry-picking parts of the single market without accepting the full responsibilities of membership. This special arrangement, Brussels says, can be extended to Northern Ireland because of its special circumstances but will not be available to the whole of the UK.For their part, Brexiteers fear that, unless Britain can unilaterally place a time limit on the backstop, the country will remain indefinitely in the customs union and subject to EU single market rules it will have no part in shaping. They argue that, with Britain in the customs union and subject to EU regulations for goods, the EU will have little incentive to agree a comprehensive trade deal to cover services, where Britain enjoys a trade surplus with the EU.As she faces the possibility of defeat next week on amendments to the EU withdrawal Bill at the hands of Conservative Remainers, May has succeeded in disappointing her own backbenchers on both sides of the Brexit debate. At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, the benches behind her were filled with row after row of despondent faces, Brexiteers and Remainers united in their lack of enthusiasm for their leader.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"city highlights fromnational geographic travel photographer","story":"This is a selection of images from the National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year Contest which is open for entries until May 31, 2018.The Scenic Suitcase taken by Stephanie MillerThe colorful streets of Bo Kaap weren\u0027t always this way.

Destitution is defined as people lacking two “essential needs”, such as food or housing.The polling on food poverty, from\u0026nbspa representative sample of 1,050 UK adults carried out for The Independent by D-CYFOR,\u0026nbspsuggests that 7 per cent of the adult population – or 3.7 million people – have used a food bank to receive a meal.A million people\u0026nbsphave\u0026nbspdecreased the portion size of their child’s meal due to financial constraints, the survey says.The results come\u0026nbspafter it emerged in April that the number of emergency meals handed out at food banks had risen at a higher rate than ever, soaring by 13 per cent in a year, with more than 1.3 million three-day emergency food supplies given to people in crisis in the 12 months to March.The JRF report, carried out by Heriot-Watt University, found that among the tens of thousands of people who were recorded as being destitute last year, food was the most commonly lacked item, with 62 per cent within the group reporting that they had gone without over the past month.\u0026nbspNearly half (47 per cent) had lacked basic toiletries, with 46 per cent lacking suitable clothing and 42 per cent having to go without heating. One in five destitute people reported lacking lighting at home, and 16 per cent had recently slept rough.Margaret Greenwood, Labour’s shadow\u0026nbspwork and pensions secretary, said: “These figures are shocking. After eight years of Conservative austerity, we are seeing destitution reappearing on our streets.“Benefit delays and sanctions are among key reasons why people are forced into destitution. The sanctions rate in universal credit is well over 10 times higher than for jobseeker’s\u0026nbspallowance, yet the government is rapidly accelerating the roll out of universal credit with the risk that increasing numbers of people will be left with no alternative but to turn to food banks.”Garry Lemon, director of policy and research at the\u0026nbspTrussell\u0026nbspTrust, said: “These figures are deeply concerning, especially when we know that not everyone facing hunger or skipping meals goes to a food bank.\u0026nbsp“Last year our network alone provided 1.3 million supplies to people across the UK – this is just not right. If we’re to end hunger we need to go to the root of why people are struggling to stay above water, and ensure that adequate financial support is in place whenever its most needed.”The JRF report highlighted that a reduction in benefit sanctions between 2015 and 2017 saw levels of destitution decline by around 25 per cent over this period, but warned of a “real risk” that this would unravel as universal credit is embedded across the country, prompting another spike in sanctions.Benefit sanctions, which take the form of docking a portion of benefit payments for a period of time, can be imposed for breaching benefit conditions like not attending a work placement, or for being minutes late for a jobcentre appointment.They have been widely criticised in recent years after it emerged claimants had been docked hundreds of pounds and pitched into financial crisis for often trivial breaches of benefit conditions, or for administrative errors beyond their control.Recent government figures show that almost half (49 per cent) of all universal credit decisions resulted in a benefit sanction – up 12 percentage points from August 2017 to October 2017.\u0026nbspCampbell Robb, chief executive of JRF, said: “Many of us rely on public services such as social security when hit with unexpected circumstances like job loss, relationship breakdown or ill health.\u0026nbsp“Yet actions by government, local authorities and utility companies are leading to ‘destitution by design’: forcing people into a corner when they are penniless and have nowhere to turn. This is shameful.“Social security should be an anchor holding people steady against powerful currents such as rising costs, insecure housing and jobs, and low pay, but people are instead becoming destitute with no clear way out.”Mr Campbell said the reduction in benefit sanction rates had meant some headway has been made, but warned there was a “real risk” that once universal credit is embedded across the country, more people could again be at risk unless changes are made.A DWP spokesperson said: “Work is the best route out of poverty and our welfare reforms incentivise employment while having the right support in place for those that need it.\u0026nbspUniversal credit lies at the heart of our commitment to improve lives, and it is seeing people move into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system.\u0026nbsp“This report fails to take this into account, nor the recent improvements we have made to universal credit, including continuing to pay two weeks’ housing costs for claimants moving onto UC, removing the seven waiting days, increasing advance payments to 100 per cent per cent and extending repayment times to 12 months.“Since 2010, one million people have been lifted out of absolute poverty and employment is at a record high, with 1,000 people moving into work every day. Meanwhile, we continue to spend £90bn a year on welfare to support those who need it most.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Turkish police dispersing a march in Istanbul with tear gas and rubber bullets in 2015 and banning the event in 2016 and 2017 outright on security grounds underlines\u0026nbspthe ongoing relevance of the demonstration.More recent reports of homophobic violence being carried out in Chechnya\u0026nbsp and Indonesia\u0026nbspfurther emphasise the need for education to encourage greater tolerance.This year\u0027s London Pride parade is scheduled for Saturday 7 July while the UK\u0027s largest event\u0026nbsptakes place in Brighton on Saturday 4 August, coinciding with the Pride Festival held at Preston Park between 3 and 5 August, which is this year being headlined by the one and only\u0026nbspBritney Spears.Other key events taking place across Britain this summer include:In Europe, this summer\u0027s biggest Pride events are:Even further afield, you can celebrate Pride in these cities:or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The initial Downing Street draft of the document is understood not to have included the 2021 limit.The row centred over the\u0026nbspbackstop plan that would see the UK temporarily remain in parts of the EU customs union if no other way is found to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.The final paragraph\u0026nbspin the paper published on Thursday makes clear the government “expects” such an arrangement to be temporary, but includes\u0026nbspno clear commitment to this end.It states: “The UK is clear that the temporary customs arrangement, should it be needed, should be time limited, and that it will be only in place until the future customs arrangement can be introduced. The UK is clear that the future customs arrangement needs to deliver on the commitments made in relation to Northern Ireland.“The UK expects the future arrangement to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest. There are a range of options for how a time limit could be delivered, which the UK will propose and discuss with the EU.”The agreement was reached after Ms May held separate meetings in her Commons office with Mr Davis and other\u0026nbspBrexiteer ministers\u0026nbspBoris Johnson and Liam Fox\u0026nbspon Thursday morning. A Downing Street spokesperson said none of the ministers had threatened to resign during the meetings, which they described as “constructive”.A source close to Mr Davis said the document had been amended in order to add “much more detail” about the backstop time limit.They said: “Obviously, there’s been a back and forth on this paper, as there always is whenever the government publishes anything.“The\u0026nbspbackstop\u0026nbsppaper has been amended and now expresses, in much more detail, the time-limited nature of our proposal –\u0026nbspsomething the prime minister and David Davis have always been committed to.”While Ms May has staved off the threat of Mr Davis quitting, the compromise proposal will probably be swiftly shot down by the EU, which has insisted the backstop arrangement cannot be time limited.The final paper proposes that, if no other arrangement for the Northern Ireland border is agreed, there should be no “tariffs, quotas, rules of origin (or) customs processes” applied to UK-EU trade for as long as the backstop is in place.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Barnier said the plan would have to respect the integrity of the single market, and be a “workable solution” to the border of an “all-weather” character.But Guy Verhofstadt, who has taken the role as a vocal outrider for Brussels during Brexit negotiations, said on Thursday afternoon that the plan did not look workable.European Commission officials said they were studying the proposals.\u0026nbspAlso commenting shortly after the release of the latest plan,\u0026nbspMr Barnier said: “I welcome publication of UK proposal on customs aspects of IrelandNorthern Ireland backstop.”“We will examine it with three questions: is it a workable solution to avoid a hard border? Does it respect the integrity of the single market and customs union? Is it an all-weather backstop?”The Prime Minister emerged\u0026nbspfrom a Cabinet row today after Brexiteers demanded that the so-called “backstop”\u0026nbspplan for the Irish border be strictly time-limited. Brexit Secretary David Davis had reportedly threatened to resign over the issue:\u0026nbsphe and other Brexiteers\u0026nbspfear that plans to align the whole UK with the single market and customs union until another way of preventing a hard border was found\u0026nbspwould amount to keeping Britain tied to EU rules indefinitely.Mr Davis appears to have carried the day, as the proposals say that “the temporary customs arrangement, should it be needed, should be time limited, and that it will be only in place until the future customs arrangement can be introduced”. But the white paper is, again, light on detail, and says only that “there are a range of options for how a time limit could be delivered, which the UK will propose and discuss with the EU”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Hippos are susceptible to the infection, and can pass it to humans who eat infected meat.\u0026nbspZambia\u0026nbspinitially suspended a planned cull in 2016 following pressure from activists, but Born Free\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspaccused\u0026nbspthe government of “secretly” overturning the decision and “promoting the cull to trophy hunters”.\u0026nbspWill Travers, chief executive of\u0026nbspthe charity, told The Independent\u0026nbspthe authorities have failed to provide enough\u0026nbspevidence showing\u0026nbspan overpopulation of hippos in the Luangwa River, or to make public any data that\u0026nbspjustifies\u0026nbspthe cull.They are, apparently, using the same flawed rationale for the slaughter as last time – a preventative measure to avoid a future outbreak of anthrax, combined with an assertion that low rainfall will exacerbate the situation, he said.They also appear not to have informed key stakeholders in the Luangwa Valley...\u0026nbspThe negative consequences for thousands of hippo and Zambia’s reputation as a wildlife tourism destination cannot be underestimated.”Umlilo Safaris, a South African trophy hunting company, last month began\u0026nbspoffering customers\u0026nbspa five-day “hippo management hunt” in the Laungwa Valley for £10,500 each.\u0026nbspThe organisation’s Facebook page says hunters can shoot five hippos per trip and keep the animals\u0027 tusks.Richard Kock, professor of wildlife health\u0026nbspat the Royal Veterinary College, told The Independent the government needed to provide\u0026nbspdata to justify the cull.\u0026nbsp“There’s no doubt that hippos can build up numbers until there really are probably too many for the ecosystem,” he said. “And so I think the anthrax may well be a factor in controlling their populations, and it may benefit the environment because they will consume large quantities of herbage, and obviously that will affect other species.\u0026nbsp“I’m also very sensitive to the fact people use these things as excuses for nefarious behaviour. So I would say you need good data and you need good evidence and it should be the scientific authorities who should back up any sort of criteria on culling. And it should be justified.”In a statement, Zambia\u0027s ministry of tourism said the culling was to maintain a suitable habitat for aquatic species and wildlife in general, noting that similar culls had taken place before.The hippos are causing considerable damage to the riverbanks and continue to threaten the sustainability of the river system, a spokesperson said.The move comes months after more than 100 hippos died from a suspected anthrax outbreak in Namibia.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It is unclear how many of them are exhibiting symptoms, but a State Department spokeswoman said on Wednesday evening that “a number of iniduals” had been sent to the United States for further testing.For months, US officials have been worried that their diplomats have been subjected to targeted attacks involving odd sounds, leading to symptoms similar to those “following concussion or minor traumatic brain injury,” the State Department says.The cases in China have broadened a medical mystery that started in 2016, when US Embassy employees and their family members began falling ill in Havana. In all, 24 of them were stricken with headaches, nausea, hearing loss, cognitive issues and other symptoms after saying they heard odd sounds. The issue has roiled relations with Cuba, which immediately fell under suspicion, and led the United States to expel Cuban diplomats.But with Americans now exhibiting similar symptoms in Guangzhou, US officials have raised suspicions about whether other countries, perhaps China or Russia, might be to blame.That is sure to complicate already strained relations with both countries over a variety of economic, political and security issues. Russia has been accused of meddling in the 2016 American presidential election, trade disputes have erupted with China and US officials fear that the Chinese are undermining relations with North Korea before a summit meeting with President Donald Trump planned for next week.The new illnesses in China come just weeks after US\u0026nbspofficials reported finding their first case here in Guangzhou, where a consulate employee got sick. Some American officials in this city live in apartment complexes filled with other foreigners and wealthy Chinese that is where the ailing employees were subjected to unusual noises.But it remains unclear whether the illnesses are the result of attacks at all. Other theories have included toxins, listening devices that accidentally emitted harmful sounds or even mass hysteria.The mystery spread to China this spring, when the first employee fell ill, and fears escalated last month when the government warned other employees to seek medical attention if they experienced unusual ailments. So far this week, another employee, his wife and their two children were evacuated after the parents exhibited neurological symptoms. Officials said they expected that at least some others would be flown out of the country as well.The illnesses appear more widespread than the State Department initially reported last month, when it said that one person had “reported subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure.”Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the symptoms of the first US employee in Guangzhou to report being ill “are very similar and entirely consistent with the medical indications that have taken place to Americans working in Cuba.”There are roughly 170 American diplomats or employees in Guangzhou, as well as their family members, and a senior US official said a sizeable number had undergone or would soon undergo testing by the State Department doctors who arrived on 31 May.The officials cautioned that no final determination had been made about what caused the illnesses.The latest American employee evacuated from Guangzhou is Mark A. Lenzi, a security engineering officer at the consulate. He left Wednesday evening with his wife and two children after having suffered in recent months from what he described in an interview as neurological symptoms. He said that his wife had similar symptoms and that they had heard unusual sounds in their apartment.On Tuesday, Mr Pompeo said in a statement that the symptoms in the first case discovered in Guangzhou were similar to the ones experienced by the 24 Americans who became ill in Havana. He said that the cause had not yet been established.The injuries in Cuba, like those in China, followed disturbing sensations of sounds and vibrations that have been described variously as the sounds made by cicadas, static, metal sheets waving or, in Mr Lenzi’s case, marbles rolling around a metal funnel.After the injuries were diagnosed in Cuba, the Trump administration expelled 15 Cuban diplomats, saying Cuban officials had failed to adequately to protect American diplomats. The Cuban government denied any involvement and questioned whether any “attacks” had taken place. US officials suggested it was too soon to consider such a response in China, though they have raised it with the Chinese government.On 23 May, the State Department disclosed that an employee stationed in China had complained of “subtle and vague, but abnormal sensations of sound and pressure” over several months from late 2017 until April. That employee, who was evacuated, was not identified.“We are not aware of any similar situations in China, either inside or outside of the diplomatic community,” the department said in the health alert. It advised others with “concerns about any symptoms or medical problems” to consult a doctor.The disclosure caused anxiety and anger among US government employees in China. Others have since come forward to report similar experiences or symptoms.In a statement on Wednesday evening, the State Department’s spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said that “a number of iniduals” had been sent to the United States for further testing and that the medical examinations continued in Guangzhou.Among those who reported symptoms was Mr Lenzi. In an email sent to the entire staff of the consulate, he complained that the first employee was evacuated in April, but that no one was told of the health concerns until a month later – after doctors in the United States had found evidence of brain trauma. The initial health alert, he said in an interview, suggested it was an isolated case. “They knew full well it wasn’t,” he said.The consulate itself, which opened in 2013, is a state-of-the-art building designed to withstand electronic eavesdropping and other security and intelligence threats. Instead, the ailing employees said they experienced the strange sounds and sensations in at least two apartment complexes where American government workers live, along with other foreigners and wealthy Chinese.In an interview before leaving China, Mr Lenzi said that he had lived in the same apartment tower as the officer evacuated in April. It is one of several high-rise buildings in The Canton Place, a modern complex built around a plaza and bordered by restaurants, cafes and galleries. Another diplomat who reported symptoms was at a different upscale building near the consulate.Lenzi said that over the past year he and his wife had experienced similar physical symptoms, including headaches, sleeplessness and nausea, and on three or four occasions they heard odd noises, though they did not put them together until the disclosures last month.Even if people are evacuated for further tests, that does not necessarily mean that they have suffered injuries or illnesses, the officials emphasised. Only 25 percent of those evacuated from Cuba, for example, were later found to have health problems.But the Chinese cases have raised alarms inside the State Department. Now led by Mr Pompeo, the department appears eager to avoid the criticism it faced over what some called its handling of the Cuba cases.In addition to the department’s medical team, William E. Todd, the acting director-general of the Foreign Service, and Michael T. Evanoff, the assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security, flew to Guangzhou to assess the situation. Their visit was not announced in advance, and they were not made available to comment before departing on Wednesday.In Tuesday’s statement, Mr Pompeo said he had created a health care task force to examine “the unexplained health incidents that have affected a number of U.S. government personnel and family members stationed overseas.”The statement left open the possibility that there have been similar events at other US embassies or consulates. One US official said that he was aware of reports of isolated episodes, but that there did not appear to be any discernible pattern.Guangzhou is a major commercial hub of 14 million people on the Pearl River, about 75 miles north of Hong Kong. In addition to the embassy in Beijing and the consulates in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, the United States operates consulates in Chengdu, Shanghai, Shenyang and Wuhan.Mr Lenzi worked for the diplomatic security department, and he believes that his work could have made him a target. Before joining the Foreign Service in 2011, he worked with the International Republican Institute, funded by Congress, promoting democratic reforms in Ukraine and Georgia – two countries where Russia has denounced American involvement.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That debate will take place on Monday, a Storting spokeswoman told The Independent.Following that, it must receive royal assent from King Harald V before it officially becomes law.During the debate politicians said they believed it was important that students and teachers be allowed to see each others’ faces and communicate openly.The Labour Party’s Jan Bøhler said: “It is crucial for a good learning environment that one can see each other’s face throughout the open school landscape.”Mathilde Tybring-Gjedde. of the Conservative Party, added: “Tolerance for differences is essential, but at the same time, we must ensure that all people have equal participation and equal opportunities.“Kindergartens should be good learning places and meeting places. It is crucial for the children that they can have open and good communication with safe adults.”The niqab covers a woman’s whole face apart from her eyes while the burqa adds a transparent veil over the eyes. The ban would not affect the hijab, Reuters\u0026nbspreported when the bill was proposed.Åshild Bruun-Gundersen, of the conservative Progress Party which is part of Norway’s ruling coalition, called the burqa and niqab “suppressive garments that prevent integration” that prevent women “from living a free life”.Her party, which favours tighter rules on immigration, wants a full ban on the coverings in public places, she said.The Socialist Left Party (SV), however, said it would not support a nationwide ban because evidence suggested that people wearing the coverings in schools was a “minimal problem”.Educational institutions, in their responses to a consultation, indicated it was “hardly a problem”, SV’s Mona Fagerås said, adding that local disputes have been settled through dialogue.Norway’s National Union of Students also believed the proposal was “not in line with the principle of equal right to education”, she said.Ms Fagerås added: “Work on women’s oppression and increased gender equality need to be strengthened. To introduce a national ban on face-covering garments does not solve the problem of women in Norway today being exposed to negative social control and honour-related violence.”The move towards instituting a ban comes nearly two years after Norway first set out its intention to restrict their usage.Last week,\u0026nbspneighbouring Denmark became the latest European country to introduce a ban on face coverings including Islamic veils.The government there claimed its new law, which does not ban headscarves, turbans or the traditional Jewish skullcap, was not aimed at any religion.Amnesty International criticised the ban, saying “all women should be free to dress as they please and to wear clothing that expresses their identity or beliefs”.“Whilst some specific restrictions on the wearing of full-face veils for the purposes of public safety may be legitimate, this blanket ban is neither necessary nor proportionate and violates the rights to freedom of expression and religion,” said\u0026nbspits Europe director, Gauri van Gulik.Police must use “common sense” in enforcing the law, Denmark’s justice minister said. It allows people to cover their faces if there is a “recognisable purpose” to doing so, like wearing a motorcycle helmet or in cold weather.France, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Netherlands and the German region of Bavaria have all implemented restrictions on wearing full face coverings in public.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

salvo ahead of the next round of face-to-face talks over the UK\u0027s departure from the EU, the Tory Cabinet minister hit out at European Commission negotiators for trying to put conditions on future military and counter-terrorism cooperation.Any move by others to place conditions on our offer will only serve to put the safety of everybody\u0026rsquos citizens at risk, he said.He also savaged Brussels for trying to freeze the UK out of the pan-European Galileo satellite navigation system.Put simply, the Commission\u0027s position seems to be shooting itself in the foot just to

system.Mr\u0026nbspDavis heads to Brussels next Monday to resume the wrangling with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.With the talks on a future trade deal currently deadlocked, the Cabinet minister is braced for the most intensive sessions so far.And he raised the stakes in the negotiations yesterday by venting frustration at the EU\u0027s refusal to accept Britain\u0027s unconditional offer of a continuing close security partnership once the country has quit the bloc.Mr\u0026nbspDavis insisted that current cooperation\u0026nbspworked\u0026nbspwell in helping European nations pick up on suspicious\u0026nbspbehaviour and share\u0026nbspdetails\u0026nbspof potential terrorist attacks.As the\u0026nbspthreats\u0026nbspwe face continue to evolve so must our collaboration, the EU Exit Secretary said.Because we must work together \u0026mdash and quickly \u0026mdash if we want to avoid any gap in our operational capability, a gap that could be exploited, putting people in harm\u0026rsquos way.He added: The first duty of government is to keep its citizens safe.And it\u0026rsquos the pursuit of that safety that made Britain make that unconditional offer to the European Union.Any move by others to place conditions on our offer will only serve to put the safety of everybody\u0026rsquos citizens at risk.Because when terrorists set off bombs or fire guns \u0026mdash be in it on the streets of Paris, or London, or Manchester or Brussels \u0026mdash they don\u0026rsquot check the passports of their victims first.Mr\u0026nbspDavis was scathing about warning from Brussels that a UK outside the EU could be excluded from the Galileo satellite network that British scientific expertise and investment had helped to build.He said: Because Galileo is so important, UK industry and military experts have been instrumental in its design.We have spent hundreds of millions of pounds on the project, and thousands of hours of work has been dedicated to making sure the system is secure.But now, the Commission\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspsuggesting that by being involved, the United Kingdom poses a risk to the security interests of the European Union.British companies are

BrusselsMr\u0026nbspDavis also raised concerns about threats to freeze the UK out of the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS), which allows the sharing of tens of thousands of pieces of information about criminal convictions between EU nations every year.We are consistently one of the top three contributors and users of ECRIS.\u0026nbsp Last year alone, we sent and received more than 600 requests and notifications a day, the EU Exit Secretary said.If we were frozen out of ECRIS, neither the United Kingdom nor member states would be able to quickly obtain criminal records information from each other.Courts might no longer be able to take into account previous convictions when deciding on guilt, sentence or bail.And law enforcement agencies may no longer be able to protect the public when dangerous iniduals move between the United Kingdom and the European Union.Mr\u0026nbspDavis also feared the UK\u0026nbspdefence\u0026nbspindustry was facing\u0026nbspdiscrimmination\u0026nbspin the awarding of contracts from the new European Defence Fund.The UK and our industry are already making a meaningful contribution.But, the EU\u0026rsquos approach to the provisional regulation risks damaging potential cooperation in the longer term, he said.On all of these, unhelpful precedents and assumptions on how third countries should cooperate with the EU\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphindering projects that help the entire continent.Dogmatic responses based on what has happened before don\u0026rsquot help anyone.In a warning of retaliation, the senior Tory added: And actually, when I hear that by going beyond precedent for the UK, agreements with other countries will have to be re-examined.Mr\u0026nbspDavis said Britain could be proud of its role in defending peace and security on the continent and was determined to continue to do so.We\u0026rsquore proud of the role that we have played in making our continent safer. We have taken such actions because we are friends and allies of the European\u0026nbspUnion,\u0026nbspand its member states. Europe\u0026rsquos security is our security, he said.We want a comprehensive deep partnership with the European Union on a whole range of matters, that have an impact on our security.Ahead of next week\u0027s talks, he urged the European Commission to accept Britain\u0027s departure and\u0026nbsprecognise\u0026nbspthat Brexit did not mean the country was turning inward and away from Europe.I\u0026nbsprecognise\u0026nbspthat Brexit isn\u0026rsquot popular for many people in the EU.Going around Europe, it\u0026rsquos clear that people do not want us to leave.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here’s all you need to know...Each year in the UK Father’s Day takes place on the third Sunday of June - which falls on June 17 in 2018.According to one tale, Fathers Day first began because of a woman named Grace Golden Clayton from Fairmount, West Virginia.An orphan, Grace lobbied her local Methodist ministers for a church service to honour fathers in 1908.The story goes that she was inspired to do this after a mining disaster killed 362 local men.Their deaths orphaned more than 1,000 children and Grace wanted to pay tribute to the children’s dead fathers - as well as her own.Another story involves the daughter of a civil war veteran, Sonora Smart Dodd, from Arkansas.While listening to a sermon for Mother’s Day, Sonora became convinced of the need to celebrate dads too.She then campaigned to her religious leaders for a special service dedicated to fathers.In 1966, President Johnson designated that the third Sunday in June should be Fathers Day.Six years later, Father’s Day was made a permanent national holiday in the US when, in 1972, President Richard Nixon signed it into law.While countries including the UK, Ireland, US, France, Cyprus, South Africa, Netherlands, Greece, Japan, Canada and Saudi Arabia celebrate Father’s Day every June, others have the day on a completely different date.Instead, Australia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand celebrate their dads in September.Many people believe that the celebration date is different in the southern hemisphere because June is their autumn, rather than their spring, and the day can be marketed better in the spring season.And in Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal and Croatia it’s in March.For Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia and Iceland, Father’s Day celebrations are held on the second Sunday of November - and in Bulgaria it’s on the same day as Boxing Day, December 26.The dates usually correspond to each country’s culture and traditions.While there may be many different dates dedicated to dads across the globe, one thing is for certain, they all celebrate the same thing –fantastic fathers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Dhuhr is observed shortly after noon to again remember God and seek his guidance.Muslims must fast between sunrise and sunset every day in Ramadan.However, they enjoy one meal pre-dawn and one after sunset each day.The Suhur is consumed in the morning, as early as 2.30am, in the latter stages of the holy month.Breads, potatoes, eggs and rice are typically enjoyed as part of the Suhur, in addition to dairy products and fresh vegetables.The Iftar is a blessing, often enjoyed as a community, after sunset. This can be as late as 9.40pm in the latter part of the holy month.Fruits and vegetables are usually big parts of the Iftar, as are many delicacies unique to the Islam religion.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t want to compromise,” he confessed to Vice online news. Now we all know. Our grovelling attempt to buy a friendly, friction-free and costly trade deal was doomed from the start.Brussels was never going to let Britain be better off outside.The Commission was determined to punish us for daring to leave. For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash. There would be a stampede to stop Mrs May reaching the exit.Now it seems most if not all those casualties could have escaped if they had not been penned in their flats by fire-brigade diktat.We raise our hats to the fire service teams who risked death in this hideous blaze.

Imagine how fast Tory fortunes, shored up by Leave voters, will nose-dive if Brexit is fatally wounded.Remainers already blame them for holding the referendum. Leavers will blame them for negating 17.4million votes.There is only one solution. Tory Remainers must put aside their personal views and respect the manifesto promises they stood on last year.When Home Secretary Sajid Javid says it will cost lives, he’s not exaggerating. He’s pointing out the reality of Brussels turning its back on the peerless UK ­security services it relies so heavily on.EU bureaucrats plainly consider a few more terrorist victims mere collateral damage in their zeal to punish us.This is the truth behind the “happy, inclusive” EU of Remainer fantasies.It is a hard-nosed trading cabal, run mafia-style by unelected bullies treating voters as cannon fodder.IT would be an act of national self-harm for MPs to reject a third Heathrow runway.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is poised to give it the nod, possibly today. The Commons must back it this month.Aside from the huge boost to the economy, it is crucial to improve our global transport links for the post-Brexit era.But The Sun has long supported expanding Heathrow AND Gatwick.This new runway will be at capacity almost as soon as it is finally finished.So much for our country becoming nasty and intolerant!We warmly congratulate “Lost Voice Guy” Lee Ridley — and Simon Cowell.A belting series, with a wonderful winner.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it’s up to them to decide.”On whether he will walk out of the Cabinet, the Brexit Secretary added: “That’s a question I think for the Prime Minister”.But Mrs May was said to have already despatched the proposal’s blueprint to Brussels to be presented to EU negotiators today.Hitting back at Mr Davis, a senior No10 source said: “We have to put something to Brussels that is negotiable, not something that will be thrown out by them immediately.“If we don’t, our Remain backbenchers next week will take it as their excuse to vote the lot of it down.”In another act of defiance, it also emerged last night that Mr Davis refused to present the backstop plan today when it is published, leaving No10 forced to approach other minister to do the PR job.Mr Davis had been scheduled to publish the plans for the backstop on Thursday but it is now likely to be launched by Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, instead.The PM also faced embarrassment in PMQs yesterday when she was unable to tell Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn when the government’s full white paper on Brexit will be published.Mr Davis is also locked in a bitter row with Mrs May after she delayed publication of the blueprint until next month, after a crucial EU summit on June 28.And she was harangued during the tense Commons session by angry Tory backbenchers, including MP Henry Smith who demanded: “Please can we have some delivery”.A former Tory leader also told Mrs May she must issue an ultimatum to the EU to press on with trade talks immediately or Britain will prepare to walk away.Leading Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith has issued his gravest warning yet that time is running out fast to cut a good Brexit deal, with just nine months to go before the UK’s exit.Heaping blame on Brussels negotiators for dictating the slow pace, Mr Duncan Smith called for Mrs May to enforce “a change to the way we are negotiating”.He added: “I think we have to arrive at the June council and say we have to do trade now and if we don’t, and if you don’t want to start the trade discussions, then we really have to say we are planning and will continue to plan to leave without a deal”.The former Tory boss also admitted there may be massive queues at Dover if a good deal is not struck, and ministers must urgently start preparing for the potential chaos there too.Labour’s Shadow Brexit Minister added: “It hardly instils confidence in the Government’s approach to Brexit when it’s supposed key negotiator is openly talking about resigning.“David Davis should stop worrying about his own job and start taking action to protect the jobs of the British people.”No10 was also accused of showing the backstop blueprints to Remain fans like Chancellor Philip Hammond over the weekend while Leavers such as BoJo and Michael Gove only got them yesterday, The Times reported.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Is it an all-weather backstop?”But Keir Starmer, Labour’s Shadow Brexit Secretary, called it “another embarrassing day for the Government”.He said Mrs May has “signed up to a flawed proposal which is inconsistent with her earlier commitments”.Earlier senior Brexiteers had been left furious at reportedly being left in the dark over the plans, after they were not shown the back-stop outline until hours before it was due to be published earlier this week.Meanwhile several leading Remain-supporting cabinet ministers were shown it at the weekend.One government figure told The Times it was a “disgrace” and a mark of the “utter shambles” of the state of Brexit negotiations in government.The document itself was causing consternation, which Eurosceptics said would put Britain “in purgatory”.With the ongoing wrangle about what type of long-term customs agreement the UK wants after Brexit seemingly set to continue, the fall-back position is becoming more likely to be required.So what is it?When the UK exits the EU, it will need a new agreement on goods travelling from Northern Ireland and the Republic.So far Britain and Brussels have failed to agree on any sort of permanent deal, so in order to break the deadlock Mrs May agreed to a fall-back option in case one cannot be found by the time we exit the bloc.Known as the “back-stop”, it would come into force after the transition period ends in December 2020 if theres no deal.It would mean the UK would keep existing trade rules, and prevent border posts being set up and trade grinding to a halt.But its original form did not have a fixed end point for the plan to finish, leading to fears it would end up being a permanent solution.This would prevent the UK from signing trade deals with other countries outside the EU, which Brexiteers say would render the vote to leave pointless.It has now been amended, saying the UK expects the future arrangement to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest.That would already mean delaying our effective Brexit date until more than five years after the EU referendum, and the wording leaves the potential for it to last even longer.However without a fixed end date Brexiteers were worried it would lead to a “Hotel California Brexit” where we would never really leave Brussels control.A senior Tory had warned Mrs May she could not afford to lose him.Former Brexit minister David Jones told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: We need to make sure that David Davis stays at the negotiating table.“Anything that caused him to leave would be deeply regrettable and deeply damaging to the country.The Sun had revealed last night the 69-year-old ex-SAS reservist told friends he will stay and fight the “people trying to box me in”, and today it appears he has agreed to stay on.This morning Mrs May’s former chief of staff Nick Timothy said his old boss had made a “mistake” in agreeing to a customs backstop at all.He warned a “Brexit summer crisis” now looms after she agreed to the EUs interim backstop plan in March to try and break the deadlock in the Brexit negotiations.After today’s crunch meetings things don’t get any easier for the PM, as she will fly out tonight to Canada for the G7 meetings and a showdown with Donald Trump over his steel tariffs and the looming trade war.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So we felt that a single community throughout the world would be a good thing.Theorists also claim the inclusion of Bill Clinton at the meetings in 1991 - before he became US President - and Tony Blair’s attendance in 1993 - before he became PM - are examples of the group’s power.Bilderberg attendees have denied controlling global politics but one member told the  that some meetings had influenced international affairs.The man said: During the Falklands war, the British governments request for international sanctions against Argentina fell on stony ground. But at a Bilderberg meeting in, I think, Denmark, David Owen stood up and gave the most fiery speech in favour of imposing them.Well, the speech changed a lot of minds. Im sure that various foreign ministers went back to their respective countries and told their leaders what David Owen had said. And you know what? Sanctions were imposed.In her book A Choice, Not an Echo, political activist Phyllis Schlafly suggested that the US Republican Party is controlled by the Bilderberg group and claimed the party was being manipulated by Bilderberg, paving the way for world communism.In 2010, former Cuban president Fidel Castro wrote an article for the Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma in which he cited a book on the meetings, describing the sinister cliques and the Bilderberg lobbyists manipulating the public to install a world government that knows no borders and is not accountable to anyone but its own self.It has also been claimed that one Bilderberg founder, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, was a member of the Nazis - which he denied in one of the last interviews he gave before his death in 2004, saying: I can swear this with my hand on the Bible: I was never a Nazi.This years meeting will be chaired by Henri de Castries, the Chairman of the Institut Mantaigne - a nonprofit, trans-partisan think tank based in Paris, France.Participants this year include bank bosses, security experts, academics, political figures, columnists, CEOs, construction industry experts, aviation experts and scientists.Amongst the attendees this year are: José Manuel Barroso - the former president of the European Commission and current chairman of Goldman Sachs InternationalDominique Anglade - the Deputy Premier of Quebec and Minister of Economy Science and InnovationAudrey Azoulay - the Director General of UNESCOBen van Beurden - CEO of Royal Dutch ShellAna P.

They also offer a great range of services and repairs for added peace of mind. Wheels first    It makes sense to start with a bike\u0027s wheels when you are doing maintenance. There are a number of things you need to check here to keep things safe. Tyres are the most obvious thing of all, so let\u0027s start there. If you haven\u0027t been out on the bike recently then it\u0027s very likely that the tyres will have deflated. Bear this in mind if you\u0027re planning a trip because you\u0027ll want to test them to ensure they hold air. Inflate them , leave the bike for a few days and come back. Hopefully they will stay inflated, but if not you might have a puncture. There are a couple of ways to deal with punctures. If you\u0027re a bit short of time, or out and about, then using a tyre sealant can be a good solution. This liquid is pumped into the tyre and will seal small punctures immediately. Slime Bike Tyre Sealant is \u0026pound9.99 and not only fixes existing punctures but also prevents future holes from causing a problem.  For most punctures you may need to use a puncture repair kit. It\u0027s a bit more time-consuming to do this as you need to remove the wheel first. If the bike doesn’t have quick release wheels then use a spanner or a tool like the Bike Hut 3 Way Socket for \u0026pound5.99 (which comes in two sizes, so check what size wheel nuts your bike uses). Check out the Halfords guide to puncture repair. Once the wheel is off, using the Halfords Essentials Puncture Repair Kit , above, which is just \u0026pound12, will allow you to get the tyre off the wheel using the included levers. Some punctures might be really obvious, if not then inflate the inner tube - if you don\u0027t have a pump why not pick up the Halfords Metal Track Bike , below, for just \u0026pound20 (save \u0026pound5).  Once inflated, submerge in a bucket or bath of water and look for the bubbles. The puncture repair kit comes with chalk and a crayon to mark the area you need to fix. Once you\u0027ve found the puncture a brief rub with sandpaper before you apply the patch helps the adhesive stick properly. Large punctures will require a new inner tube. If you\u0027re planning a big family cycling trip then you\u0027ll also want to make sure you have a compact pump with you when you\u0027re out and about. Check out the Bikehut High Pressure Bike Pump for \u0026pound15 (save \u0026pound4). You should also carry spare inner tubes with you as some punctures can’t be repaired. Gears may need specialist attention    Although expert riders may feel confident adjusting their own gears it\u0027s not a job to undertake unless you know what you\u0027re doing. The big problem with messing about with gears is that you can make a simple problem worse and render your own, or your children\u0027s bike, impossible to ride. Ultimately though, it\u0027s not worth taking risks with your family\u0027s bikes and their safety. Instead, get an in-store Halfords expert to help you get your gears working again. A FREE Bike Check will locate problems and then a trained expert will be able to fix them safely for you. A regular service will help to stop these problems before they appear and will likely be cheaper than repair. Also take a look at the Halfords Adult Bike Care Plan and the Kids Plan to keep your bikes in tip-top condition. Brakes are crucial    It\u0027s obvious but important to mention that without brakes you\u0027re in big trouble. Every bike needs regular checks on its braking system, as you ride it\u0027s inevitable that cables stretch slightly and brake pads can wear down. This needs to be corrected, and because brakes are crucial you might want to consider popping in to Halfords to have them serviced. You can certainly tell if you have a problem first though. Test the front and back brakes on your own and your kid\u0027s bikes regularly to make sure they stop the wheels. You can inspect the brake pads to make sure they’re aligned with the rims, if not they need to be serviced. A FREE Bike Check at Halfords will locate any problems and the in-store experts can get your brakes working perfectly again. Halfords has Bike Care Plans which cost \u0026pound15 for a year children\u0027s bikes and \u0026pound25 for adults . These plans include a silver service which checks everything from wear and damage to aligning the brakes. Never break the chain    Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s very unlikely that you\u0027ll suffer a broken chain , but it can happen. If it does you\u0027ll be stuck, so it\u0027s really worth having a repair kit with you, especially if you\u0027re mountain biking. Check out the Park Tool Chain Brute Tool for just \u0026pound9.98, ideal if you need to repair a broken chain on the road. You might also need to carry some spare chain links with you too - you\u0027ll need to make sure they are compatible with your bike. It\u0027s also worth keeping your family\u0027s bike chains well oiled, or as most people say in cycling circles lubricated. You can use oil, and this is the cheapest option at just \u0026pound4 for Cycle Oil, below . You should also clean your chain before applying lubricant, there are special cleaners to help with this.  More expensive lubricants come in either wet or dry formulas. Wet is more weather resistant but dry is more likely to be washed away by rain but doesn\u0027t gunk up your chain. Dry lubes aren’t well-suited to, say, commuting where the weather is unpredictable. Most people will want wet lubricants like Muc-Off , now \u0026pound2.99 (save \u0026pound1 off RRP). Ceramic lubricants are something of a mid-way between wet and dry offering the advantages of both, check the Muc-Off Ceramic Lube \u0026pound7.49 (save \u0026pound2.50 off RRP). Sometimes chains will come off when cycling. In some cases because they have stretched and may need shortening or replacing. In most cases they can be relocated by hand although you may want to wear protective gloves for this. Tighten everything The last step for bike maintenance should be to check the bolts, like those on the wheels, are well tightened. There\u0027s no need to over-tighten, as this can cause problems too, but make sure nuts are all firmly secured. A spanner set or special bike tool will be needed, but the Halfords 9 Piece Combination Spanner Set is just \u0026pound20 and should cover most bike nut sizes.

The embattled Prime Minister has made a humiliating climbdown to appease her Brexit Secretary - after a string of meetings and threats to quit. She\u0027s agreed to limit her backup plan for post-Brexit customs to one year - er, sort of - in what we in Westminster call a \u0027fudge\u0027. She was up against the clock to get it. This evening she\u0027s flying to meet Donald Trump at the G7 summit. So it\u0027s been a day of chaos in Westminster with journalists being told opposite things within minutes of each other - or even at the same time. We\u0027re here to guide you through the barmy \u0027backstop\u0027 row, how it broke out, and how it ended. Here\u0027s your minute-by-minute explanation of the last 24 or so hours. The EU has a customs union. This means all 28 member states can trade with each other without any checks or duties on goods. Theresa May has said Britain will leave this after December 2020, so she can sign trade deals with non-EU countries. But officials have warned a new UK customs system won\u0027t be ready in time. So they\u0027ve devised a \u0027backstop\u0027 - a backup plan that will carry on some EU customs rules in the UK if there\u0027s no deal. It is designed to stop ports grinding to a halt and Northern Ireland setting up border posts, which could lead to violence. Yet Brexiteers were furious because it had no set end date. In a huge Tory row, they warned it would trap Britain half-in, half-out the EU. After frantic last-minute talks, and threats to quit by Brexit Secretary David Davis, a time limit was put in - December 2021. Yet the government only expects to follow that time limit. It is not legally binding. And the EU poured cold water on it. Britain and the EU also disagree about what the backstop will do. EU plans back in March would have kept Northern Ireland aligned with Brussels customs rules, but Theresa May rejected this because it draws a border between the province and the mainland. So she drew up Britain\u0027s own backstop, which is now being put to the EU for discussion. The UK plan is a temporary customs arrangement allowing totally tariff-free trade between the EU and the whole of the UK. So the UK would carry on being in the EU Customs Union in all but name until December 2021. But the UK also wants to sign new trade deals with nations outside the EU. Britain even wants to implement parts of these deals that don\u0027t relate to the backstop. Brussels has repeatedly said this won\u0027t be possible - so the new plan is setting up for a big battle with the EU. And as time ticks on, the backstop will become less of a Plan B and more of a Plan A. It\u0027ll turn from backstop... to frontstop. Shock reports emerge that Theresa May has handed Cabinet ministers a paper on the backstop - and wants to publish it within one day.  Furious Brexiteers start briefing Westminster journalists that they\u0027re being \u0027bounced\u0027 into a decision with \u0027mad\u0027 speed.  They complain it has no firm time limit for when the backstop would end - leaving Britain half-in, half-out of the EU.  Reports soon emerge that the chief objector is none other than the Brexit Secretary himself - David Davis.  4.25pm  At a Q\u0026ampA in Westminster, David Davis shocks journalists by leaving them in no doubt there are big splits and hinting he could resign. Asked if he can stay in his job if he doesn\u0027t approve of the backstop, Mr Davis said: “That’s a question I think for the Prime Minister, to be honest.” 10pm  Brexiteer anger deepens as it\u0027s reported Cabinet Remainers saw the document over the weekend - days before some Brexiteers, including Boris Johnson. A source tells the Times it is a disgrace and an utter shambles. Meanwhile David Davis holds inconclusive talks with Theresa May on Wednesday evening. Thursday 7 June 8.20am  Tory ex-Brexit minister David Jones, an ally of David Davis, takes to the airwaves to row in behind battling David Davis. He warns the backstop with no time limit would damage Britain by tying it to EU rules. But he calls on Mr Davis to keep his job, saying losing him now would be upsetting and deeply dangerous for the country. 8.44am David Davis is seen strolling through Parliament smiling, tieless and carefree on his way to a meeting with Theresa May. 10am  Theresa May holds separate, face-to-face crisis talks in her Commons office with \u0027three Brexiteers\u0027 David Davis, Boris Johnson and Liam Fox. The Brexit Secretary\u0027s meeting is the longest and goes on for more than half an hour as the pair try to thrash out a compromise. 10.27am With the ministers still in a Vatican-style conclave, Tory Brexiteer Nadine Dorries gives undoubtedly the most helpful contribution of the day. She tweets: David Davis is ex SAS He’s trained to survive. He’s also trained to take people out. #Brexit   11.25am White smoke!  A Downing Street spokeswoman tells us the talks were constructive. Asked if any of the trio of Brexiteers threatened to resign she says: No. Asked if she is confident Mr Davis will still be in his job by the end of the day she says: Yes.  Government sources indicate to us that the meeting was conclusive. They say the backstop will probably be published before the meeting of the Brexit \u0027 war cabinet \u0027 at 12.30pm.  11.59am No white smoke after all!  David Davis is called BACK in to see the Prime Minister, according to the BBC after talks were inconclusive. This is the exact opposite of what journalists were told half an hour earlier. 12.16pm A source close to David Davis tells Sky News: He\u0027s not planning to resign. But then one minute later... 12.17pm An hour after the plan was supposedly agreed the threat of David Davis resigning raises its head yet again.  A \u0027senior government source\u0027, presumably close to David Davis, tells ITV: DD is not a man to be bullied. He has demanded a clearly defined time limit to the backstop and has stated he will walk if he doesn’t get it. If this is a game of chicken between the PM and DD there will only be one winner. 12.30pm The Brexit war Cabinet meeting begins and lo and behold, the paper isn\u0027t published.  1.08pm After chaotic behind-the-scenes horse trading the backstop plan is finally published. David Davis looks like he\u0027s won a victory with a date of December 2021 when the backstop should end. But it\u0027s clear his victory may prove hollow because the government only expects the date to happen - there\u0027s no guarantee. 1.47pm EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier pours cold water on the plan almost immediately.  He tweets: We will examine it with 3 questions: is it a workable solution to avoid a hard border? Does it respect the integrity of the single market and customs union? Is it an all-weather backstop? 1.47pm and 4 seconds Frantic debate ensues over what on earth an all-weather backstop is. 2.11pm  Now it\u0027s war between the Brexiteers in government and, er, the Brexiteers in government. A source tells the Times: DD claims of victory are simply delusional. Even Barnier is now expressing sympathy for him. It\u0027s beyond a joke now. 3.32pm "},{"url":null,"title":"london mayor sadiq khan demands","story":"NewsLondon mayor Sadiq Khan demands 6,000 more police officers as he blames Tory cuts for spiralling violent crimeThe capital\u0027s mayor said he \"accepts responsibility\" for a crimewave that has killed dozens - but refused to apologise for drawing the link with cuts\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomPolitical reporter13:04, 7 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSadiq Khan today demanded 6,000 more police officers in London as he insisted Tory cuts were to blame for spiralling violent crime. The capital\u0027s mayor said he accepts responsibility for a crimewave that has left dozens dead on the streets of his city so far this year. But he said he would not apologise for drawing the link with Tory cuts that have removed 21,000 officers from England and Wales since 2010. The Labour politician told LBC radio: I\u0027m the Mayor of London, I\u0027m the Police and Crime Commissioner - I accept responsibility for what happens in our city. Security is the biggest concern that I have, it’s the one thing that keeps me up at night. Whether it’s terrorism threats, whether it\u0027s the surge in serious violent crime. But I am not going to apologise for explaining the context.  Mr Khan added: All of us except for the Government accept there’s a link between cutting resources and serious violent crime. That’s not the sole reason by the way, but there’s a link. Pressed on whether he should apologise, he said: We can dance around the question of how much responsibility is mine as opposed to the Government\u0027s - we\u0027re doing what we can. Scotland Yard currently has around 30,000 officers and Mr Khan said the ideal figure would be 36,000, like New York. 36,000 would be the ideal scenario, but any increase from the government would be welcome, he said.

His antics were filmed as he attached a camera to his helmet and recorded their startled reactions across London, shocking passersby and even making one woman spill her coffee. A group of several young men are given a huge fright as they wandered into a bike lane while other offending pedestrians are given similar shocks across locations in central London. The approach has had a decidedly mixed response - with one man strolling in a cycle lane lashing out and striking the lycra-clad vigilante in anger.  The rider is believed to have used a Fire Chief air horn, which manufacturers say can reach up to 120 decibels – roughly similar to the noise of a jet taking off. Reckless Bradley, who uploaded the video, wrote on YouTube : “I am fed up with people walking in the cycle lane in London. Its like they don\u0027t even care that is there. I decided to make my presence more known by investing in an air horn.

But the markings have started peeling away in places and are no longer in straight lines on the street in Stoke-on-Trent.  The parking restrictions remain in place but residents fear motorists will be left puzzled or will park up thinking the lines are no longer enforceable, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports.  They\u0027ve called on Cadent to come back and fix the mess.  One leading city councillor has branded the situation in Ramsey Street, Fenton, as totally unacceptable. Fenton worker Sylvia Dymond posted a picture of the crooked lines on social media after they started flaking away. She said: I don\u0027t know if they are temporary or not. People are quite shocked by them and it appears they are peeling away after just six weeks or so. I\u0027ve never seen double-yellow lines like this before. It was unclear whether the lines were affected by the recent hot weather or vehicles driving over them. Local resident Denis Corbishley, 57, said: These double yellow lines look a mess.

Anthony Hirst, 48, was arrested after the foul-mouthed post went viral and disgusted social media users complained to Merseyside Police, a court heard. Alfie, from Liverpool, died aged 23 months of a degenerative brain disease after parents Tom Evans and Kate James fought a high-profile campaign over his end-of-life care.  Hirst\u0027s disturbing message on Facebook said: F Alfie the scouce little c  Let him die. That be 97 then after the hillsbourgh 96. One less Scouse to worry about bin licking gob****s.(SIC)  The message, which included three smiley face emojis, was sent to one person but was then widely shared. It has provoked such outrage that Hirst has had to flee his home.  The jobless ex-bakery worker, from Burnley, Lancashire, yesterday admitted sending a grossly offensive message when he appeared at the town’s magistrates’ court. Hirst, whose own four-month-old daughter died in 2010, told detectives during an interview that he couldn’t explain why he’d sent the message, the court heard. He was responding to a text he’d received expressing sympathy for little Alfie\u0027s plight together with an image of a candle, days before his death on April 28, the court was told. When questioned by police, Hirst said he was depressed, the court heard.  He told a probation officer he sent the middle-of-the night reply without thinking, and then went back to sleep. Hirst received threats after the message was made public and had to move home, the court heard. When police spoke to the defendant, he said he had deleted the message and Facebook account. Prosecutor Tracy Yates added: He said he was depressed and not in the right frame of mind. He couldn\u0027t explain any reason why he sent that message. Cathryn Fell, defending, said Hirst responded completely inappropriately, to the message sent to him. She added: He sent a message to one person. He has not put it on a public platform. Unfortunately, they have thereafter shared it with others and that\u0027s why it\u0027s effectively mushroomed.  Miss Fell said: He says \u0027I know it was wrong. It was stupid. I can\u0027t explain it. I\u0027m sorry for what happened\u0027. The solicitor said Hirst had since had to move out of his home because of threats. She went on: He\u0027s fully appreciated the effect it\u0027s had on people and it\u0027s affected him back. A probation officer who interviewed the defendant said he had lost both his parents within the last couple of years and lost a child in 2010. She told the court: He has been diagnosed with depression recently by his GP and has been medicated. His GP has referred him for some grief counselling.

Cherelle Farrugia, from Cardiff, is thought to be one of just 35 people affected by the condition worldwide and says it has turned her life in to a “nightmare”.  She must make sure someone is in the house with her when she showers as she\u0027s been warned she could go into anaphylactic shock, Wales Online reports.  Cherelle gave birth to her daughter Willow in November 2017 but six weeks on she developed a painful rash every time she had a shower. It took doctors three months to diagnose her with aquagenic urticaria, a rare condition which leads to hives developing rapidly after the skin comes into contact with water.  As a result the Cardiff and Vale College student is unable to take her daughter swimming. There is currently no cure for the severe allergy but medics believe it is linked to changes in Cherelle’s hormones after giving birth to Willow. “About six weeks after having my daughter I realised that every time I got out of the shower my skin would be really itchy,” she said. “I initially thought it must be caused by the soap I was using. Then I thought it was the temperature of the water. “But I tried all different temperatures – cold, hot, lukewarm and body temperature – but my body reacted to all of them.”  Cherelle, who lives in Fairwater, also crossed chlorine allergy and bacteria in the shower head off her list of possible causes. “I was still reacting to everything but I didn’t think it could possibly be a water allergy. I’d never heard of such a thing. “The first doctor I saw told me it was impossible but the second doctor I saw had heard of it and referred me to an allergist.  “The waiting list on the NHS was five months so I decided to go private.”   Cherelle, who is training to become a mental health councillor, said she developed postpartum depression after the birth of Willow which is likely to have triggered the allergy. “It was horrific and it hit me out of nowhere. I was borderline suicidal,” she said. “I couldn’t get out of bed, I couldn’t leave the house, and I was convinced something was going to happen to my daughter. I wouldn’t get anyone hold her. “But I am very fortunate to be super close to my mum and dad and my partner is amazing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"stomach churning moment man hundreds","story":"NewsStomach-churning moment man has HUNDREDS of blackheads squeezed from face after \u0027years of not washing properly\u0027A dermatologist had to spend half an hour using tweezers and pliers to yank the gunge blocking the sweat ducts in a procedure carried out in Thailand\u0026nbspShareByElaine McCahill12:20, 7 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis stomach-churning footage shows a man having HUNDREDS of blackheads squeezed from his face after years of not washing properly and only eating fried food.

Hello! magazine says Queen Maxima has pulled out of all upcoming engagments. She was due to attend Holland Festival, a musical event, this week but will no longer make an appearance. Queen Maxima was also due to join her husband King Willem-Alexander on their tour of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia next week but will no longer attend.

It was a big move for me.“Bobby Geddes (keeper coach) has been great and the gaffer has been brilliant because he’s put faith in me to put me on the bench and play me in the last game.“That’s the biggest thing for a goalkeeper, having the manager’s faith in you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee man denies running off with a child in a buggy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA man is to stand trial on

\u0026#8216S\u0026#8217 sitting outside his house.But after he sold it in October 1985, it took almost exactly 26 years for it to come full circle back to him.David said he always had an interest in cars and motorbikes but didn\u0026#8217t buy his first classic car until 1981 when his and his wife Maureen\u0026#8217s children were older.\u0026#8220When you were younger and first married you couldn\u0026#8217t afford to buy a second car, a classic car,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220As the family grow you then find you find you have a little more finances to indulge,\u0026#8221 Maureen added.He first bought the Mini Cooper \u0026#8216S\u0026#8217 on July 20, 1984 before selling it to a man in Meigle on October 9, 1985, but it was left in a state of disrepair and David said the last time he saw it was \u0026#8220sitting forlornly in a garden in Meigle\u0026#8221.David joined the Tayside Classic Car Club in 2001, when a work colleague suggested he come along to a meeting.\u0026#8220It started from there and then I started attending show with the club and I\u0026#8217ve been with them ever since, 17 years,\u0026#8221 he said.He didn\u0026#8217t hear anything of the Mini until Maurice Cruickshank from Arbroath joined the club and said he had a Cooper \u0026#8216S\u0026#8217 with the same registration as the one David used to own, which he had bought and extensively restored.So when Maurice said he was looking to sell it, David decided it was time to bring it back home again and he bought it October 7, 2011.The Kingsmuir couple now take it along to different shows with the club, of which David is now on the committee of while the couple share the duty of newsletter editor.The club was great as it accepted all different types of classic cars which suits the couple, who also have a 2001 Jaguar XJ8 Executive and a 1961 Hillman Minx 1500cc among their collection.\u0026#8220What you\u0026#8217ve said you like about it is there\u0026#8217s a big variety of vehicles,\u0026#8221 Maureen said to David.\u0026#8220When you go to a one make club you only talk about that one make of vehicle,\u0026#8221 David said.\u0026#8220I find it more interesting than a one make club.\u0026#8220You usually find someone who\u0026#8217s had that problem or knows someone so if you\u0026#8217re stuck for hint you can find someone.\u0026#8221David grew up in Kirriemuir, but said his father was originally from Cornwall and he had traced his roots back to Central Europe.\u0026#8220I went and did one of those DNA test,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220The results come back that I\u0026#8217m actually from around Germany and France\u0026#8220I kind of suspected that because I used to give blood and my blood group was European, but I\u0026#8217ve always lived in Scotland.\u0026#8221Maureen said they were quite well placed as they could visit the classic car shows both north and south of them.\u0026#8220Because people don\u0026#8217t tend to to travel long distance, when you go up Fraserburgh you tend to see a lot different vehicles up there than what you do here and the same when you go down south, you\u0026#8217ll see something different,\u0026#8221 she said.The couple are both preparing for the 13th Tayside Classic Motor Show, which is being held at Errol Airfield on Sunday, June 10, which they have been involved with for the last 12 years.\u0026#8220We\u0026#8217re hoping mother nature will be kind to us this year,\u0026#8221 Maureen said, after the event was called off last year due to rain.The show, which has

He’ll seem like a new signing if he can rediscover the form that helped Hamilton, Hearts and Hibs gain promotion to the top flight.Verdict: Looking good up top.Overall: With just 18 first-team players on the books, work is obviously still to be done but initial signs look promising. Adding solid defenders, however, is vital.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0d1daf5c232.jpg ","title":"va jobs nearly 500 apply for visitor

Market","story":"\u0026nbspINNOVATIVE ideas such as the installation of a mezzanine floor and the creation of more open space could be the key to the transformation of Inverness\u0027 Victorian Market.Since taking up the role of market manager six months ago, Jo Murray has been exploring ways in which the historic site\u0027 future viability can be secured as well as meeting traders and other interested groups regularly.Suggestions, which have now been put forward, include extending opening hours, revamping shop fronts and hosting events as well as taking a radical look at the how the market hall section might be remodelled in a bid to attract local residents to shop at the historic landmark.\"The Victorian Market is very much loved by the local community but the local community doesn\u0026rsquot necessarily use it,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We need to encourage local customers to come in and shop.\"Under the action plan, a proposed programme of work is set be carried out in three phases.The first priority is to refurbish the stonework at the market\u0027 Academy Street entrance and replace the glass door.\"It is a really iconic entrance,\" Mrs Murray said.\"But I think it is recognised the smoked glass which has been installed is a bit of a visual barrier to the market. The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

It will also incorporate the North tower, which has been open to the public as a viewing platform for more than a year and Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.Locals and tourists can also look forward to new galleries which will host national and international exhibitions, displays celebrating the creativity and beauty of the Highlands as well as \"retail and catering\" which showcase the best of what the region has to offer.\u0026nbspA new hotel could also be created as part of the makeover.The project is to be part-funded by \u0026pound1.5 million from the \u0026pound15 million Scottish Government contribution to the Inverness-Highland City-Region Deal.The remainder will involve hefty borrowing by the council although it said it would benefit from the rents of the various businesses in the existing buildings.Speaking at the castle Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing, co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment, said the investment would support economic growth and create a \"sustainable, viable and must-see attraction to celebrate the spirit of the Highlands\".He added: \"It will create a once in a generation opportunity for future redevelopment for the city and the Highlands to create something of high architectural value \u0026ndash precisely the opposite of the existing buildings.\"Equally thrilled council leader Margaret Davidson said: \"This has been a long-held ambition.\"It will help us achieve our vision for this iconic site and Inverness Castle\u0027 place as part of a range of tourism assets this region has to offer.\"Highland planning director Stuart Black confirmed the purchase price was \"over \u0026pound5 million\", adding: \"We\u0026rsquore still in final discussions with the owner but it will be agreed by the end of June and then we\u0026rsquoll release the purchase price.\"He said the options for the site were to renovate, to redevelop partially \u0026ndash perhaps by removing the upper deck \u0026ndash or what he termed \"comprehensive redevelopment\".Project manager Graham Watson, of High Life Highland, said: \"It\u0027 a one-off opportunity for Inverness to really look at how it see its future for Castlehill.\"The attraction envisaged for the castle will promote the Highlands\u0027 \"creativity, wellbeing, culture, heritage and natural environment\".Thursday 7 Jun 2018 4:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04043000/04043681.jpg","title":"Yellow peril told to look the other way","story":"\u0026nbspTRAFFIC wardens have been ordered not to slap fines on motorists in an Inverness\u0026nbspstreet \u0026ndash because the parking signs are invalid and council workers are too busy fixing potholes to find time to take them down.The \"yellow peril\" has been instructed to turn a blind eye on Greig Street until a maintenance team can get round to putting up correct signage.The move has left B\u0026ampB owners scratching their heads wondering how they can convince their guests to ignore the signs and assure them they will not get a ticket.\"Surely the council can do better than that,\" said Acer Glen Guest House owner Stephen Bowsher.\"I can quite believe they\u0026rsquore busy fixing potholes but are they really expecting me to turn around to a guest and say \u0026lsquoI know what the signs say but that\u0027 OK, you can just ignore it?

I am well aware of where I need to make changes and make improvements in the summer.”Forrester was placed on the transfer list at the end of the last campaign by Peterborough boss Steve Evans.The midfielder, who had a year left on his deal, was one of 14 players made available for transfer by the League One outfit.Aberdeen also enquired about Forrester’s Posh team-mate Jack Baldwin but have ended that interest.Bolstering the midfield is the main priority for McInnes this summer after that area was weakened at the end of the campaign.Anthony O’Connor is in talks with an English lower league club.His contract at Pittodrie expired at the end of May and he looks certain to move on. Loan midfielders Ryan Christie (Celtic), Greg Stewart (Birmingham), Dominic Ball (Rotherham) and Chidi Nwakali (Manchester City) have all returned to their parent clubs.Midfielder Greg Tansey, who still has two years left on his Dons deal, has been told he is free to find another club this summer.Tansey spent the second half of the recent season on loan at Ross County.McInnes insists that in Forrester he has landed a player who can feature in a number of midfield roles.He said: “Chris is a player who has always caught my eye.“He can play in a variety of positions.“He handles the ball extremely well and he will bring us flexibility in the midfield area.“We’ve been aware of him for a while and hopefully he sees Aberdeen as an opportunity to give impetus to his career. “I’m delighted to welcome him to the club.”McInnes has also targeted Hibs’ out-of-contract midfielder Dylan McGeouch.Aberdeen have offered McGeouch the opportunity to be the highest-paid player at Pittodrie.However, Hibs have also pitched in with a late offer in a bid to re-sign the midfielder who earned his debut Scotland cap during the recent friendlies in South America.Rangers have joined the race to land McGeouch.English championship sides QPR, Fulham, Blackburn and Brentford are also tracking him and can offer higher wages.Aberdeen have also targeted Ross County right-back Jason Naismith.The 23-year-old is a target for Burton Albion and Plymouth Argyle.Naismith has two years left on his contract with the relegated Staggies and would require a transfer

1st Fraserburgh Boys’ Brigade have so far raised £900 to purchase a Seabin for the town’s harbour.The piece of equipment costs £3,000 and can be submerged to collect waste 24 hours a day using a pump to suck rubbish from the sea surface.The idea came from warrant officer Grant Duthie, who saw the environmentally-friendly piece of equipment advertised online.Officers at the company are delighted with the amount raised so far.Warrant officer in the company section Ryan Clark said: “We wanted to do a fundraiser for something a bit different, hence the choice of the Seabin.“It was originally suggested through our president’s badge boys’ meeting by Grant Duthie, who also volunteers for the local lifeboat crew and it went from there.“It’s now a company section goal to raise the money through various fundraisers, such as coffee mornings, sponsored sports challenges and other events.“Originally, our plan was to raise the money over a couple of years, but with the speed that we’ve raised funds already, we hope to have it done in maybe over a year or so.”Once the Seabin is full it can be emptied and the contents recycled.It can catch everything floating in the water, including plastic bottles, paper and fuel.Fish are not caught because they do not get close enough to the surface to be pulled in.Clean water is then pumped back into the sea, helping to keep pollution levels down.The group, one of three Boys’ Brigade companies in the town, has already approached the harbour with the idea.Marc Thomson, officer in the company section, added that the efforts will count

It’s has been a very, very fast process here.\u0026#8220It’s one of the advantages of the technology we’ve used. I can’t see anything else being quicker.”Vattenfall installation manager Alistair Leighton agrees: “One installation only took two hours and forty minutes and we’ve got vessels that can lay the field very quickly.Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm has embraced all sorts of new technology and some of that was really familiar to people who traditionally work in oil and gas.“There’s so much scope for skills to be transferred from oil and gas to renewable energy in the north-east.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/Murcar-Links-700px.jpg ","title":"all eyes on royal aberdeen for the 123rd amateur championship","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn international field of 288 elite men’s amateur golfers will descend on the North East of Scotland later this month all possessing one aim – to lift The Amateur Championship trophy and with it secure a spot in The 147th Open at Carnoustie in July.Golfers from 38 countries across Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa and the Americas will tee it up at Royal Aberdeen and Murcar Links when The 123rd Amateur Championship takes place there for the first time from 18-23 June 2018.England’s Harry Ellis won the title last year in dramatic fashion, battling back from four holes down with five to play in the 36-hole final at Royal St George’s.As a result of his victory, Ellis played in The Open at Royal Birkdale, took part in the 2018 Masters Tournament and will shortly head to Shinnecock Hills for this year’s US Open.That commitment will prevent Ellis from defending his Amateur title in Aberdeen but an impressive list boasting some of the best in the amateur game are ready to etch their name in history and grasp the career changing opportunities that go to the winner.One player who knows how valuable those opportunities are is 2002 champion Alejandro Larrazabal, who will be competing at Royal Aberdeen as a reinstated amateur.Norway’s Victor Hovland is the highest-ranked player in the field at 5th in the World Amateur Golf RankingTM (WAGRTM).

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus.

This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United. The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

The couple now live in Kilmarnock. “We actually met about 15 years ago when both of us used to go ice skating at the Magnum on a Friday night,” said Kim. The pair lost touch over the years but were reunited six years ago. Kim said: “We started chatting as friends but it became apparent the spark was definitely still there between us and a few months later we moved in together. “It was a whirlwind romance - within a year of meeting we had moved in together, got engaged and had a beautiful baby boy.  “We then had another baby in 2016 and it was then we decided to start planning the wedding.” The couple tied the knot at The Vu in Bathgate on Mother’s Day, March 11 this year. Kim said: “We were a bit panicky about the weather as the week before the wedding was storm Edna and everyone was snowed in. “There was still some snow lying around on the wedding day but the sun was shining. “The wedding day was an emotional day from start to finish it was full of tears and laughter and genuinely was the best day of our lives!” The bride wore a Maggie Sottero ‘Lisette’ dress from Opus Couture in West Kilbride, as well as veil and hair piece. The kilts were from MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick.  The couple’s wedding party consisted of flowergirls - Daughters, Macie O’Donnell and Evie McLauchlan and bride’s sister Molly Miller Page boys were son, Alfie McLauchlan and bride’s brother Jack Miller and the best man was Groom’s brother-in-law, Richard Hunter. Kim continued: “We haven’t managed to get away on a honeymoon yet as we have three children so picking a destination has been quite difficult! “We do plan on going somewhere we just haven’t decided where yet.” KSG Photography captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with beautiful photos to look back on. Claire’s Crystal Brides arranged the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo and Jett Patterson of Allure Hair \u0026amp Beauty, Kilmarnock created the hair and beauty looks for the day. Kim added: “Our cake was made by a friend who is a cake maker, Diane Kay. “We didn’t really have a clue about a cake so we just sent Diane some pictures and trusted her to make us a gorgeous cake and we were not disappointed!  “We had a white three tier cake with silver and diamant\u0026eacute lace trim, it fitted the wedding theme perfectly and was absolutely delicious.” The couple added: “Thanks to all the staff at the Vu for an absolutely amazing day. “Kevin the photographer, Waterfront the band, Winton Weddings for our stunning decor, Susan from Opus Couture for helping me chose my stunning dress and all our friends and family who attended the wedding and made it the most perfect special day! “My best friend, Shelby McAllister for being right by my side for the full day and keeping me calm in the lead up to the wedding. “And last but not least - my Grampa Willie for walking me down the aisle and making all my dreams come true!” For more photos of this week’s Wedding of the Week, pick up your copy of the Ayrshire Post.

The group all started in 1992 and would have all left by 1998. Joint organiser Lynda Hardman said: “We’ve managed to make contact with a lot of them but some are missing. “It’s been 20 years since we left school and I thought a wee reunion would be a good excuse to get together and have a fun night with good food, friends and some old classic 90s tunes.  “We want a night to reconnect and reminisce.” They are also calling on any teachers of the era who could face meeting up with some of their young charges again. They have booked the Marine Hotel on Saturday, July 28 and ex-pupil and DJ Steven James will spin the decks. Lynda added: “Many people have their tickets already, some who live locally like Vicki Cameron, some from a bit further afield, like Ed and Kim Wood (Carmichael) and others are travelling from outside Scotland like Hannah Izod (Green) who now lives in England, Neil Lockie of Florida and John Brisco in Hong Kong.” Tickets costing \u0026pound25 include three-course meal and welcome drink and can be bought at the website marr92 and Lynda and fellow organiser Mhairi Lammie were on the yearbook committee of the time and are seeking photos for a slide show to be sent to atreunion1992@outlook "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12662348.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/lhr_ayp_010618dom.jpg","title":"prestwick tennis superstar learning disability","story":"NewsPrestwick tennis superstar with learning disability climbed Goat Fell for charityDominic Iannotti, who is number one in the world for his tennis category, made it to the top of the 2867ft peak on Arran.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet14:45, 7 JUN 2018NewsDominic Iannotti Prestwick Tennis player (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRising tennis star Dominic Iannotti made a mountain of cash by climbing Goat Fell. The 20-year-old from Prestwick, who is number one in the world for his tennis category, made it to the top of the 2867ft peak on Arran. Dominic was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum, at a young age and is part of the Great Britain Learning Disability tennis team. After three years in the sport, he is number one in the world for his doubles category and number three in the world for singles. He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall. He is currently part of an apprenticeship at Prestwick Tennis Fitness Club and is close to achieving his level three coaching badges that would allow him to coach anywhere in the world. Dominic’s dad, Anthony, who runs the Iannotti Bros cash and carry, could not be more proud of him. The 50-year-old, from Prestwick, said: “Dominic was diagnosed at a young age. We tried all kinds of things but nothing seemed to help. “My wife went online and found children’s charity Bibic and we spoke to them. They were a godsend and they guided us and helped Dominic through a lot.    Since then we haven’t looked back and he has became a fantastic kid.  “You would never know he had this syndrome and that’s credit to the hard work done.” Dominic decided to give something back to the charities that have helped him over the years. He climbed Goat Fell with a group of friends and raised \u0026pound810 for Bibic and South Ayrshire Autistic Society. Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors. We wanted to help Bibic as they were instrumental in helping the way Dominic is today and SAAS helped Dominic from a very young age.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thousands pounds pocketed council after","story":"NewsThousands of pounds pocketed by council after secret VAT grabBut they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston14:18, 6 JUN 2018NewsCouncillor Peter Convery brands move on VAT “sleekit”\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of pounds is being pocketed by a council after a secret VAT grab. But they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure. In February HMRC announced there was to be no VAT on council provided leisure activities. And that will include swimming, gym use and bowling at Northfield. But South Ayrshire Council has not let any of its customers know. If effectively means golf charges have soared 24% on last year, rather than the 2.7% the council have boasted about. It means that golfers paying the \u0026pound429 season ticket price would be expecting a \u0026pound71.50 reduction for VAT.  Tory councillor Peter Convery is blasting the move as “sleekit.” And he said: “Surely people are entitled to get some money paid back to them? “This is about principle and this is sleekit. “This is peoples’ money and should never have been included in the original ticket charge. “It is very unfortunate the council cannot see this to any great extent.” In East Ayrshire, where leisure is provided by an arm’s length trust, VAT is necessary on charges. Details of the VAT grab emerged in an email between a golfer and Councillor Brian McGinley.  The golfer, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I do not think the majority of season ticket holders will be enamoured to discover that a significant element of their season ticket fee is actually related to a cost that SAC no longer have to bear.” Ayr East councillor McGinley said in the email: “I have ascertained that VAT has been included within the price of a season ticket up until February 18 this year. “Following a court ruling against HMRC whereby sports services provided by local authorities are now classed as exempt for VAT purposes, VAT is no longer remitted to HMRC when income is received for season tickets etc.” A council spokesman would not explain why they had not revealed the VAT windfall, if players can expect a refund or whether is was just being used to mask a huge leap in prices.  He would only say: “We work hard to ensure our golf and leisure provision continues to offer great value for local people and visitors and this is reflected in our current charging structure. “The funding from entry fees and season tickets only makes a partial contribution to our overall operating costs – with the remainder coming directly from Council subsidy – and the 2.7% price increase on last year’s fees reflects the Consumer Price Index. “Reducing inequalities within our communities is a key commitment for the Council and we have extended the concessions available under the Access to Leisure card scheme – which includes a 15% discount for all South Ayrshire residents. The change in VAT application for Council leisure services contributes towards the costs of that important scheme, which will help improve health and wellbeing across South Ayrshire, as well as helping reduce the net deficit cost of running Council leisure services, which was almost \u0026pound11 million in 2016/17.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church help build new","story":"NewsTroon church to help build new school for hurricane victimsThe Troon church has raised £170,000 to help transform people’s lives in Haiti.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:28, 7 JUN 2018NewsPastor Richard Woods with Minister Rolex visiting Muirhead Primary (Image: Copyright unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Building a school for hurricane victims was once a dream for Seagate Church.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

held at Hove Lawns yesterday, has been branded a \"shocking experience\" by\u0026nbspguests, with some saying they counted no more than two cheese stalls.  Several social media users said they left the festival feeling cheesed off and are now calling for a full refund.  Charlotte Bliss, from Eastbourne, said: \"The cooked cheese items also amounted to no more than three stalls with huge queues.\u0026nbsp  \"I am appalled that this was allowed to be called a cheese festival.\u0026nbsp  \"I also purchased another ticket at the gate.  \"I will never attend another event like this in Brighton.\"  In an email to the event\u0027s organisers seen by The Argus, another guest, Flora Adam, said: \"I attended the event this afternoon and am extremely disappointed.  \"The event was in no way as advertised and had very little stands compared to what was promised.  \"Only a few hot foot stands (far from the 30-35 advertised) with no raclette cheese or fondue as detailed in your numerous Facebook promotions.  \"Stands were unprepared for the event and after queuing for 45 minutes we were told that halloumi fries were unavailable at about 2.30pm.  \"The gouda stand was running out of cheese as we left at 3pm.  \"Again, nothing as advertised and well overpriced at \u0026pound44 for two people.  \"I believe trading standards in this instance haven\u0027t been met and request a full refund.\"  Facebook groups have even been set up criticising the event, including one titled The Big Cheese Festival was a Load of Rubbish.  Organisers posted the following message on Facebook: \"Firstly, we would like to thank the thousands who attended The Big Cheese Festival today and who congaed their way around the Main Stage Tent, creating that incredible Festival Atmosphere.  \"We would like to express our sympathy toward some of our amazing cheese and cheesey Street Food Traders who were traveling to the city from across the country, and who due to adverse weather conditions and impassable roads, were unfortunately forced to abort their journeys today.  \"Sadly due to this, a few compromises had to be made and we are disappointed that a larger variety of cheese wasn\u0026rsquot available.  \"Despite this, our cheese traders who were able to attend showed amazing dedication throughout the event, and did not fail to deliver, with food available right to the end.  \"We would like to offer everyone who purchased a ticket 50 per cent discount to next years event.  \"All feedback will be taken on board, please email info@thebigcheesefestival.\"  Did you attend the festival?

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message. Let people know what you\u0026rsquove seen and the emotions you\u0026rsquove felt.      \"Millions of children all over the world live in silence.\"    \u0027The Silent Child\u0027 screenwriter and star Rachel Shenton signed her #Oscars acceptance speech for Best Live Action Short Film. https://t.co/t3Dtf4Uy3c pic.twitter/PYB0M7gRNs"},{"url":null,"title":"IN PICS  East Lothian in the sun","story":"              THE sunshine has inspired East Lothian Courier Camera Club members to capture some stunning images this month.

Rockers Altered Sky are fulfilling their ambition of playing at Download Festival, Britain\u0026rsquos premier hard rock and heavy metal festival, on Thursday, June 7, with plans for a UK summer tour also set to be announced in the coming weeks.  The band, which includes Haddington\u0026rsquos Ana Nowosielska and Amy Blair, will be the main support in the Doghouse Tent, with the gig taking place the day before the main festival gets under way.  Ana, the band\u0026rsquos lead singer, was excited \u0026ldquobeyond words ahead of the festival, which is celebrating its 16th year.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is up there with a childhood dream.  \u0026ldquoYou would go to Download and see Slipknot and Metallica and we are going to be playing there as well.  \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely amazing.  The band is looking at hiring a van and staying for the four-day festival at Donington Park, which this year is headlined by Avenged Sevenfold, Guns N\u0026rsquo Roses and Ozzy Osbourne.  Ana added: \u0026ldquoDownload is definitely one of our goals.  \u0026ldquoIt is one of the biggest music festivals in the UK, especially for our type of music.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much suited to where we want to be.  Currently the band\u0026rsquos attention is focused on creating their second album, the follow-up to Without Wonderland.  The five-piece will soon head down to Wales to record the album, with a view to it being released in the New Year.  Ana, 28, said: \u0026ldquoEverything has been a lot easier this time.  \u0026ldquoWe were joking the other day and saying we had a good five years to write the first album and now we have had six months to write the second album.  \u0026ldquoThe difference is we are definitely going to see that the album is going to stand by itself.  The band are then hoping to get back on the open road, with a UK tour being organised and the band keen to venture further afield again.  Last autumn, the band enjoyed a 19-date tour which saw them performing in the Philippines and Japan.  Ana told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously talking about going back to Asia again. We met so many good people and made so many wonderful relationships.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to tour Europe \u0026ndash hit up Germany and we had an Italian tour in the works a year ago which fell through.  \u0026ldquoThen, of course, we would like to get over to the USA.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents.

Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been involved with the annual spectacle for a number of years and attended the second festival back in 1969.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are looking forward to it because it is 50 years.  \u0026ldquoI remember being at the second one and have lots of good memories and just had a lot of fun over the years.  \u0026ldquoIt is not easy pulling a programme together but, once the programme is set, you meet so many different people and it is really good.  \u0026ldquoWe have had some laughs along the way.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.

The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.  New CCTV has been installed throughout the store, while various bottles of alcohol are only accessed through a member of staff opening a locked cabinet.

John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.  But in recent years there have been complaints regarding underage drinking, with about 200 people at the park\u0026rsquos Bullet Hill in 2016.  Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.

Justice Secretary Michael Matheson announced the move in Holyrood, telling MSPs: \u0026ldquoI am determined that the Scottish Government should do what it can to do right by those affected by the dispute.  The UK Government has already ruled out an inquiry into\u0026nbspthe violent confrontations between police and striking miners in Orgreave, South Yorkshire, in 1984.  Mr Matheson said\u0026nbspdoing nothing was not an option for him as he urged new Home Secretary Sajid Javid to follow his example.  Lawyer John Scott QC will lead the inquiry, which will make its recommendations by June next year.  Mr Matheson said: \u0026ldquoThrough this independent review, Scotland will certainly lead the way in ensuring that the experiences of those affected by the dispute in the 1980s are properly recognised.  \u0026ldquoSome of our communities have been blighted by the shadow of that time for too long.

Mr Corbyn said: \u0026ldquoI welcome the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos announcement that there will be an independent review into the actions of the police during the miners\u0026rsquo strike in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe convictions of nearly 500 Scottish miners devastated not only their lives, but those of their families too while also scarring pit communities until this day. This review must establish if these arrests and convictions were unjust and politically motivated.  He went on to state: \u0026ldquoThe UK Government must now listen to campaigners and launch an independent inquiry into the brutal clashes between police and miners during the strike in 1984, not least at Orgreave, where so many questions still need to be answered.  The miners\u0026rsquo strike, which lasted from 1984 to 1985, took place after Mrs Thatcher announced plans to close a number of pits which were deemed \u0026ldquoinefficient.  Mr Matheson said it was was an \u0026ldquoextremely turbulent,\u0026nbspdifficult time for many .  He told MSPs: \u0026ldquoI know from the conversations I have had that, although more than three decades have passed since the\u0026nbspdispute, the scars from the experience still run deep.  \u0026ldquoIn some areas worst affected the sense of having been hurt and wronged remains corrosive and alienating.

Mr Matheson said: \u0026ldquoI made clear at the time that I thought that was the wrong decision \u0026ndash\u0026nbsp wrong, not least, because it seems clear that key elements in the mix, which need to be understood, were the attitudes and perhaps actions of the then UK Government.

It said Liam Coleman has decided to step down after five years at the bank and the completion of its recapitalisation deal last year.  While Mr Coleman has been at Co-op Bank since 2013, he only took the top post in January last year after serving as treasurer, director of its retail and commercial bank and later as deputy CEO.  A successor has yet to be announced, but the bank assured that it was\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquomindful of the need to manage an orderly succession and would keep Mr Coleman on board as it searches for his replacement.  The move comes just months after the bank ushered in new chairman Robert Dench to replace Dennis Holt, in what is shaping up as a clean sweep of its top ranks.  Mr Coleman\u0026rsquos departure comes nearly a year after the Co-op Bank struck a \u0026pound700 million rescue deal that saved it from potential collapse last September.  The refinancing and restructuring package agreed to by the Co-op Bank\u0026rsquos hedge fund investors \u0026ndash which include\u0026nbspSilver Point Capital, GoldenTree, Anchorage Capital, Blue Mountain and Cyrus Capital \u0026ndash\u0026nbspsaw the bank effectively sever its historic relationship with the Co-operative Group and separate itself from the wider mutual\u0026rsquos pension scheme.  It gave the lender the ability to meet regulations on long-term capital requirements, avoid it being wound down and allow it to continue as a stand-alone lender.  Mr Coleman said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoAs a member of the team originally brought in to help turn the Bank around, I feel a great sense of achievement in how much we have collectively delivered both to address the fundamental issues the organisation faced back in 2013 and to reshape the business around our retail customers.  \u0026ldquoThis is a great bank with a strong customer base and distinct brand and the progress made means there is much to build upon.  \u0026ldquoHowever, having successfully completed the recapitalisation process last year, I feel it is now both the right time for me and for the business to look to new leadership for the next stage of the journey.  He assured that in the meantime it remains \u0026ldquovery much business as usual.  Chairman Mr Dench said the priority for the bank\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquonext phase was to rebuild the bank\u0026rsquos competitiveness as a \u0026ldquogenuine alternative for customers.  \u0026ldquoUnder Liam\u0026rsquos tenure the bank is stronger and more resilient on many levels having also completed the outsourcing of our major IT systems to IBM continued to significantly de-risk the balance sheet and substantially reduce our cost base.  \u0026ldquoThe achievements have provided the platform to move forward with our plans to achieve a sustainable and profitable Co-operative Bank.  \u0026ldquoI would like to thank Liam on behalf of the board for his significant contribution."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7554526.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Man left two children screaming for help in searing hot car","story":"              A PRESTONPANS man left two children screaming for help in a searing hot car.

On Tuesday, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Yorkston was in charge of the children when he was taking them to a nearby McDonald\u0027s and stopped off unexpectedly at the lay-by near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane told the court that the two-year-old boy and the six-year-old girl were spotted locked in the car at about 5.30pm.  Mr Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who were very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe six-year-old was shouting: \u0026lsquoHelp, save us.\u0026rsquo  The girl pointed to an opening in the trees and told the passers-by that the man looking after her was down there, the court heard.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, said that Yorkston, of North Grange Avenue, had stopped for a toilet break and his wife had been left \u0026ldquosuitably unimpressed by his actions.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  The solicitor added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0027s and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme.  \u0026ldquoFortunately there was no harm down to the children.  Sheriff Adrian Cottam deferred sentence to next month.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7806713.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"WHO admits mistaking Prestonpans for Preston on official pollution figures","story":"              THE World Health Organisation (WHO) has removed Prestonpans from its list of most polluted communities. . . after confirming that it had confused the East Lothian town with the English city of Preston!  There was widespread concern when the global monitor named Prestonpans as Scotland\u0026rsquos most polluted town in its latest breakdown of pollution figures earlier this month.  The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.  WHO released a similar report two years ago which also named and shamed Prestonpans \u0026ndash yet it was thought then that the reported high pollution levels in the town related to the former Cockenzie Power Station, which had been operational until March 2013.  However, East Lothian Council told the Courier earlier this month that it believed the reading was actually down to a geographical error by WHO, claiming that the organisation had confused Prestonpans with Preston in Lancashire, nearly 200 miles away.  And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.  They said: \u0026ldquoIt is true that there was a mislabel in the datum for Prestonpans, which should have been labelled as Preston.  \u0026ldquoThis error originated in the previous database release when reverse geocoding the coordinates from the EEA (European Economic Area).

Offering golfers the chance to improve their\u0026nbsphandicap whilst taking in the wonderful scenery, you\u0027re\u0026nbspspoiled for choice when choosing where to play. Taking out some of the hard work, here we bring five fantastic golf courses to try out this summer.  Balmore Golf Club  Balmore Golf Club, set in the secluded rolling countryside of East Dunbartonshire\u0026nbspbetween Milngavie and Bishopbriggs, is probably the finest inland Scottish golf course you have yet to play. Central Scotland is blessed with many great courses, but they don\u0027t come any better than Balmore. A bold claim, but the club\u0026nbspare confident that once you play the perfectly manicured 18 holes designed by six-time British Open Champion Harry Vardon, you will agree\u0026nbsp- and be happy to tell others the same.    Founded in 1907, Balmore Golf Club has a proud history, but it has an even brighter future. Significant investments in facilities for the whole family such as a 6-hole Par 3 course with complimentary child membership and an extensive practice facility for keen golfers eager to perfect their game has uniquely positioned the club. It\u0027s a safe, family-friendly environment successfully attracting a new generation of members such as former Celtic and Scotland football star Kris Commons who joined during April\u0027s new member intake:  \"I\u0026rsquove played a lot of great golf courses in Scotland over the years,\" said Kris. \"But I decided to join Balmore Golf Club for two main reasons: the quality of the course itself, plus the stand-out practice facilities which are set up to cater to families. The real clincher was the massive practice area which has two full size greens with bunkers, a six-hole par 3 course, putting green and driving range. My two boys are really keen on golf, so having such an impressive practice facility that they can use to learn and enjoy the game is important. If you haven\u0026rsquot played Balmore yet, then I strongly recommend you give it a try \u0026ndash you won\u0026rsquot be disappointed.    Visit soon to judge for yourself!

The club are proud to be one of the best rated golf courses in the West of Scotland.    The course was set out by the celebrated James Braid for the Duke of Montrose in 1936 on the parkland of the Duke\u0026rsquos estate, so its holes and fairways are framed by majestic trees and magnificent views of the Trossachs. The backdrop promotes tranquillity and a sense of wellbeing even within the most trying of rounds and yet it is only 35 minutes from Glasgow city centre and only a mile from the picturesque village of Drymen. The historic ruins of Buchanan Castle overlook the course and there are many references to the Graham family within the well-appointed clubhouse.  Rob Roy McGregor walked the estate in the past so visitors and members are truly walking in the footsteps of legends.    In more recent times when the irascible Eric Brown was the professional at Buchanan Castle, the Ryder Cup sat proudly on his desk in the pro shop.

It\u0027s a joy to play and most of the time very quiet, allowing the visitor to relish the ups and downs of the fairways and the tussle with undulating greens.

To provide a varied test for the competent golfer, the layout is not just a predictable nine out and nine back. The classic links holes, apart from the 1st, are the 5th, another par four with its fairway like an elephant\u0027s graveyard, the 10th, a clever dogleg par five and the 15th, a \"one shotter\" with real difficulty if the elusive green is missed from the tee. Members can also enjoy complimentary use of the practise and putting areas.    The course ranks highly on a global scale. Golf Digest rated Machrihanish among the top 100 courses in the world in 2018, climbing 30 places to now rank 61st in the world. The club is also rated fourth best value for money within the UK.

Economics expert David Skilling estimated that Scotland\u0026rsquos GDP per capita to be $39,337 (\u0026pound29,282) in 2017 \u0026ndash slightly lower than that of the UK and below that in 13 other comparator countries.  The slowdown in the oil and gas sector has hit GDP growth in Scotland, the report said, while adding that being in the UK \u0026ndash which has \u0026ldquounder-  performed the rest of Europe by a significant margin over the past few years \u0026ndash had also acted as a \u0026ldquodrag on performance.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspScotland\u0027s economy continues to lag behind the rest of the UK, as critics take aim at SNP  The economic adviser looked at the performance of countries including Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Hong Kong and Switzerland, where GDP per capita was measured at $80,591 (\u0026pound60,000), more than double the Scottish figure.  In a new report for the think-tank Reform Scotland, published with the Scottish Policy Foundation, Dr Skilling said:  \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos economic performance has lagged that of other small advanced economies.He added: \u0026ldquoThere is scope to strengthen Scotland\u0026rsquos competitive position using its set of devolved powers through deliberate policy action.  Looking at successful small economies, the report concluded there was \u0026ldquono single specific policy model followed by all.  However, it stressed the importance of having a \u0026ldquodisciplined approach to fiscal policy, along with an \u0026ldquoefficient, competitive business environment that allows for firms to expand.  GDP growth in Scotland has averaged 1.4% since 2000, the report said, putting the country \u0026ldquonear the bottom of the small advanced economies group.  It stated: \u0026ldquoThere has been a consistent gap between Scotland\u0026rsquos GDP growth rates and that of other small advanced economies.  \u0026ldquoThis has led to a steady divergence in Scotland\u0026rsquos per capita income from that of other small advanced economies.  Analysis: Scale of disappointment over UK economy writ large in sterling falls  The report went on: \u0026ldquoPart of Scotland\u0026rsquos recent GDP growth weakness is due to the slowdown in the oil and gas sector (Norway has also suffered).  \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos relatively deep exposure to the rest of the UK, which has under-performed the rest of Europe by a significant margin over the past few years, is also a drag on performance.  Dr Skilling also argued tax rates must remain in line with other small advanced economies - pointing out that in the comparator countries the top rate for personal tax has been reduced from 47% to 44% since 2000.  In Scotland, the top rate of income tax - paid by those earning \u0026pound150,000 a year or more - was increased in the 2018-19 budget, making it higher than in the rest of the UK at 46p.  While spending on research and development can help improve competitiveness, the report said Scotland was \u0026ldquoin the bottom third of the advanced economies group in terms of total R\u0026ampD spending, at 1.5% of GDP in 2016.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspRural businesses could add billions to economy, says report  Reform Scotland director Chris Deerin said: \u0026ldquoThe report is not about nationalism or unionism - it is about how we in Scotland can create the conditions for greater economic growth in order to raise our standard of living and better fund our public services.  \u0026ldquoThe lessons from the paper are clear. To achieve economic success, we must ensure our tax rates are competitive, that we have a high-quality business environment and invest in human capital and innovation.  Dr Skilling looked at largely the same small economies studied in the SNP-commissioned Sustainable Growth Commission report, which examined the economic prospects for an independent Scotland.  Former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, who chaired the commission, said when the report was published recently that it showed \u0026ldquohow Scotland can emulate the best-performing economies and societies in the world.  Alison Moore, director of the Scottish Policy Foundation, said the Reform Scotland/David Skilling paper was \u0026ldquoone of a number that we are currently funding to add to the debate around Scotland\u0026rsquos economy and productivity.  She stated: \u0026ldquoThis paper is a valuable addition to the debate on our economy and we look forward to continuing to support this debate through our ongoing work.  A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos economy is strong, with output per head among the highest in the UK outside London and the south-east. We are also one of the top destinations for inward investment while Scottish productivity has grown faster than the UK\u0026rsquos over the past decade."},{"url":null,"title":"Ken Smith  39 s Diary  His china  Time for change and Took the plunge","story":"              His china  WE asked about telling folk what you do for a living and Peter Warren tells us: \"In the 1960s I worked as an apprentice plater in Fairfield\u0027s shipyard when I met my future wife at the Locarno.

Gordon was also a collector of classic jokes and once told of the young reporter from Glasgow who was flown out by his newspaper to cover the after-effects of a particularly violent earthquake in southern Europe. Getting a bit full of himself he filed a graphic story that opened with the colourful prose: \"God sat on a mountain-top here today, and looked down on a scene of ...\" The reporter got a cable back from his editor in Glasgow declaring: \"Forget earthquake.

The council used to have a Roller for the LP but it was retired after 30 years and donated to the Transport Museum because it kept on breaking down and required very expensive repairs or dodgy repairs such as injecting concrete into the disintegrating bodywork. The then Lord Provost Alex Mosson tried to be positive by explaining: \"True, it sometimes broke down \u0026ndash but Glasgow folk thought that was funny.\u0027\u0027  Incidentally, when The Herald reported that the old Rolls-Royce was being retired a BMW salesman phoned the Lord Provost\u0027s office offering a lease deal on a Beamer.

What I saw there shocked me. Witnessing the colossal and devastating impact of bombs, shells and rockets is nothing new to me as a reporter, but Raqqa was something else.  During my time in the city, I recall one afternoon standing on the bullet-pocked balcony of a flat belonging to a local man called Khalil al-Khalil.  \u0026ldquoLook around you, he insisted with a sweep of his arm, as we gazed out across the surrounding streets.  Everywhere, crumbling shell smashed tower blocks stretched as far as we could see and the charred burnt out carapaces of cars lay in the streets.  \u0026ldquoSo far we have received no help and the outside world seems to have forgotten us, but the people of Raqqa are rich in their character and we will rebuild the city that is our home, of that I\u0026rsquom certain, Mr Khalil told me, his voice exuding the sort of determination that will be needed to undertake the daunting task he suggests.  Today Raqqa is all but unrecognisable even to its citizens, some of whom like Mr al-Khalil have returned from across Syria and beyond to try resurrecting their lives and businesses.  Many cities of course have been destroyed in the wars in Iraq and Syria since 2011, but the destruction is worse in Raqqa than anywhere else. An estimated 11,000 buildings are destroyed or severely damaged, and the remains of countless bodies still lie under its canyons of ruins their stench drifting on the breeze.  While recently accompanying the Civil Defence Unit volunteers tasked with recovering these remains, the team members told me that currently they still had 6,000 open reports of corpses and body parts that needed responding to.  Raqqa was of course the self-proclaimed capital of the Islamic State (IS) group\u0026rsquos caliphate. It was here that the jihadists carried out their grisly repertoire of hangings, beheadings, torture and sexual slavery.  Given that this was their base and hub, the city bore the brunt of air and artillery strikes by the US and its allies including Britain and France. Throughout this military campaign this coalition force consistently claimed that they precisely targeted IS fighters and positions during the five-month siege that destroyed swathes of the city.  But this week a newly released report entitled \u0026ldquoWar of Annihilation,based on an investigation by human rights group, Amnesty International (AI), comprehensively contradicts such assertions, suggesting the coalition\u0026rsquos campaign of bombardment probably breached international humanitarian law and potentially amount to war crimes.  The report, details the loss of civilian life in Raqqa, based on interviews with 112 civilians at the sites of 42 coalition airstrikes, and its conclusions are damning to say the least  \u0026ldquoThe coalition\u0027s claims that its precision air campaign allowed it to bomb IS out of Raqqa while causing very few civilian casualties do not stand up to scrutiny, said Amnesty\u0027s senior crisis response adviser, Donatella Rovera.  \u0026ldquoOn the ground in Raqqa we witnessed a level of destruction comparable to anything we have seen in decades of covering the impact of wars,Ms Rovera added.  In further comments she went on to quote senior US military officer as saying that \u0026ldquomore artillery shells were launched into Raqqa than anywhere since the end of the Vietnam War.  A spokesman for the US-led coalition meanwhile, slammed Amnesty\u0026rsquos report, saying that the rights group never approached the Pentagon about its findings and was out of line for suggesting the coalition has violated international law.  \u0026ldquoThey are literally judging us guilty until proven innocent, that\u0026rsquos a bold rhetorical move by an organisation that fails to check the public record or consult the accused, Col. Thomas Veale told reporters at the Pentagon via a video briefing from Baghdad.  That the battle to liberate Raqqa, Codenamed the Wrath of Euphrates,was a no quarter military campaign is beyond doubt. That much was clear from the outset when then US Secretary of Defence James Mattis announced the acceleration of operations against IS in May 2017.  \u0026ldquoOur intention is that the foreign fighters do not survive the fight to return home to North Africa, to Europe, to America, to Asia, to Africa. We are not going to allow them to do so. We are going to stop them there and take apart the caliphate, Mattis said at the time.  That Raqqa was taken apart in that process is also beyond doubt. According to independent research groups that track American and Russian airstrikes in Syria, US aircraft and artillery bombarded Raqqa with an estimated 20,000 munitions during the five month operation. This is more than was dropped in all of Afghanistan in the whole of 2017.  For now the controversy surrounding the coalition\u0026rsquos actions and Amnesty\u0026rsquos findings is sure to go on. It will be little consolation of course to those Syrians who lost family and loved ones in Raqqa.  But while little can be done for the dead, much can be done for those who survived and right now are struggling to rebuild their lives.  The US-led coalition, Britain included, help wreck the city, but there is precious little evidence that they are willing to take responsibility for putting it back together.  Eight months on the city has no running water or electricity, and there is virtually no help with the dangerous and pressing task of defusing the countless unexploded devices and ordnance around the city that continues to kill and maim civilians.  The volunteer Civil Defence Unit that I accompanied were sometimes scouring the rubble for body parts wearing nothing but thin surgical gloves, while such is the shortages they facethat even the body bags used for their grisly collection are recycled after emptying.  Right now there is humanitarian imperative to help the people of Raqqa. There is one other good reason too why they should not be ignored. For while IS might have been ousted from the city, their cadres still lurk ready and willing to exploit anger and frustration. Wrecking Raqqa was the easy part. Putting peoples lives back together is more difficult. Right now there it not a moment to lose."},{"url":null,"title":"Series of pledges made by Festival as it launches 2018 programme","story":"              THIS year will see the biggest Edinburgh Festival Fringe yet, with more than 3,500 shows, nearly 57,000 performances, and plans for a major revamp of outdoor shows on the Royal Mile.  However, the Fringe, the largest arts festival in the world, is also looking ahead.  The annual jamboree of theatre, dance, comedy, music and more has unveiled a new Blueprint for the next five years of the festival, taking it to 2022, the festival\u0027s 75th anniversary.  READ MORE: Blueprint for the future? Fringe takes on problems it alone cannot solve  The ambitious Blueprint, launched by chief executive Shona McCarthy, lists a series of \"big ambitions\" for the festival, including making it more affordable for artists, a better connection to education, a look at the problem of accommodation in the festival period, increasing its inclusivity, as well finding a new HQ for the Fringe Society, which would be open \"year-round\".  In a section dedicated to keeping the Fringe affordable for artists, it says: \"The moment Edinburgh becomes too expensive for artists is the moment the Fringe ceases to function.\"  The Society, which runs the festival, is currently based in three buildings, including its well-known shop on the High Street, and Ms McCarthy said it is open to either a new building or utilising a new one for a new base in the capital.  Ms McCarthy said that many of the aspirations in the document is also a \"massive call out for help\" to other major bodies in the city, including the city council, to help deliver the changes.  It also pledges to ensure that artists can attend the Fringe permit-free after Brexit, and says it will freeze participation fees until at least 2022.  It promises to \"seek to increase the availability of affordable accommodation.\"  READ MORE: The end of cash in the hat? Fringe to trial contactless payments  The 2018 Fringe will also feature 697 free shows, 260 \"pay what you want\" events, nearly 2000 premieres, and a series of new venues, including a \"bath bus\", a caravan, and a chicken coop, and the Leith Docker\u0027s Club.  This year will see a relaunch of the street events, which are sponsored by Virgin Money, on the High Street and Mound.  There will be on the Royal Mile, the festival said \"spectacular entrance archways\", new showcases on two major stages, and \"hundreds of brightly coloured pigeons\".  \"The street will look and feel different this year, not only in terms of the look, but in terms of our approach,\" Ms McCarthy said.  \"We are not bringing back Fringe Sunday, but there are elements of it, with every Sunday a 1\u0027o\u0027clock comedy showcase.  \"It will be the street performers, the buskers, but also more of a showcase for the wider Fringe as well - you will see the street itself as a venue.\"  The Blueprint says the festival will have a new expert panel of \"diverse advisors to support artists from black, minority ethnic, working class, disabled and LGBT backgrounds.\"  Ms McCarthy added: \"The Fringe Blueprint identifies new approaches to ensure anyone can participate, regardless of their background.  \"From driving down the cost of attendance to engaging young people in the arts and reaching out to underrepresented groups in Edinburgh and further afield, we want the Fringe to be the greatest festival on earth at which to perform, run a venue, develop a career, see shows and discover talent.\"  READ MORE: Blueprint for the future? Fringe takes on problems it alone cannot solve  Well known names with shows this year include Katherine Parkinson, Su Pollard, Craig Hill and Daniel Sloss, Jason Donovan, Esther Rantzen, Maureen Lipman, Julie Hesmondhalgh, former MP Gyles Brandreth, Rory Bremner and Jan Ravens, Reginald D.

This year the annual festival is to experiment with cashless donations to performers on the city\u0027s Royal Mile during the Fringe.  In an age where contactless payments are becoming more common, the Fringe is to run a trial of such payments for performers on their new stages in the centre of the city this August.  The Fringe is currently considering two options for the payments: a standardised amount which people can then tap with their cashcards on some kind of payment device, or a system with a \"degree of flexibility\" so the audience can pay what they want.  The festival also wants to somehow relate the new cashless payment system to the traditional \"passing around of the hat\" that usually follows a live performance on the Royal Mile.  Oliver Davies, the head of marketing at the festival, said: \"The idea this year is to trial in on four of the stages this year, and roll it out more widely after we see what we get back from it.  \"There will be a transactional fee which we are working with the provider to drive down as much as we can, and again its the kind of thing that if we develop the programme, if we can reduce that figure down even further, then brilliant.\"  Money will be collected into one pot, and then given to performers afterwards, he said.  He added: \"We are trying to get a good mix. Because it\u0027s a trial we want to get a variety of different pay points.  \"So we are going to try and mix it across the landscape, on The Mound as well as the High Street, so that will give it the details we need on how to roll it out.\"  This year the Fringe is also introducing a number of Sensory Backpacks, for children and adults on the autism spectrum.  Each backpack contains a fidget toy, earplugs, a photo story describing the street events, a map, and a list of relaxed performances at the Fringe."},{"url":null,"title":"Sturgeon says conference   39 new chapter on independence  39 ","story":"              THIS week\u0026rsquos SNP conference will \u0026ldquomark the start of a new chapter in Scotland\u0026rsquos road to independence, Nicola Sturgeon has predicted.  In the conference programme, the First Minister said that while other parties argued over past grievances, hers was focused on fulfilling the country\u0026rsquos potential.  Around 2000 delegates are expected at the Aberdeen gathering tomorrow and Saturday, with the first item of business the declaration of a new SNP deputy leader.  Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos introduction also endorsed the controversial report of the SNP\u0026rsquos Growth Commission, which has infuriated many on the Left of the Yes movement.  The 354-page document, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said would continue austerity after independence, recommends years of tight public spending to halve Scotland\u0026rsquos deficit and keeping the pound, tying Scotland to UK monetary policy.  There are no plans for a main hall debate on the report, however it is expected to feature in a fringe tomorrow hosted by the Institute of Economic Affairs.  Ms Sturgeon said the report was \u0026ldquopacked full of new ideas for Scotland\u0026rsquos future.  The Scottish Tories called on Ms Sturgeon and deputy First Minister John Swinney to admit the 2013 White Paper on independence had been \u0026ldquomisleading and nonsensical.  Tory MSP Jackson Carlaw said the striking change of tack in the Growth Commission showed the White Paper had been a \u0026ldquowork of fiction.  He said: \u0026ldquo\u0026ldquoWill Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney have the courage to be honest and accept they hoodwinked people? Or are they still too afraid of Alex Salmond to question him?  \u0026ldquoThese are the questions that will follow the SNP leadership as they prepare for their conference this weekend. People will be watching to see if they answer.\"  Labour MSP Jackie Baillie said the SNP was running scared of having a full debate on the Growth Commission at its conference because it had turned out to be a \u0026ldquocuts commission.  She said: \u0026ldquoNicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos new blueprint for separation offers a decade of austerity and tax breaks for the richest and their big corporations.  \u0026ldquoGiven how badly it has gone down with Yes supporters and the public, it is no surprise to see the SNP now running scared of discussing it at its conference.  \u0026ldquoBut while Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP put their fingers in their ears, trade unions, experts and think tanks will continue exposing their cuts commission."},{"url":null,"title":"SSE to pay   1m after sending out inaccurate customer statements","story":"              Big Six energy giant SSE has been ordered to pay \u0026pound1 million for sending out inaccurate and misleading annual statements to 580,000 pre-payment meter customers.  Regulator Ofgem said an investigation found that SSE sent out 1.15 million statements that were inaccurate and misleading\u0026nbspbetween June 2014 and September 2015.  The energy watchdog said that due to an IT\u0026nbspcoding error, these annual statements had incorrect information on the alternative cheaper tariff available to customers and inaccurate estimates of how much they could save annually by switching to them.  Some statements also overestimated the annual savings the customers could make by changing their pre-payment meter to a standard credit meter paying by direct debit, as well as by moving to paperless billing.  Ofgem, which\u0026nbsplaunched the probe last November after\u0026nbspSSE reported the issue,\u0026nbspadded that SSE failed to act quickly to address the errors.  It said: \u0026ldquoThe investigation found that SSE failed to act promptly to put things right, by not identifying the issue at an early stage and by not escalating action to address it or putting in place appropriate remedial actions.  \u0026ldquoThe supplier also failed to put in place arrangements and processes around customer communications that were complete, thorough and fit for purpose.  It said it had decided\u0026nbspnot to take formal enforcement action, in view of SSE\u0026rsquos steps taken since to address the failings, the low level of harm caused to customers and the \u0026pound1 million agreed payment.  Ofgem confirmed that\u0026nbspSSE has since improved its processes to prevent incorrect statements being issued again, including extra checks on customer communications.

Kate Forbes MSP, who is a ministerial aide to Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, said the ongoing crisis around exiting the EU should be used as \u0026ldquoan opportunity to prepare.  But instead, it is \"far easier\" for politicians to simply blame Brexit and the UK Government, she said.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspScotland\u0026rsquos economy \u0027lags other small countries\u0027  Ms Forbes made the comments during an event by the think tank Reform Scotland, which was discussing a new report by economics advisor David Skilling.  Mr Skilling found Scotland\u0026rsquos economy has \u0026ldquolagged behind that of other advanced small nations, with a slowdown in the oil and gas sector hitting GDP growth and the UK acting as a \u0026ldquodrag on performance.  He said an independent Scotland would have to move quickly to cut its deficit, while also warning it would need to \u0026ldquothink hard about the impact of any tax hikes.  Ms Forbes said Scotland\u0026rsquos potential outstrips its performance as a country, and called for cross-party agreement on pushing the economy forward.  But she said \u0026ldquoeasy headlines and impatience often meant the potential to reach across partisan lines was lost.  She told the event: \u0026ldquoThis is where you can tell I\u0026rsquom not currently acting as my party\u0026rsquos spokesperson. It goes back into the first point of the tendency we have to blame and find responsibility.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos so easy. Sometimes I think it would be far easier to be in the opposition, because it\u0026rsquos so much easier to blame.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos far easier for me \u0026ndash and I do it all the time \u0026ndash to stand up and blame Brexit or to blame Westminster or to blame somebody else.  \u0026ldquoBut the truth of the matter is, as the report states, at times of crisis and when we do as a country have exposure to the poor performance of the United Kingdom and our current direction of travel, which is to increase friction when it comes to our borders.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspTrust between Holyrood and Westminster at \u0027lowest ebb in a decade\u0027  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think many people are at odds on the fact that it is a time of crisis. At a time of crisis, we need to use it as an opportunity to prepare. And that\u0026rsquos difficult. It\u0026rsquos immensely difficult.  Yesterday, Mr Mackay reiterated calls for Holyrood to take control of immigration powers in order to boost economic growth.  The Finance Secretary said the UK Government\u0027s target of reducing migration to the tens of thousands was \"unhelpful\" to Scotland, which has an ageing population.  In his report, Mr Skilling looked at the performance of countries including Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Hong Kong and Switzerland, where GDP per capita was measured at \u0026pound60,000 \u0026ndash more than double the Scottish figure.  He said there was \u0026ldquono single specific policy model for a successful small country, but insisted he was generally optimistic about their prospects in the global economy.  However, he argued the intensity of competition was increasing, while the \u0026ldquounusually supportive environment for small, open economies after the Second World War was becoming more challenging under the influence of Donald Trump and China.  Mr Skilling also warned an independent Scotland would need to \u0026ldquothink hard about issues such as income tax.  He said: \u0026ldquoYou need to think hard about the competitive impact in terms of how attractive Scotland is to firms and to people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos no magic tax rate above which you\u0027re in trouble and below which you\u0026rsquore fine, but I do think it\u0026rsquos one of the elements that plays to competitiveness.  \u0026ldquoSo if you\u0026rsquore raising the tax rate \u0026ndash obviously it increases the cost structure, [and]\u0026nbspyou need to have a degree of confidence that you have other things going on that are going to make that feasible and sustainable.

Hundreds of jobs will be lost after Young\u0027s Seafood decided there was no \"viable alternative\" to shutting the Pinneys of Scotland plant in Annan.  Now enterprise minister Paul Wheelhouse urging the firm to \"do right\" and come up with tangible action to lessen the \u0026ldquobitter blow through efforts such as financial contributions to legacy projects.  The company announced last week, after a 45-day consultation period with staff, that it would close the Pinneys processing plant in the town and move the operation to Grimsby.    Mr Wheelhouse said there was \"at least one credible investor\" who had shown an interest in the factory.  And he said in his letter that given the complexity of the negotiations it would be helpful if Young\u0027s would delay its plans to transfer natural salmon production to Grimsby.  Mr Wheelhouse said: \u0026ldquoOur focus is now, therefore, on identifying and supporting any potential new investor to the site. As you know, it appears at least one credible investor has come forward and we are now in dialogue with them on the package of support that could be available from the public sector to help secure their investment in operations from the site.  \u0026ldquoHowever, I understand the determining factor will ultimately be the commercial terms of the deal and I would hope that Young\u0026rsquos Seafood approach any discussions and negotiations in a fair and reasonable manner with the best interests of the workforce and wider community in mind.

As such, I would ask for you to re-assess your current plans to transfer the natural salmon production to your Grimsby site in July and, instead, in parallel, put on hold the next phase of redundancies planned for then.    Mr Wheelhouse added that he hoped to meet the company in the near future to discuss all the issues surrounding the closure.  Unite Scotland industrial officer Andy MacFarlane said the union was \u0026ldquoextremely disappointed by the decision.  He said that although the closure confirmation had not been a surprise it was still a blow to staff. He added: \u0026ldquoThe workforce is devastated.
