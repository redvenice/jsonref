But let’s not dwell on the past, because the future promises yet more excitement. Like many 11-year-olds, the Not the Booker is changing.We still want to find this year’s best novels and uncover a few gems that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. We still want to have a serious discussion about literature and prize culture. We still want to have fun. And we still want to hear from you about the books that matter. So this year’s Not the Booker prize begins like every other, with nominations for this year’s best fiction on this very blog and a public vote to whittle those nominations down to a shortlist.It’s here that the important change comes in. This year the public vote will choose three novels for our shortlist. One other book will be selected by the 2018 judging panel. And – here’s the new bit – inspired by a suggestion below the line from Ongley, we’re enlisting the help of Chester’s award-winning Storyhouse library and the 2019 independent bookseller of the year, Edinburgh’s Golden Hare Books. They’ll each select one novel to complete our shortlist of six.We’ll read those in turn, as always, at the rate of about one a week. I’ll post my thoughts here on the site and – crucially – you’ll be able to post your own opinions about the books below the line. Then there’s the final vote, the judges’ panel and the beautiful moment when we get to bestow an actual  mug on the lucky winner.At this stage, we only need one nomination for each title.

A few weeks earlier local elections saw the party gain hundreds of seats and control of a series of councils in England. The party hovers near the top of the polls. Ms Swinson’s job will be to keep it there.This has been a remarkable turnaround.

What almost finished the Lib Dems off was not just their hand in austerity, but the party’s perceived political irrelevance in the minds of a majority of British voters. If history was any guide, the road back to significance would have been a long one.Yet the first female leader of the Lib Dems will have the wind in her sails – thanks in large part to the party’s implacable opposition to Brexit. One poll suggests the party will capture Brecon and Radnorshire in a byelection, helped by other remain parties standing down. If the alliance was replicated across the country, experts suggest, possibly 150 seats could be won. That of course depends on how Labour calibrates its response to Brexit. The Lib Dems’ strength is that they chose early on to oppose it in stark terms. Not only did this put the party back on the map, it also reminded the public about its traditions the Liberal party was the first political party to declare public support for British membership of what was then the European Economic Community.Whatever the pretensions to be the next prime minister, the new Lib Dem leader will lead just 11 MPs in parliament – making it the fourth force in Westminster party politics. While they lack the parliamentary machinery of the big two parties, the Lib Dems must strive to play a part in moulding the future. This will mean they will have to work out how to be more than just a protest vote against Labour and the Conservatives, at a time when populism is in the ascendancy. Ms Swinson could do worse than follow in the social liberal tradition of Beveridge and Keynes. There is room in UK politics for a party that combines social democratic economics and an uncompromising anti-Brexit message with a strong commitment to constitutional reform, environmentalism and civil liberties.It is true that liberal ideas across Europe are being tested by the politics of fear. But the Lib Dems must find convincing answers to the questions about how societies can manage inequality, champion immigration and defuse nationalism’s incipient threat. So far, apart from the party’s Brexit message, the Lib Dems have largely offered an unadventurous and conservative response to the gravity of the problems afflicting the nation. While the policy message will need to be honed, Ms Swinson will also have to prove that she can be an effective communicator of the Lib Dems’ appeal as a positive choice in British politics.The sterility of our current politics may not last, though it is hard to see how it might end any time soon. What is up for grabs in politics is which party will be at the centre of progressive change in Britain. In terms of its parliamentary weight and policies, Labour has been the most effective vehicle for the fair and just transformation of Britain. For Ms Swinson to change that will require a stable base of voters and an attractive bedrock of principles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b983e3b8becc7992baaf1e01d56df66e8301c6bc/0_80_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=574e7e6a56ecd4bab3495ea3a6e2262f","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of climb","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘climb’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘climb’.Share your photos of what climb means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 24 July at 10am.

(The character got an “exit, pursued by a lapsed contract” off-screen dismissal earlier in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.) Portman isn’t just back for Taika Waititi’s Thor: Love and Thunder, in theaters 5 November 2020, she will appearing as Thor. Not “a female Thor” – Thor. (The origins of this lay in Jason Aaron’s The Mighty Thor comics arc which began in 2014.)This is not to say the upcoming film is all Portman. Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson will be back in their previous roles, hopefully with no one remembering their Men In Black: International debacle. Importantly, a comment Thompson made during the panel that her character Valkyrie will be “looking for her queen” was confirmed later by Marvel’s generalissimo, Kevin Feige, to mean that Valkyrie is the MCU’s long overdue first LGBTQ superhero.Marvel’s late Saturday panel began as a victory lap announcing that Avengers: Endgame had officially outgrossed James Cameron’s Avatar (though why anyone other than a stockholder would care is another story) then laid the groundwork for the next wave: Phase Four.In addition to Thor: Love and Thunder, many expected titles were confirmed. Scarlett Johansson stars opposite Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz and Stranger Things’ David Harbour in the flashback standalone Black Widow, coming 1 May 2020, and Benedict Cumberbatch will return in the very Stan Lee-sounding Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, out 7 May 2021. In between comes two lesser-known properties with great potential. First off, Chloé Zhao, director of breath-taking Cannes drama The Rider, presented her cast for Eternals, releasing 6 November 2020, including Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani and Salma Hayek. Eternals, concerning a group of space deities, was created by “King” Jack Kirby and even devoted comics readers sometimes shrug to say: “Yeah, Eternals is really weird, man.”Additionally, 12 February 2021 was announced as the release date for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. In it, Simu Liu stars as Shang-Chi, a character created in the 1970s as a “master of Kung Fu”. The Farewell star Awkwafina has been cast in an unnamed role, but the biggest revelation was Hong Kong legend Tony Leung as the Mandarin, the Marvel villain that Ben Kingsley’s character was posing as in Iron Man 3. The real Mandarin hasn’t appeared in the MCU yet.Feige also announced plans for streaming shows on the forthcoming Disney+ platform, but that’s gonna be junk.At the end of Marvel’s pep rally, which already had its assembled devotees clutching their albuterol, Feige found time for one more major surprise. Mahershala Ali, of Moonlight and Green Book fame, emerged from the wings, announcing his forthcoming appearance as the vampire hunter Blade. Ali apparently brought the idea of his playing Blade to the company, who quickly agreed. Of course, the actor is already in the wider Marvel Universe, playing Cornell “Cottonmouth” Stokes on the now cancelled Luke Cage series, but something tells me they will figure something out.Wesley Snipes played Blade in a trilogy from the late 1990s and early 2000s, eons before the current wave of superhero mania, and no word was given if he will appear in these new films.While he didn’t have so much as a release date or even title treatment to share, Feige, to thunderous applause, shrieks and huzzahs, uttered the names Black Panther 2, Captain Marvel 2, s of the Galaxy 3 and, most importantly, considering they were previously Fox properties, Fantastic Four and Mutants, meaning the X-Men. This is never going to end.Star Trek booked 90 minutes of Hall H time to try and convince nerds to shell out for the fledgeling CBS All Access streaming service. They may have succeeded. After some talk about Star Trek Discovery’s third season and a look Lower Decks, an animated comedy from Rick and Morty producer Mike McMahan (and the first bit of animated Star Trek in 45 years) they brought out the big phasers.Patrick Stewart was positively beaming as he presented a full trailer for the new series Star Trek: Picard. With the exception of a short montage in the 2009 Star Trek film, this represents the first continuance of the “prime” Trek timeline since the franchise ran out of dilithium crystal with the 2002 dud Star Trek Nemesis.Captain Jean-Luc Picard is living in comfort with a dog (named Number One!) at his vineyard in France when trouble comes looking for him. He must return to Starfleet to confront his most hated of foes: the Borg. With him (and no one saw this coming) is Jeri Ryan, reprising her role as Seven of Nine. Also, sending fans into an orbit of pure bliss, Brent Spiner is back, though we will need to wait and see if he’s playing Data, B4 or some sort of android-of-Theseus combination. (Trekkies know exactly what I am talking about, just trust me.) Though they were not at the panel, it was confirmed that Jonathan Frakes (who also directed a number of episodes) will return as William T Riker and Marina Sirtis will do the same as Deanna Troi.Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ 12-issue collection Watchmen from the mid-1980s remains the go-to title to hand to someone who thinks superhero comics can’t be a worthwhile intellectual pursuit. Zack Snyder adapted it into a middling film in 2009, after other directors such as Terry Gilliam had failed. Maybe not everything should be a movie, many fans suggested. But how about an HBO series?Created by Damon Lindelof (of Lost and The Leftovers fame) this new Watchmen is being called a remix as opposed to an adaptation or sequel. The setting is current and many of the characters are new. Still, the basic premise remains: what if, like, superheroes were real? While that may sound monumentally basic, Watchmen (the comics, at least) is a fantastic and detailed deep e into the social and political implications of vigilantes running around in dopey costumes, some of them with magical powers. The HBO series looks to have nailed the lived-in look of some of the uniforms, like the grimy threads on Rorschach’s mask. Of note: Jeremy Irons, perfectly cast as Adrian Veidt AKA Ozymandias, star of perhaps the greatest single panel in the history of comic books.Speaking of HBO reviving a franchise that had a misfire feature film adaptation in the late aughts: prepare for His Dark Materials.The high fantasy book trilogy, which famously raised the ire of the Catholic church, begat the disappointing Nicole Kidman movie The Golden Compass. However, the breadth of a series and a decade’s worth of special effects development looks to offer the scope necessary for this alternate reality story. The setting is an out-of-time quasi-Britain with a hodgepodge of design elements mixing retro-future airships and Oxbridge-style campuses. At the story’s root is a conspiracy to kidnap children featuring Dafne Keen (X-23 in Logan) as a chosen one, James McAvoy leading some sort of fight, Lin-Manuel Miranda brawling in an old west saloon and a group of helpful spirit animals called daemons that include monkeys, snakes, eagles and an armor-plated polar bear. Excuse me, I must immediately renew the HBO subscription I let lapse after Game of Thrones.They made a Top Gun sequel. On the one hand: ugh. Let the 80s die. On the other hand: Tom Cruise is, weirdly, making great movies right now, be they the Mission: Impossible series or overlooked titles like American Made. Also, now that Russia is America’s bad guy again, we need Cruise up there in the sky, fighting for Democracy, or whatever the hell he was doing in the last one. (I mostly remember beach volleyball.)Anyway, Top Gun: Maverick, is directed by Joseph Kosinski. None of his previous films (Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, Only The Brave) have truly connected with audiences or critics, but they all have a delicious visual flare. Top Gun: Maverick reunites Kosinski with his Only The Brave star Miles Teller, who plays Bradley Bradshaw (really), the son of “Goose” from the last Top Gun. Kelly McGillis is nowhere to be found. After all, she’s actually five years older than Tom Cruise. The love interest this time is Jennifer Connelly, a mere nine years Cruise’s junior, which is something of a progressive win by mainstream Hollywood standards.The Terminator franchise went way off the rails in 2009 with Terminator Salvation and just got further mangled in 2015 with Terminator Genisys. (Remember that one? No, you probably don’t.) Hollywood is giving it one last try, however, by going back to the roots. Deadpool director Tim Miller, under what appears to be close supervision of producer James Cameron, looks to have stripped away a lot of the confusing lore to make a fast, loud action picture with Terminator: Dark Fate, the sixth in the series.Linda Hamilton (who has been out of the series since the second one) is back with a shotgun spitting out lines like “I hunt Terminators!” and “You metal motherfucker!” So Shakespeare it ain’t, but it’s great to see her blowing stuff up while cyborgs turn to liquid chrome. Though he did not appear in the footage (or at the Hall H presentation), Edward Furlong was confirmed as returning to the role of John Connor. Furlong’s career has been a bit below-the-radar of late, primarily due to addiction issues, so it is great news to see Cameron and company helping him get back on his feet. Also in the mix, though his appearance is less of a surprise, the former governor of California, one Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger.Joseph and Anthony Russo held court with a panel of their own this Comic-Con. They deserved it after pulling off the Avengers: Infinity WarEndgame diptych, grossing more money than many medium-sized nations and bringing smiles to audiences around the globe. They have got a lot on their plate in varying stages of development, but one title in particular stood out, at least to the brothers’ fellow Gen X-ers: Battle of the Planets.Battle of the Planets, also called G-Force, was a chopped-up animated series hastily brought to syndicated television in the US in the wake of the original Star Wars. While footage was primarily from the earlier Japanese series Gatchaman (also called Science Ninja Team Gatchaman), the action was toned down and goofy additions were made, like an R2D2 ripoff called called 7-Zark-7 (a trashcan-shaped robot who lived underwater with his robo-dog pal 1-Rover-1.) A group of space-faring rangers with bird fetishes fought evil in brightly colored ships and liked to spin around in pyramid formation. The later sensation Voltron was heavily influenced by all this, and if you are just the right age there’s a good chance you have been somewhat obsessed with this show that no one else seems to remember. Transmute!What the Russos have in mind for the G-Force (a live action film? an animated series?) remains unknown. All we can say is that Anthony Russo even wore a Battle of the Planets T-shirt to Comic-Con, so he means business.Warner Bros, and therefore DC Films, had no presence at Comic-Con this year. While the next Wonder Woman has already been shot, there are a lot of questions still about the rest of that cinematic universe. Making matters worse for the studio is the relentless nagging from some Internet weirdos who won’t let their QAnon-esque fantasies about a stashed director’s cut of the dreadful Justice League movie die.The unproven claim is that its director, Zack Snyder, while grieving the death of his daughter, had his three and a half-hour opus yanked away by an uncaring studio and neutered. (In their defense, the two-hour version that was released is, in fact, awful.) Snyder has effectively encouraged his fans to push for the “Snyder Cut”, and Warner Bros themselves have created a precedent by releasing the “Donner Cut” of Superman II to home video in 2006. What the fans forget is that there are a number of shots with unfinished effects in that version to revive the snipped Justice League footage and make it look like anything other than a green screen workshop would take a fortune that Warner Bros is very unlikely to make that investment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f430589ea9af5655ead075a82ab0abeed24e4f32/0_103_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5d5afdd316ea0e5ebb65351fde0c451","title":"four inspirational days in nova scotia","story":"South London artist and muralist Remi Rough finds visual inspiration in the region’s rocky landscapes, colourful villages and journeys on water … and captures it in a muralI’ll be completely honest the only thing I knew about Nova Scotia before I went was that rapper and hip-hop artist Buck 65 is from there! What I found was a completely charming province, and one that’s very erse, too, with so many different experiences you can have. You’ve got city life in Halifax, then sprawling national parks, and so much of life here is led on or by the water. I came here with the challenge of creating a mural on a building in Halifax, and I found so much inspiration along the way. The result was amazing – I left a little piece of myself on the harbour front.As there are year-round direct flights from London to Halifax and they only take six hours, you can get right into the Halifax swing of things without long transfers or bad jet lag. Spend your first morning walking along its historic harbour front to get a feel for the city. It has great cultural experiences where you can learn more about the region’s past, like the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21, and the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic. The Titanic exhibit at the Maritime Museum is particularly moving – while ship’s survivors went to New York, all who perished came to Halifax, and you can learn about their poignant personal stories here.One of the absolute gems of this region is the quaint, colourful village of Lunenburg, a Unesco world heritage site. Established in 1753 by the Brits, it’s just an hour’s drive from Halifax, and is best known for its beautiful, multicoloured 18th- and 19th-century buildings. There are so many shades, from tomato red, to deep purple and peppermint green ... strolling around and taking it all in is a delight, especially along King St, which has been nicknamed “the Unesco fresco”.Lunenburg is the perfect place to go kayaking. Set off from the bay at Blue Rocks, a spectacular 10-minute drive along the coast from the town of Lunenburg, and paddle through dozens of little channels out to the open sea. There’s plenty of nature around - I saw an osprey, and a huge heron. And I do love that people here spend so much time outdoors – they have everything on their doorstep.Back in Lunenburg, lunch at the Beach Pea Kitchen \u0026amp Bar  – they have some cracking fishcakes. Most restaurants here serve fish and seafood, and it’s all so beautifully fresh. Spend the rest of the day hanging out in town, just walking around and taking in the scenery and the slower pace of life. For dinner, treat yourself to lobster at the Old Fish Factory restaurant, one of the best places in town for it.Kejimkujik national park and national historic site, about an hour from Lunenburg, has got an incredible collection of petroglyphs, stories carved on rocks by the Mi’kmaq, a First Nations people, thousands of years ago. Our guide was great, and told us all about their history, and the people who’d created the carvings. The Mi’kmaw people, for instance, are credited with inventing the ice hockey stick – they are recorded as having played the game as early as the 18th century. Today, October is celebrated as Mi’kmaq history month, and the entire Mi’kmaw Nation celebrates Treaty Day annually on 1 October – the date when the Peace and Friendship treaty of 1752 was signed by the Mi’kmaq of Shubenacadie and the Brits.Peggy’s Cove is the perfect place to stretch your legs on the drive back to Halifax, and take in some amazing views of sea and sky. It’s got a strikingly elegant lighthouse, but what impressed me most were the rocks which covered the whole area – it looked like the moon, a completely alien landscape.Finish the day back in Halifax dining with locals at Edna, which stands for “eat, drink, nourish, always”. It does a mix of fish, meat and veggie dishes, and you eat at communal tables, which is fun.Start your morning with a sail around Halifax harbour on the stunning schooner Bluenose II. It’s a faithful reconstruction of the first Bluenose, a 1920s racing and fishing ship that, unfortunately, sank in 1946. We set off at full sail and got amazing views of Halifax from the water. The captain, Phil, is a great character, with a huge beard!Then it was time to do my mural the space was a stairwell at the back of the Marriott Harbourfront hotel. Normally it would take me around three days to do a piece this size (it’s around 7 x 10 metres) but we only had a day! I used inspiration from all the places I’d seen, so there were lots of muted greens to represent things like moss on the rocks at Peggy’s Cove, and mustard colours for the seaweed at Blue Rocks, then lighter notes like peppermint green for the houses in Lunenburg.For dinner, try the Bicycle Thief, a lovely, laid-back Italian restaurant. The spaghetti with meatballs is massive and delicious!The next day, before I left for the airport, I spent a few more hours finishing the mural. A lot of people helped, like a guy from the crew of the Bluenose II, who’s also a street artist. It felt great to give something to the community I hope they like it! I’d love to come back and spend more time in Nova Scotia – hopefully that’ll happen soon.Inspired to visit?

The crunchy crumbs lend texture, and a crisp fillet of mackerel crowns the dish.This is a feast, and one you can come back to time and again, with or without the mackerel (which should be line-caught to help preserve future populations).If you can find juicy black olives like kalamata with the stones still in, they will transform the recipe.5 tbsp olive oil2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced2 heads fennel, tough outer layer removed, cut into 5mm slices, fronds reserved300g spaghetti½ tsp dried chilli16 black olives, stoned and halved1 ½ tbsp capers4 tbsp vermouth or white wine (optional)Salt and black pepper4 sustainably sourced mackerel (or plaice) fillets 1 handful parsley leaves, roughly choppedLemon wedges, to serveFor the anchovy breadcrumbs3 tbsp olive oil2 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly bashed4 anchovy fillets60g breadcrumbsFirst, make the breadcrumbs. In a frying pan, warm the oil and garlic over a medium-low heat for about three minutes, until the garlic begins to colour and turn wrinkly. Turn the heat up to medium and add the anchovies, squishing them into the pan. Add the breadcrumbs, tossing them in the anchovy oil until they’re nicely coated and beginning to colour – three to four minutes. Once they’re a nice toasty colour, take off the heat and leave to cool in the pan.Put a large frying pan on a medium heat and add three tablespoons of oil. Add the garlic and fennel, and cook gently until they begin to soften – eight to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, put a pan of salted water on to boil and cook the pasta.Once the fennel is soft and the garlic fragrant, add the chilli, olives, capers and vermouth (if using use some pasta water if not). Let it bubble away for a minute or two and reduce to a sauce, season, then take off the heat until the pasta is ready.Once the pasta is al dente, drain, reserving half a cup of the cooking liquid. Transfer the pasta to the pan with the fennel sauce, with a few splashes of its liquid, and put on a very low heat.Put the frying pan on a high heat. After a few minutes, add a tablespoon of oil, season the mackerel fillets well and fry, skin side down first, for two to three minutes on each side, until just done.Stir the parsley and any fennel fronds into the pasta, then transfer to plates. Top each plate with a mackerel fillet, sprinkle over the anchovy breadcrumbs and serve with a wedge of lemon.For a simpler dish, braise some squid slowly in a pan with the fennel, with delicious results. If you’re vegetarian, omit the mackerel and, instead of the anchovy, dry some more black olives in a low oven for an hour, before blitzing with the breadcrumbs.⁃  aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

But while City were hoping their performances would cement their growing popularity in the country, an editorial with the headline “Chinese fans’ love for Man City goes unreciprocated on home soil” on Xinhua’s English language website on Monday appeared to suggest their conduct on the tour had produced the opposite effect.Citing the failure of the squad to engage with local media and supporters, it goes on to accuse City of coming to China only with “desire to win wallets, not hearts and minds”.The article read: “For the Premier League champions, their appearance in China was nothing more than a commercial obligation, and their lack of enthusiasm and the indifferent treatment of their hosts stands in stark contrast to representatives of other clubs.“For Manchester City, they saw their recent success as a reason not to treat Chinese and foreigners with the same respect. Above all, it was an orientalist expectation on display by the Manchester City press relations staff that Chinese media would operate as an extension of their PR department, rather than as serious football journalists.“An attitude of arrogance and the belief that they were the main attraction to the Premier League Asia Trophy was misplaced and stood in direct contrast to the other clubs. Wolves could not do more to engage with fans and even Newcastle, despite arriving under a cloud of off-field negativity, treated China with the utmost respect and dignity. Today those clubs leave China with a new-found respect and new fans Manchester City leave China with neither.”City have refused to comment on the article, although it is understood that they believe it is not representative of the squad’s experiences in China. A few hours after it was published, a story with the headline “Bernardo and De Bruyne amazed by reaction in China” appeared on the club’s website, which detailed some of the off-pitch appearances made by City players, including “a number of open training sessions and supporter signing sessions, with the excitement from local fans clear throughout”.Asked whether the reception had made him proud to play for the club, the Portugal international and player of the season Bernardo Silva said: “It makes us feel like we are doing good work. People like us. And to come here to China and get this support is just amazing, so we’re very happy to be here.”In February, the joint purchase of Sichuan Jiuniu FC was hailed as an exciting new chapter as the third‑tier side became the seventh club to be added to CFG’s portfolio, while the group has also invested heavily in several ventures over the past year including an official baijiu partner – one of China’s most popular liquors – and launching a Fifa online team in the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3fdc569287317ef5b9a5b69a61c4d9bfbaa19b8/0_106_4637_2782/master/4637.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30236b2654bcabedd685bfcdd94dce6a","title":"sean dyche interview alastair campbell","story":"Burnley’s manager may have a gruff exterior but he also has some unexpected views on football players, family and much elseOne of the best things about taking your non‑sports‑fan daughter to interviews with sports stars is that you end up talking about so much more than sport. How else would I have ever seen Jamie Carragher blush as bright red as a Liverpool shirt when Grace asked him if he talked to his daughter about her periods? (No.) Yet also, what joy that it was a man, Maro Itoje, who, after explaining just how far it was permitted to go to hurt your opponent – very far, it sounded like to us – then gave what Grace admitted was as good a definition of feminism as we have heard while recording interviews for our podcast series, Football, Feminism and Everything in Between. “Feminism just means equality and freedom for women,” the England lock forward said.Now we are in Sean Dyche’s home near Northampton, and the first thing thought you have is that if this was David Frost’s old show, Through the Keyhole, you would never guess that a former footballer and current manager lived here. “You won’t find any memorabilia in here,” he says, as he goes about making us a coffee. “No pictures, no old shirts, none of that. I’m not one of those football people who thinks and talks nothing but football. When I’m here, it’s not just my home, it’s the family home.” Neither his wife Jane, nor their daughter Alicia, are that keen on football, though son Max certainly is, and a good player to boot.I have known Dyche for more than six years, ever since he took over at Burnley. I’m not sure I have ever got round to telling him that, not least on the word of Sir Alex Ferguson, I had been recommending Steven Pressley when Eddie Howe headed back to Bournemouth. Two Premier League spells and a Europa League adventure later, there are no doubters now. He has become a good friend, and I have got to see that behind the rough, gruff exterior is a thinking man, of deep values, and an acute football brain.Once we have chatted over his impressions of last season and hopes for next – “guess we’ll just have to keep bringing rabbits out of the hat” – Grace joins us and all of a sudden we are talking about homophobia. Dyche is telling us that if a player told him he was gay, neither he nor anyone else in the dressing room would have any issue with it. “Does being gay mean you can’t be a good footballer?” he would say. “No. So let’s crack on.”So what does it say about the culture of homophobia in football, Grace wants to know, that no current players in the English men’s game have come out as gay? There must be gay footballers, she says – he nods – but we don’t have any idea. “Hold on though,” he says. “Have you ever thought they might not want you to have any idea? This thing about ‘the next gay footballer’. Imagine the noise around that. They might not want it. You could not contain that information. All I am saying is that in my changing room, there would be no problem.”We ask all our interviewees to mark themselves out of 10, both as football fans and as feminists. On feminism, he marks himself down, saying he is probably “around three, four out of 10”, though Grace marks him up as the conversation develops as he talks about his mother, his wife and his teenage daughter in terms which make her think he understands equality, but perhaps doesn’t understand that equality is all feminism is really about. “I grew up in an era where Dad worked, Mum looked after the family, and if I think of the qualities she brought to that – nurture and support are so valuable. She didn’t have a powerful job, but she was very powerful in my house, as powerful as any position anyone can hold in a business. You cannot underestimate the importance of that role in a home.”His wife Jane, he says, is also “what you would call a housewife”, but cultural and social changes mean she does it differently to the last generation. “She doesn’t have a job but she teaches disabled children tennis, and in the last six and a half years I’ve lived two lives, working in Burnley, a lot of time up there, and Jane has been here with the children much more. She has done a remarkable job – I should tell her more. She is her own woman, she is bright, has a degree, but her thirst is not a career but to be the modern version of a housewife, not cooking and cleaning the whole time, but making sure everything here is ticking over and the kids are OK …“It’s all about education. We are more educated. I am still learning. I am in a male-dominated world.”Male-dominated or not, it is a world in which the modern manager must pay attention to the emotional needs of players in a way that makes his time as a player seem like a different age. Though he speaks with fondness bordering on reverence of Brian Clough, manager at Nottingham Forest when Dyche was a young apprentice, he describes his man management as “brutal”. “It was basically ‘do it, or disappear’. If he told you you played well, your head grew so big you couldn’t get through the door. If he said you played badly, you wanted to disappear under the floor. On a horse, with a top hat on.”Today, he says, even if players play really badly, a manager needs to say ‘“you did well there, but here’s how you could have done better”. Clough really did say to players “get your hair cut, young man,” and the players did as they were told. He admits he occasionally suggests to his players they take a trip to the barber. “The idea of asking them to do errands for me, like Cloughie did, forget it. It’s just not happening.”What he did learn from Clough, though, is “the value of simplicity”. He says: “Don’t overcomplicate. I mean, I never made it at Forest, but I was there three years and I saw him a lot, we were in and around the senior players and everyone knew their role, because he kept it simple. The game is a lot bigger, a lot more complicated in some ways, but you still have to try to keep it simple.“Most people think footballers are thick. Some might be, academically, but they can see the game, strategically, tactically, in every way.”Technically, tactically and physically, he feels the modern academy-trained footballer is in a different league to those of his era. Mentally, though, he is not so sure. “Life is really different. The earthiness has gone. Is there the same desire, dedication, drive to achieve? You are not going to be a player without the will and the desire and the belief … People now want the Ferrari and the big house, the kind of thing that never crossed my mind.”He thinks Clough would struggle with a lot in the modern game. Agents. Social media. Tattoos! “It wouldn’t be ‘get your hair cut’ but ‘get rid of your tattoos, young man’.” Dyche is closer to Clough on this than he is to the players. “Everyone has a tattoo, thinking they’re different, but it means they’re all the same.” He mimics a player – “‘Oh, but my sleeve is different!’ – I reckon about five of our players don’t have one. Listen, I’m not anti-tattoo, I just don’t understand it.”But does any of it matter, Grace interjects, provided they play well? “Ah,” he says, “but these things can get confusing. It is not the tattoos. It’s that you can start believing in these things more than the job. The car, the lifestyle, it becomes bigger than the job, it softens you and swerves you off the job, takes the edge away.” Ironically, given that the tattoo-isation of modern football and modern Britain owes as much to David Beckham as anyone else, he cites him as the best example of someone who was able to do all the off-field stuff while remaining at the top of his game on it. “Madness all around him, yet delivering all the time.”In the end, he says, for all the knowledge that data and analytics can give you, managers still have to be able to make human judgments about players. “If there is a flaw in the academy system it’s that they try to tell them everything. Kids are taught the same. They look the same. So you’re constantly looking for the X factor. It’s the hardest thing, that mystical ingredient, instinct, the four-second hit, likedislike, it can come unbelievably quickly. Sometimes I can smell it.”With Dwight McNeil, the teenager who broke into the first team from the youth side last season, he says: “We might show him a few clips, give him a few prompts. But the more he works it out himself the better, far better than me telling him everything. I’m a great believer in self-learning. People have asked what have I done to bring him on. Part of it is leaving him alone. I am still learning about Dwight as a person. He had a knock at 14, he was rejected by Man U. That can be a powerful thing. He stuck at it. That’s a good sign. He listens. That is a good sign. At Burnley we have to have them all on top form. We are not making big statements about how superior we are. The basics have to be there, delivery for the team, not just yourself.”Annoyingly, he disabused Grace of the notion, which I have happily created in my own home, that I am something of a football adviser to him and his No 2 Ian Woan. “Oh my God, this thing about him advising me. I don’t tell him about politics and he doesn’t tell me about football. He’s a fan. He may be a fan who knows more than most, because he knows a lot of people, but he is a fan.”As for his politics, Dyche is a remainer – though he somewhat surprised me in naming Margaret Thatcher in his “six-a-side team to save the world”.“You’re doing this to wind me up now, aren’t you?”“When I was growing up, she was just such a big figure, doing so much, never off the news and I thought my God, that is some woman, in the world as it was then, you must have something special to be doing that job the way you do it.”Fair point, I said to Grace. “Feminist in a way,” she said. “I reckon he is a seven out of 10.”Sean Dyche’s interview for the Football, Feminism and Everything in Between podcast is available now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b86639e5fc31f6ad0f40a858490d06ac1b638229/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0616f794a2cb14c917ffc4faa380d5a 720w","title":"how we met he had a reputation for playing the field he sounded really dodgy","story":"Amanda and Clive had been hearing about each other for about 10 years before they met. “We had mutual friends and I would always hear about Clive doing this or that, Clive on the picket line or Clive cheating on some girl,” she says, and Clive laughs. “Clive had a reputation for not sticking with girlfriends very long and just playing the field, so I wasn’t keen to meet him at all. He sounded really dodgy.”“I would hear wonderful things about you,” he says. “That you’d had lives in London and Barcelona, that you were a journalist and artist, and you sounded like someone I’d like to meet. There were several events I remember going to where people would say: ‘Amanda’s meant to be coming’ and then she never did. I was always a bit disappointed.”Finally, friends got them together over dinner in 1996, although not with the intention of setting them up. “By that time my impression of him was being tall, Germanic-looking, pretty arrogant,” says Amanda. “He wasn’t like I imagined at all. He was a lot quieter and more humble than I expected, and had a wicked sense of humour. That was my strong first impression of him – that he was full of joy, and fun to be around.”For Clive, he says it was a “feeling of shock. The moment I met Amanda I realised I would spend the rest of my life with her.” It wasn’t any one thing, he says, just that: “I’d never experienced anything like that.” Was it as definitive for Amanda? “Oh no, not at all,” she says. “I think he’s probably a bit more romantic than me. It took me about a year to decide that it was quite a serious relationship.”They got together that night – she dropped him at the tube station and they kissed – and when Amanda lost her job and had to rent out her flat she moved in with Clive. They had been together for about a year, so cohabiting happened sooner than they might have liked but, says Amanda, “it turned out to be quite a good thing”.She continues: “The other strange thing that happened was that Clive got nominated for an Oscar. Which was a complete shock. We were living in this semi-derelict flat in Islington. He was signing on I had just lost my job.” It was for the short film Holiday Romance, which Clive had written, and unbeknown to him, the director had submitted. “I was so thrown by it that I forgot to sign on. So I had to go to the office the next day and say: ‘Sorry I forgot – but I’d been nominated for an Oscar,” he says. Their lives became quite glamorous for a few weeks. “I think Amanda thought the rest of our lives was going to be like that,” says Clive and they laugh.Around the same time, they had, says Amanda, “a crucial conversation in a coffee bar”. Amanda was in her mid-30s and wanted children, and wanted to make sure Clive felt the same. If he didn’t, she told him, they would probably have to break up. “I think I went a bit pale and quiet,” says Clive. Amanda says: “But to his credit he said that’s what he wanted, too. For me, that was the turning point.”They now have two children, aged 16 and 18, and the family moved to Sydney in 2006 after Amanda was offered a job there. Their relationship works, says Amanda, mainly because “we have the same sense of humour we don’t let things fester. I’ve never met anyone who I admire as much as Clive. He’s a true egalitarian, and he lives his life along those values. I find that very unusual and admirable, and valuable for our children.”How was Amanda different from all of Clive’s previous girlfriends? “Whether it’s having children, travelling the world or just being at home together,” he says, “everything I do with Amanda feels like a funky adventure. It feels like we’re a team pulling in the same direction, rather than two people negotiating terms and conditions.”Want to share your story?

But how is that possible?Kirsten, 22, knew something strange was happening at about eight weeks into her pregnancy. The classic first trimester symptoms, such as weight gain, food aversions and nausea, were all arriving as expected – but she wasn’t the only one affected.Her partner, Silas, 23, was experiencing similar physical shifts. He started gaining weight and felt repelled by familiar foods. As Kirsten’s morning sickness took hold, he was struck with equally debilitating nausea. “I felt sick every day for weeks,” he says.Initially, Kirsten was sceptical. She worried that Silas’s symptoms were an elaborate joke, or that he was being insensitive. “But, as time went on, I realised he was truly suffering,” she says. “The nausea was the worst of it. He had it much worse than I did. I ended up sharing my morning sickness medication with him so he could get through the day.”Silas’s experience was no freak phenomenon. He had Couvade syndrome, otherwise known as a “sympathy pregnancy”. The mysterious – yet surprisingly common – condition causes pregnant women’s partners to manifest the physical and psychological symptoms of pregnancy. Those with the syndrome report abdominal pain, morning sickness, bloating and lethargy, as well as mood swings, memory loss and depression. In more extreme cases, they can even experience pseudocyesis, in which their stomach swells throughout their partner’s pregnancy, only to begin retracting after the birth.For Kalu, 25, the symptoms were brief, but all-consuming. During the first trimester of his partner’s pregnancy, he struggled with extreme anxiety and nausea. “My stomach was twisting and turning,” he says. “I was throwing up for days. The only thing I could eat were liquids, such as water and fruit smoothies.”It is easy to dismiss these men as simply being melodramatic, especially when you compare Couvade syndrome with the intense physical strain of a real pregnancy. Perhaps that is why there has been so little research into the causes.“I don’t think that people understand the nature of the disorder,” says Dr Arthur Brennan, a senior lecturer in nursing at Kingston University, who has written several research papers on the condition. “It sort of straddles the boundaries between a mental disorder and a physical disorder. It doesn’t fit tidily into one or the other category.”Couvade syndrome may not be limited to heterosexual human couples, although they make up the majority of the reported cases. Dr Bartlomiej Piechowski-Jozwiak, a neurologist at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, says the most severe case of Couvade syndrome he has ever heard of came via a vet: “A woman developed a variant of Couvade syndrome triggered by her dog’s pregnancy: she had all the symptoms of the syndrome, and she knew she was not pregnant.”So what does cause Couvade syndrome? For a long time, it was believed to be purely psychological. Some early explanations, rooted in psychoanalytic theory, suggested that the symptoms were born out of a man’s envy of the woman’s ability to procreate. Others suggested it could be a way of erting attention back to the man, who can feel irrelevant or marginalised during pregnancy.But more recent studies have suggested that Couvade syndrome could be linked to empathy and attachment. Symptoms, it seems, are more prevalent in men with greater investment in their unborn baby, and increased involvement in the pregnancy.This was the case for Mike, 32. The tattoo artist had Couvade syndrome with all three of his partner Amanda’s pregnancies, experiencing morning sickness, pseudocyesis, exhaustion and heightened emotions. He believes it may have been down to the couple’s closeness. “We breathe each other’s air constantly,” he says. “We own a couple of businesses together, we live together, we work together and we have children together, so we’re very close. We also spend a lot of our free time together, too, because we’re friends.”There are potential physical explanations for Couvade syndrome. What we know from the very few studies that have been carried out so far is that men’s hormonal levels shift significantly during the antenatal period. Testosterone tends to diminish, while oestrogen and prolactin rise.“I’d say my oestrogen levels were all over the place when Amanda was pregnant,” says Mike. “I was an emotional wreck.”“My training regime practically stopped because I didn’t feel like I had the urge or energy. I’m quite a testosterone-y bloke: I’m mad on the gym, and I train hard and often. But when Amanda is pregnant, that just stops. My ‘want’ just disappears. I just get emotional and lazy, and eat cake.”“A number of studies have found that testosterone is lower,” Brennan agrees, “whereas prolactin tends to rise. The link, or the apparent trigger, is found in men who had the greatest concern or responsiveness to the unborn baby. Possibly, this could be to do with empathy, but it could be due to anxiety as well.”But for those with Couvade syndrome, it’s not really about finding answers. Instead, the priority is removing the stigma that surrounds the condition, and for it to be acknowledged as a legitimate part of the pregnancy process.“I don’t really think it’s a cause for research,” says Mike. “Obviously, some people may take the piss, or say I’m trying to steal the thunder from Amanda’s pregnancies. And, yeah, they are her pregnancies, but I can’t deny what’s going on.”If anything, he says, the syndrome should be celebrated as a symbol of intimacy between two parents (the couple are now working on a book about how to stay close during pregnancy, which they credit to the experience). “Couvade syndrome taught me to be more compassionate to have more understanding of what it was Amanda was going through – not just physically but mentally,” he says. “Maybe Couvade syndrome will give men more of an understanding of what a woman goes through when she pushes her body to its limits.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59e50977069728d6155d217c88e141aa2501ce0/0_18_4904_2944/master/4904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc1052292384ee91932455652a219d97","title":"has brexit saved the lib dems","story":"The Lib Dems have made an extraordinary comeback in 2019 because of their anti-Brexit stance.

With Mark Field suspended after grabbing an Extinction Rebellion protester by the neck and Alan Duncan having chosen to jump before he was pushed, the Foreign Office is currently running a skeleton staff of junior ministers.It’s also possible that, come Wednesday evening, Boris Johnson will choose to punish Hunt for having the temerity to stand against him in the leadership contest by elbowing him out of a job. At which point the Foreign Office will be staffed by almost no ministers who have any idea what they are doing. Just as well we’re not on the brink of war with Iran, then.But for the time being at least Hunt is still – more or less – foreign secretary and for what could prove to be his last outing on the government frontbenches he was joined by cabinet ministers Amber Rudd, Liam Fox and Penny Mordaunt. He looked suitably grateful but was probably thinking he’d have preferred them to give him that moral support a week or so at one of the Tory leadership debates.Back then Johnson had had Dominic Raab, Iain Duncan Smith and Priti Patel to massage his ego and tell anyone who would listen how marvellous he was, while poor old Jeremy had struggled to get just Steve Brine. An MP who is generally far too nice to lower himself to such insincerity.Hunt was in the Commons to give a statement on the seizure last Friday of the British-owned tanker, Stena Impero, by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. An act that had come as no surprise to anyone after the UK had seized an Iranian tanker in Gibraltar two weeks previously with oil destined for Syria.No surprise to anyone, that is, except for the entire Conservative party, which had fondly imagined that the rest of the world would suspend everything it was doing while it indulged itself with a six-week Boris-inspired onanism spree.Seizing a tanker just wasn’t on, Hunt insisted. And to do so during a Tory leadership contest was completely below the belt. Something only a deeply untrustworthy country would do. But now someone had told him about the tanker he was determined to do something. First, he was going to tell the Iranians that he was very, very cross with them.Next he was happy to report that the Department for Transport had upgraded the security threat level in the strait of Hormuz. Something that might have been done a fortnight ago had Chris Grayling been paying attention. Though that would have required a change of character. Bizarrely there are even rumours Failing Grayling might actually keep his job as transport secretary after all. For the comedy value, if nothing else. In which case, he really will be the gift that keeps on giving. Fingers crossed.After announcing that the UK would be trying to rustle up a taskforce with other EU countries – Britain has only got about two seaworthy ships left in the navy so acting on its own isn’t really an option – in the hope that things quietened down a little, Hunt sat down. Fearing the worst. Which never really came. Instead of the pile-on from Labour and irate Tories about the government dozing off on the job, almost everyone – including shadow junior foreign minister, Fabian Hamilton, who was standing in for Emily Thornberry, who had been knocked off her bike at the weekend – queued up to thank the lord that it had happened on Hunt’s watch rather than when Johnson was still foreign secretary. In which case we’d probably still have no idea a tanker had even been seized.Hunt wasn’t in the mood to look a gift horse in the mouth. He all but admitted the game was up for his leadership ambitions and was happy to accept the accolades showered both on him and Duncan, who was sitting bathed in self-righteousness several rows behind him, with the best of grace. Even allowing himself the odd self-deprecating remark both about being an entrepreneur and the son of a naval officer. The old ones are ... the old ones.A few members of Team Boris got in the odd snarky remark, but by and large they kept themselves in check. Why bother to cause trouble when they had won? Hunt would be history in 48 hours and Johnson would be in charge. Free to dump this wishy-washy alliance with the EU and join the Trump-led US Praetorian Guard. With any luck we’d be at war within weeks. That should take people’s minds off Brexit.

Famous for being the radical outrider to the more staid Vote Leave campaign, which ultimately won official status, Leave.EU has since been dogged by fines, police investigations and questions about its links to Russia.The latest ruling from the EU will still see the organisation lose its identity, however, unless it takes action. Organisations and undertakings must be based in the EU to qualify for the domain, but a new loophole, introduced last week after outcry from EU citizens based in the UK who feared they would lose their digital identity, allows for domain names registered in the name of an inidual to be kept regardless of residency, provided that inidual is an EU citizen.That means that all Leave.EU, or any other British organisation with a .eu domain, needs to do to keep its identity is hire an EU citizen, or find an employee who already qualifies for citizenship, and transfer ownership of the domain name to them.The UK government advice does not go so far as recommending businesses exploit the loophole, however. Instead, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media \u0026amp Sport recommends “that UK registrants continue to prepare for a no-deal scenario” by registering an alternative domain name and forwarding all requests to that new URL."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10cf94ec2f0d9a5deb6d12ea1f01d708bc95a8dc/0_163_5172_3104/master/5172.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29d2a0c929b10f27100f0840d05d6554","title":"wework us brexit european medicines agency","story":"Property company makes deal as a result of European Medicines Agency’s move to AmsterdamA US firm run by two billionaire entrepreneurs is being paid €62m (£55.7m) in “financial inducements” as part of the Brexit-enforced relocation of the European Medicines Agency from London to Amsterdam.WeWork, a $47bn (£37.7bn) property company founded by Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey, secured the cash from British and European taxpayers as part of a deal in which it will sublet the agency’s former headquarters, EU documents reveal.All UK-based EU agencies have had to be relocated to other member states as a result of the UK’s decision to leave the bloc. The Netherlands won the right to host the EMA while Paris secured the European Banking Authority. But before its move to the Netherlands, the EMA failed in its bid to break its 25-year lease with its landlord, the Canary Wharf Group.The EU agency had been facing £500m in costs, including an annual rent of €16m, on 26,000 sq metres (280,000 sq ft) of office space at 30 Churchill Place in Canary Wharf in London that it was unable to use.The subletting deal with WeWork recoups an undisclosed amount of those costs but EU budget documents record that at least €62m has been paid to the US firm in an attempt to make the deal attractive. The sum covers the costs for 2019-20.The EMA’s efforts to sublet the property had faced rising competition in London’s commercial subletting market as a result of businesses reducing their footprint in the capital in the light of the Brexit vote.A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union declined to comment on the costs to the Treasury from the relocation of the London-based agencies.The EU’s budget documents for 2020 suggest that the payment to WeWork will add €6.5m to the forecasted outgoings to be met by the 28 member states.Nine years after co-founding WeWork, Neumann, 40, its chief executive, and 45-year-old McKelvey, as chief culture officer, are reportedly worth $7bn between them. The company leases large office spaces, ides them up and rents them out out in smaller portions to businesses offering perks such as free coffee and beer.Neumann once said the objective of his company was to “to elevate the world’s consciousness”.WeWork, which operates in 27 countries and is preparing for a stock market flotation this year, is second only to the British government as an occupier of London offices, with more than 275,000 sq metres of space in the capital.The EMA is currently in a temporary building in Amsterdam until completion of the construction of its new premises at the end of the year.The agency’s latest management board meeting heard that that the EMA expected at least one in four of its staff to stop working for it by the time of the final move as a result of the relocation.

However, what preceded that had been humiliating as he was twice forced to leave the field through injury.Now 35, the fast bowler has spoken publicly about the experience for the first time and said that, after sustaining a shoulder injury in the days leading up to the match, he should not have played.“I hurt my shoulder a few days before the Test and I wasn’t fully fit going into the game,” Rankin said. “I felt I had to give it a go. It was one of those that I didn’t know how bad it was until I got back home.“In hindsight I shouldn’t have played but when you get an opportunity to play Test cricket it is one you want to take.“It was a tough tour to start with. I made my debut and it was a blur, to be honest. I have still got my shirts and caps.“They will be cherished as that is a big part of where I have been.“It didn’t go to plan for me but that is the way it goes sometimes. That is a long time ago and now I am back playing for Ireland full-time and that is what I am concentrating on.”The four-day match at Lord’s will be Ireland’s first Test against England. “You can’t get much better than that,” Rankin said. “It is a dream come true and it is something I never thought would happen in my playing career.”If, as expected, Rankin realises that dream he will become the first man to play for and against England in a Test match since the Nawab of Pataudi took the field for India at the Oval in 1946 against a team captained by Wally Hammond.Having made his second Test ‘debut’ for Ireland against Pakistan last year Rankin can look back on his time with England, which also included seven one-day and two T20 internationals, with no regrets.“At that stage of my career there were no real opportunities to play Test cricket for Ireland,” said the former Derbyshire and Warwickshire bowler. That has changed now but at that time I wanted to play at the highest level and that was the only way I could do it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f50e0b9b5b1c8067c91406c8ea90ab0b0a024629/151_319_4038_2423/master/4038.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9a7c7661db5c3ed27ad5ef0e6f1132a","title":"danny cipriani left out of england squad","story":"Danny Cipriani seems destined to end his career without having played in a World Cup after he was left out of the 38-member England squad that flew to Italy on Monday for a 12-day training camp.The Gloucester fly-half was voted the Premiership’s player of the season two months ago but his prospects of going to Japan in September appear no better than if he were lining up a penalty from halfway into a stiff wind.Cipriani has won two caps since Eddie Jones took over as head coach at the end of 2015. He was named in a 35-man squad this month but he did not feature in a camp in Bristol last week, ordered to focus on strength and conditioning work along with the Bath pair Anthony Watson and Sam Underhill, both of whom flew to Treviso.Injury was not cited as a factor behind the 31-year old’s latest omission. It was put down to selection with Jones continuing his policy of having two specialist fly-halves, Owen Farrell and George Ford, backed up by Henry Slade and Piers Francis, who started their careers at No 10.One reason Cipriani joined Gloucester from Wasps last season rather than accept offers in France was his dream of playing in a World Cup having been cut from the final squad in 2007 and 2015. Jones did not mention him in a statement released by the Rugby Football Union, merely indicating that the door had not been closed on anyone less than three weeks before the first of England’s three warmup matches.“Selection is absolutely challenging,” Jones said. “We have left some good players doing work at their clubs and they must be ready if called up. Treviso is a hard-yards camp with conditions similar to Tokyo. Team training will be about being adaptable and off the field enjoying each other’s company.”Mike Brown offers Cipriani some hope. The Harlequins full-back has not played for England since the tour to South Africa last year and his last start at No 15 was in February 2018, but after being left out of the original training squad he was named in the 38 along with his club colleague Joe Marler, the prop having edged out Ben Moon who started England’s last Test against Scotland. Jones has included five uncapped players – Joe Marchant, Willi Heinz, Ruaridh McConnochie, Jack Singleton and Lewis Ludlam. Heinz’s elevation means that, with three-cap Ben Spencer also included, there is no experienced backup to Ben Youngs at scrum-half."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b24fa8ee0ab81fc473a96975245cf70c321e292/18_220_3456_2073/master/3456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e80d00656fd2f6a2fb0511784d659dc","title":"government delays decision on whether to restrict huawei 5g","story":"Chinese tech firm’s equipment will continue to be used in UK’s 5G mobile networks for nowHuawei equipment will continue to be used in the UK’s 5G mobile networks for now after the government delayed a decision on whether it should be restricted or banned over concerns that the Chinese government could use it to spy on countries.Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, said the UK had no choice because it is still gauging the impact of US sanctions on Huawei. Wright, unveiling the outcome of the government’s telecoms supply chain review on Monday, said it would not be “sensible, helpful or responsible” to make a final decision about Huawei’s involvement at this time. Vodafone and BT, which owns the EE network, have already launched 5G services using some equipment from Huawei in non-core parts of their networks where there is no security risk.“The government is not yet in a position to decide what involvement Huawei should have in the provision of the UK’s 5G network,” Wright said. “Since the US government’s announcement, we have sought clarity on the extent and implications, but the position is not yet entirely clear. Until it is, we have concluded it would be wrong to make specific decisions in relation to Huawei.”In May the US government added Huawei and 68 affiliate companies to its blacklist of businesses considered a threat to the US’s strategic interests. Under US law, companies are required to request government permission to do business with blacklisted firms. Some firms, however, pulled services immediately. Google withdrew its Android operating system from Huawei smartphones and Intel announced that it would stop delivering chips.In April a leak from a meeting of the UK’s National Security Council, chaired by Theresa May, suggested that an agreement had been reached to block Huawei from core parts of 5G networks – a strategy already being implemented by mobile companies – but allow the technology in non-sensitive areas. The government never officially announced the decision, which cost the defence secretary Gavin Williamson his job after accusations that he was behind the leak, which would have run counter to US pressure for its allies to institute an outright ban.Tom Watson, deputy leader of the Labour party, said that the UK was being “held hostage” by transatlantic geopolitics in the spat between the US and Huawei, and that the delay could result in the UK losing its momentum as one of the world leaders rolling out next-generation 5G services.“The decision we take will be in the best interest of the UK,” Wright said. “We will do so as soon as possible.”The decision on what to do about Huawei will be in the hands of the next prime minister, with Boris Johnson likely to be declared May’s successor when the winner of the Conservative party leadership contest is announced on Tuesday.EE and Vodafone, which both use Huawei equipment, have cancelled launches of 5G Huawei handsets because of US bans on supplying components to the Chinese company.“The future of our digital economy depends on trust in its safety and security,” Wright said. “We need to have the right measures in place to make our telecoms supply chain both safe and secure.”The government’s review said that new legislation would be implemented to “significantly strengthen” cybersecurity in the telecoms industry. He also said that the government would support ersification among equipment suppliers. The market is dominated by Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia.“The lack of ersity across the telecoms supply chain creates the possibility of national dependence on single suppliers, which poses a range of risks to the security and resilience of UK telecoms networks,” Wright said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6170529807a02fb4593c34e0a3f4b99503e48ff/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5939503d6dcb0e5591863215e30e899d","title":"blue hags and spanish booty the legends of mull","story":"Tales of witches and doomed pipers, plus the promise of hidden treasures beneath the waves, fuel a creative spirit on the Isle of Mull that expresses itself through music, art and whiskyVisitors to the Isle of Mull – Scotland’s fourth-biggest island – are mesmerised by its many treasures. Everyone who lives here – be they artists, musicians or whisky makers – lives in symbiosis with their surroundings, feeding off the folklore embedded in the island’s soul.The story of MacKinnon’s Cave, said to be one of the deepest sea caves in the Hebrides, will chill the heart of many a musician. A piper who was walking his dog in the cave came to a sticky end when a female ogre (or fairy, depending on your folklore source) became unimpressed with his performance. The dog survived, but emerged crazed and hairless with fright. Some claim to have seen the doomed bald canine walking along the top of the caves – and if you’re brave enough to go inside, his harrowing howls can apparently be heard whistling in the wind.Then there’s the ancient Lochbuie stone circle: nine granite rocks that sit silently in their own natural amphitheatre, overlooked by the slopes of Ben Buie. Although most visitors find it a place of tranquility, legend has it that the area is haunted.More chilling still is the tale of idyllic Loch Ba, reputed home to Cailleach Bheur, one of Scotland’s most powerful witches. Once every 100 years, before any other creature had awoken, the blue-faced old hag would submerge herself in the water of the loch, and be transformed into an enchanting beauty. The spell was broken by the bark of a dog who had awoken before she’d finished bathing. The witch, also known as the queen of winter, is said to have created the beautiful rolling hills on the isle by striding across the land and dropping rocks from her basket to form her own stepping stones.The sporadic appearance of valuable artefacts in Tobermory Bay, meanwhile, have convinced many that a sunken Spanish ship from 1588 – either the Florencia or the San Juan de Sicilia – lurks beneath the waves. Having fled the Channel in the wake of the Armada’s defeat, it’s thought to have sunk in the bay, taking its rumoured cargo of £300,000 of gold bullion – which would now fetch more than £30m – with it.There are more riches in the bay than Spanish booty, however. In a town built as a fishing port – that has since developed an acclaimed arts scene, with its own gallery and theatre group – one thing you can count on is fresh seafood the many quaint restaurants and pubs serve crustaceans that go from boat to plate in minutes.You could even be lucky enough to see dolphins, whales and basking sharks just off the shore. Golden and white-tailed eagles have also made this picturesque island their home, as have otters and an abundance of other birds and mammals.The island is also home to the famous Tobermory Distillery, established in 1798. One of Scotland’s oldest distilleries (and the only one on the island), it produces single malts with a captivating charm that are expressive by nature and inspired by the bright, Instagram-perfect buildings that line the waterfront.With its kaleidoscope of colour, culture, wildlife, eerie legends and fine local whisky, Mull could be the place for you to conjure up your own story.To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers, visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f237ebad83038a6bad5935f35a776a8028da3c4/0_109_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c109570b99853b96241bb64772302847","title":"send tip off the tourist trail europe twin 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"You might know a hidden-but-wonderful village, town, historic site, landscape or beach.

Now, after starring in a BBC One series that has transferred stateside, a manor house near Halifax has been so inundated with tourists that it is extending its opening hours.Visitor numbers at Shibden Hall in the Calder valley have trebled to 300-400 a day since Gentleman Jack began being broadcast on the US network HBO on 22 April.The Grade II-listed former home of the 18th-century lesbian diarist Anne Lister has attracted visitors from the US.In the UK, six million weekly viewers tuned in to watch the eight-part series in which Suranne Jones played Lister, known for her coded diaries charting the course of her romantic encounters and often described as the “first modern lesbian”.Calderdale council, which owns Shibden Hall, hopes newly extended opening hours will be in effect from 23 August, and will include Friday openings. The council has also teamed up with the show’s costume designer, Tom Pye, to display outfits at Bankfield Museum in Halifax until 26 October – including the top hat worn by Jones in the series.“The impact was immediate, with visitors travelling from as far as the USA to see the historic hall where Anne Lister lived, and the many other great things that Halifax and Calderdale have to offer,” said Susan Press, Calderdale council’s cabinet member for public services and communities.The council held events for local businesses before the series aired to increase their knowledge of Lister, and created a “Gentleman Jack branding toolkit” to help firms “maximise the benefits”, said Press.Gentleman Jack’s 1830s street scenes were filmed in and around Halifax and Bradford, including Wakefield Gate and Wainhouse Tower and the local watering holes the Lord Nelson Inn at Luddenden and the Fleece Inn at Elland.Scenes set in Scotland were filmed in Ripponden, a village near Halifax where Sally Wainwright, Gentleman Jack’s writer, spends half her time. Brought up near the Shibden Hall estate, she also spotlit the Calder valley in the BBC One series Happy Valley and the Bafta-winning Last Tango in Halifax.It isn’t the first time Halifax has been touted as a culture mecca: last year BBC 6 Music named it the “Shoreditch of the north”, thanks to its burgeoning craft beer, music, and artisanal pork pie scene."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2208ea13f5b2e9217254f2f45eacec41a82381c5/0_112_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b39b51efae281acdb2fe9a7ad0ad997","title":"what a state how veep went from clever to crude","story":"After Armando Iannucci’s exit, the Julia Louis-Dreyfus-starring comedy took a turn for the worseIn 2012, with Obama a shoo-in for a second term and the era of concentration camps on American soil safely behind us, the time was ripe for a sitcom about a vain, venal politician with an office in the West Wing. As Veep’s central character, Julia Louis-Dreyfus imbued vice-president Selina Meyer with a convincing mix of charm and barely concealed rage, and the show’s sharp dialogue and keen observations of Washington DC hypocrisy made it a must-watch.It wrung much of its humour from the impotence of the VP position, as in the pilot episode, where Selina’s speech about clean energy is censored by the president so it that won’t alienate any of his benefactors, leaving her with just “Hello … ” and prepositions.It also highlighted the challenges of being a woman in public life, with Selina aware that referencing her gender would lose her political points (as she told her staff: “I can’t identify myself as a woman, people can’t know that”). While Louis-Dreyfus’s performance was the star turn, the entire ensemble was stellar, including Tony Hale as Selina’s “body man” Gary, keeper of secrets and hand wipes and head of staff Amy (Anna Chlumsky), a coiled spring in human form.The show’s incisive writing was no surprise, considering it was created by Armando Iannucci, who had previously skewered Westminster politics in BBC comedy The Thick of It. It was when he left at the end of season four that Veep began its descent. It increasingly favoured innuendos and insults over clever commentary and doubled down on obnoxious characters who were best employed in moderation, such as Patton Oswalt’s political campaignersexual harasser Teddy Sykes and staffer Jonah Ryan (Tim Simons).Plus, the show lost sight of what made its lead character tick. The final season saw Selina – who briefly inherited the presidency in season three before losing it in a general election – fight and manipulate her way back to the Oval Office, and it was miserable to watch. Where previous storylines were rooted in the fact that she often had to compromise her ideals in order to keep her position (such as when she defended the importance of abortion access behind the scenes but spewed mealy-mouthed platitudes on breakfast television), now we saw her sabotage a Tibetan peace treaty, allow China to meddle in American democracy, and set up Gary as the patsy for her charitable foundation’s financial misdemeanours.It made sense that almost 30 years in politics might have made her cynical but it was hard to believe that even a politician whose ambitions were continually thwarted could be so awful. The flash-forward finale made things worse: not only did it kill off Selina but also America’s sweetheart Tom Hanks, a call back to a throwaway season one remark that no one needed to see played out.It cannot be easy to satirise politics in the age of Donald Trump, and perhaps his presidency calls for an approach entirely stripped of subtlety. But it was sad to see one of America’s best comedies become almost as crude as he is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d53f351e76ede9b02205abd9991fea6419c5f2bd/0_194_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20309171889bcdbc361cef81cbb62efb","title":"british troops to join force countering mali militants","story":"Defence minister agrees to help in one of most dangerous missions undertaken by the UN British troops will be deployed in Mali next year to join in the world’s deadliest peacekeeping operation, the Ministry of Defence  has announced.The 250-strong force will provide a long-range reconnaissance capability for the United Nations deployment in the troubled African country which has struggled to decisively counter Islamic militants, armed separatists and traffickers.The deployment is likely to place British troops in combat situations, facing risks of ambushes and roadside bombs in remote and hostile environments.The UN is operating alongside a French-led force that has been fighting Islamic militants in Mali for six years. The mission is known as one of the most dangerous undertaken by the organisation anywhere in the world. More than 170 people deployed by the UN have been killed there between 2013 and February.Penny Mordaunt, the defence minister, said it was right that “in one of the world’s poorest and most fragile regions we support some of world’s most vulnerable people … UK service personnel will work with our partners in the region to help promote peace by combating the threat of violent extremism and protecting human rights in Mali”.Mali, which occupies a key location in the centre of the restive Sahel, was plunged into chaos in 2012 when Tuareg separatists and Islamic extremists joined forces to take control of much of the north of the country. French forces intervened the following year to halt their advance and 4,000 French troops remain there.The UN security council later deployed peacekeepers, which have been targets of a fierce insurgent campaign. A 2015 peace deal signed by Mali’s government and separatist groups failed to end the violence and instability has since spread across the region.More than 200,000 people have been displaced in Mali since the start of 2019 and about 600 killed in a series of militia attacks. Islamic extremists have staged assaults on high-profile targets in the capital, Bamako, and in neighbouring Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast. There is also violence in neighbouring Niger, where four US servicemen were killed in an ambush by Islamic militants in 2017.The UK has about 600 personnel deployed on peacekeeping operations and is the sixth largest contributor to the UN peacekeeping budget."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f280548f98231175f894b9d358a38368bebf2791/40_50_2434_1460/master/2434.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7d3051ad7a2f7ae40f25788dd6bb487","title":"french submarine minerve found 50 years after disappearance","story":"La Minerve, which vanished in 1968 with 52 sailors on board, discovered off ToulonThe French navy has located one of its submarines that disappeared more than 50 years ago with 52 crew on board.La Minerve was discovered on the seabed in the Mediterranean off the port of Toulon.“It’s a success, a relief and a technical feat,” Florence Parly, the defence minister, tweeted. “I am thinking of the families who have waited for so long for this moment.”La Minerve was on a military exercise when it disappeared in January 1968. Repeated searches have failed to find the vessel until now.Under pressure from relatives of crew members, a fresh search was launched at the beginning of this year using the latest hi-tech equipment to map and model tides and currents in the Mediterranean. Data from the time of the accident was also re-examined. This included seismic reports that suggested the submarine probably imploded as it dropped to the bottom of the sea.A senior French naval officer told Agence France-Presse the submarine was discovered by a boat belonging to the private US company Ocean Infinity. It announced it had found La Minerve at a depth of 2,370 metres, 27 miles (45km) from Toulon, which is home to a French naval base.The cause of the accident that led to the submarine sinking in just four minutes has never been established. Families hope the wreckage will provide long-awaited answers.The son of La Minerve’s commander, André Fauve, said it was a moment of “great emotion” for the families of the submariners who perished. “Many people told me they were supporting me during the search because they didn’t want me to feel alone but they didn’t believe it would be found,” Hervé Fauve told Le Monde.François Meunier, whose brother of Marc was a quartermaster on La Minerve, said: “It’s the end of a long wait and many questions.”The submarine, which had reportedly broken into three pieces, was located by Ocean Infinity’s search ship the Seabed Constructor, which arrived off the French coast five days ago. Using underwater drones, it found the wreckage on Sunday, helped by the fact that La Minerve had sunk in an area of low sedimentation. The first three letters of the vessel’s name were clearly visible on one piece of wreckage.Initial reports suggested the submarine may have had rudder problems before sinking. It was engaged in an exercise with a military aircraft when it disappeared at about 7.55am. The alarm was raised when it failed to return to its base the following day. About 20 boats, helicopters, aircraft and even a ing vessel used by the French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau were involved but the search was fruitless.In 2018, the Seabed Constructor found the San Juan submarine that sank in the Atlantic off the coast of Argentina."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4838b130d61913c01544f27ac42aa4dac04f7690/0_1_4800_2881/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef1054014ece5d83e11addec95a2da48","title":"indias chandrayaan 2 moon mission lifts off a week after aborted launch","story":"With first mission to land on lunar south pole, India aims to join club comprising Russia, US and ChinaIndia’s mission to the moon has blasted into space one week after a technical glitch forced scientists to abruptly halt its scheduled launch.Thousands gathered to watch Chandrayaan-2 take off at 2.43pm local time (0913 GMT) on Monday from Satish Dhawan space centre in Sriharikota, north of Chennai. Last Monday, the unmanned mission was aborted 56 minutes from takeoff. The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) blamed a “technical snag”. Indian media later reported that scientists had found a leak while filling helium in the rocket’s cryogenic engine.In a speech after the launch, Kailasavaoo Sivan, chairman of Isro, said the agency’s staff had worked tirelessly to fix the fault and had “bounced back with flying colours”.“It is the beginning of a historical journey of India towards the moon, and to land at a place near the south pole to carry out scientific experiments to explore the unexplored,” said Sivan.Scientists in the control room applauded as the spacecraft launched into space. It will spend 23 days in the Earth’s orbit, before beginning a series of manoeuvres that will take it into lunar orbit.With India poised to become the world’s fifth-largest economy, Narendra Modi’s ardently nationalist government is eager to show off the country’s prowess in security and technology.It was, he added, a “fully indigenous” project, using Indian technology.Chandrayaan-2 aims to become the first mission to conduct a surface landing on the lunar south pole region, where it will collect crucial information about the moon’s composition. It would be India’s first surface landing on the moon – a feat previously achieved by only Russia, the US and China.The $141m (£113m) mission is a “demonstration of the growing sophistication of India’s space power”, said Dr Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, head of the nuclear and space policy initiative at the Observer Research Foundation thinktank in Delhi.India launched its first lunar probe in 2008, and guided a spacecraft into orbit around Mars in 2014. Its space programmes are famously thrifty, and its Mars mission, Modi has joked, had a smaller budget than that of the film Gravity.India’s achievements in space have been hailed by Modi as a mark of the country’s rising ambition as a global power. In March, he announced that the country had successfully shot down one of its own satellites with a missile. Though celebrated by Modi as a breakthrough for India’s national security, the missile test was criticised by Nasa for creating hundreds of pieces of orbital debris and threatening astronauts onboard the International Space Station (ISS).The launch of Chandrayaan-2 follows the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, and comes amid renewed interest in returning to the moon among states and private industry. In January China landed the Chang’e 4 spacecraft on the previously unexplored far side of the moon, while in April the Israeli spacecraft Beresheet, the first privately funded mission to the moon, crashed after an apparent engine failure. Donald Trump has also said he wants to put astronauts back on the moon by 2024.Chandrayaan-2 – Sanskrit for “moon craft” – is India’s most ambitious space mission yet. Its first lunar mission, Chandrayaan-1, helped to confirm the presence of water on the moon, but did so without landing on the lunar surface. Sivan said carrying out a soft landing would be “15 terrifying minutes”.At the forefront of the Chandrayaan-2 mission are two women. Its project director, Muthayya Vanitha, an electronics system engineer, was named by the science journal Nature as one of five scientists to watch in 2019. It is also being navigated by Ritu Karidhal, who helped to lead India’s Mars mission in 2014. It will take more than six weeks to travel about 238,600 miles (384,000km) to the moon. The four-tonne spacecraft has a lunar orbiter, a lander named Vikram after the founder of Isro, and a rover. The rover, named Pragyan, which means “wisdom” in Sanskrit, will spend two weeks traversing the moon’s surface. The six-wheeled vehicle, which will be deployed in early September, will collect crucial information about the mineral and chemical composition of the lunar surface, and search for water.The lunar south pole is interesting to scientists because they believe water may be present on its vast shadowed areas.

The past four months have taken an especially brutal toll across much of the province with the Russian-led bombing decimating civilian infrastructure.Hospitals, market places, schools and centres for the displaced have been systematically targeted in towns and cities that remain in opposition hands. UN agencies and NGOs say at least two dozen hospitals and medical clinics have been destroyed by airstrikes, some hit multiple times until treating patients became impossible.More than 3 million people are now crammed into Idlib province, many of them having fled fighting elsewhere in the country. Among them are extremist fighters and jihadists who have subverted the anti-Assad insurgency and lorded over civilian populations. The presence of jihadists has been used as a pretext by Russian and Syrian forces for the scale of the bombing in Idlib.An air campaign, launched on 29 April, was supposed to have been in support of a ground war in southern Idlib, led by the Syrian Army. However, since the offensive began, regime forces have made little progress, even with total air superiority.The stagnant battle lines have reportedly led to frustration in Moscow, whose support for the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, has remained resolute for the past five years, but has been tested as regime loyalists have failed to seize ground.The fate of Idlib is central to the outcome of the war, which had killed more than 500,000 people when monitoring groups stopped counting three years ago. Since then, a fight that started as a push to oust Assad has morphed into multiple conflicts, led to the displacement of more than half the country’s population, who now have nowhere left to run, and drawn in neighbouring and regional states, who all want to shape the war’s aftermath in their interests.Turkey, a significant backer of opposition groups in Idlib since the outbreak of anti-government clashes in mid-2011, has proposed a summit with Assad’s two main backers, Russia and Iran, in another attempt to douse the violence. Numerous multilateral peace initiatives have failed over recent years as one of modern history’s most intractable conflicts continued to ravage Syria and destabilise the region and beyond.Ankara’s interests have increasingly been defined by its fears of Kurdish groups in northern Syria, which are allied to Kurds fighting an insurgency in south-eastern Turkey. A Turkish military operation in the town of Afrin early last year pushed Kurdish groups away from the border and Ankara now eyes the town of Tel Rifaat, where a significant Kurdish presence is seen as an obstacle to its ambitions of safeguarding several hundred miles of its border with Syria.Splintered throughout much of the war and abandoned more recently by regional patrons, including Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, opposition groups can no longer win the war. Assad, though nominally in a winning position, owes his ascendancy to Moscow and Tehran, both of whom have been staking out their claims on postwar Syria as the war has slowly wound down.Iran, which provided proxy ground forces that were instrumental in the recapture of Aleppo in late 2016, has not committed substantial forces to the Idlib front, and is increasingly at odds with Moscow over how to deal with the province.Turkey, while acquiescing to a limited Russian-led operation in the south of Idlib province, has insisted it would not shoulder the burden of a massive inflow of refugees in the event of a coordinated ground push. Its calls for a fresh summit add weight to assessments in the region and Europe that the battlefront has reached a stalemate.“We say to Assad and his friends that their obvious attempts to obliterate civilian life have failed this far and will fail again,” said a senior Turkish official. “They have lost in Idlib, and will continue to lose. They cannot bomb their way into victory. Only infamy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afd86b9e1e8d9b36daceca42e3669dad4c812e09/0_126_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7023a858b1295b29b9257470a9b26a27","title":"uk must look after its own ships in the gulf says pompeo","story":"US secretary of state’s comment reflects tensions with UK over Iran nuclear dealThe UK must be responsible for the safety of its own ships in the Gulf, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has said.His remarks reflect unresolved tensions between Britain and the US over Donald Trump’s plans for a US-led military convoy to protect international shipping operating off the Iranian coast.Speaking on Fox News, Pompeo said: “The responsibility in the first instance falls to the United Kingdom to take care of their ships. The US has a responsibility to do its part.” British ministers discussed the issue at a Cobra emergency meeting that largely focused on how to respond to the Iranian capture on Friday of the British-flagged Stena Impero. The ship, crewed largely by Indian nationals, is being held in the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. All crew members are in good health and still onboard, the Iran embassy in India said on Monday.The detention comes at a time of high tension in the region, with US, British and Iranian forces facing off at sea.The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, spoke to his German and French counterparts on Sunday to urge them to recognise the need to internationalise the maritime security operation in the Gulf. A multinational task force already exists, and it is not clear what the US believes its proposed Operation Sentinel will add.A spokesman for the prime minister, Theresa May, said: “We already work closely with international partners to ensure a co-ordinated effort to defend freedom of navigation … The high volume of ships moving through the Strait of Hormuz – up to 30 ships covering more than 100 nautical miles – makes it impossible to escort vessels inidually”.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast \u0027were subjected to sabotage operations\u0027.Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.Saudi Arabia blames Iran for the drone attack on its pipeline.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It\u0027s not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: \u0027If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!\u0027Senior Pentagon officer Vice-admiral Michael Gilday says the US has a high degree of confidence that Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards were responsible for the explosions on the four tankers in the Gulf of Oman.Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom\u0027s south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift. 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US \u0027spy\u0027 drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDonald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats \u0027attempted to impede\u0027 a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.In a major escalation, Iran seizes the Stena Impero, a British-flagged tanker, off its coast. Iranian officials later make it clear that the capture was in retaliation for the capture of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 earlier in July.About a fifth of the world’s oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz, the busiest shipping lane in the world for crude tankers, and it is less than 25 miles (40km) wide at its narrowest point. Tensions in the Gulf had already affected oil trading, and Friday’s tanker seizures caused prices to rise.Britain has concerns that a US-led maritime security operation may have a different emphasis since Trump wants Europeans to join the US in pulling out of the nuclear deal signed in 2015.The UK has already advised all British-flagged ships not to enter the Strait of Hormuz until the crisis is resolved. There are eight British-flagged ships in the region at present.In a statement to MPs on Monday, Hunt will vigorously defend the British decision to seize an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar on 4 July, insisting Britain – in co-operation with the US – had established that the ship entered British waters and was bound for Syria in breach of EU sanctions.Iran says it is not party to EU sanctions on Syria, and points out that no ship previously heading for Syria has been impounded in this way. Iran claims the UK has in effect ended up supporting the US efforts to impose an Iranian oil export ban, a measure that the UK formally opposes as a supporter of the 2015 nuclear deal.The UK Foreign Office is aware that the advent of the pro-US Boris Johnson as prime minister may see a change in UK policy towards the deal, or at least to the idea of a US-led maritime security convoy, but at present diplomats remain committed to the long-established European policy of protecting the deal.There is an urgency about the security of British ships, since one option is for British-flagged ships to be reflagged to avoid them becoming a target of the Iranians, something that would deal a blow to the British shipping industry.There are about 4,500 ships registered with Britain or its overseas territories.The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst \u0027chokepoint\u0027In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.Lord Lamont, the former chancellor, and head of the British-Iranian chamber of commerce, said Britain must resist the temptation to get drawn closer to the US. “More armed escorts are not going to solve the situation,” he said. “The risk of a loss of life is very high and then you will get a proper shooting war.” The Iranians will have seen the capture of the Stena as offsetting the interdiction of the Iranian tanker, he added.Pompeo also dismissed Iran’s announcement that it had captured 17 spies working for the US Central Intelligence Agency and sentenced some to death.Iran made the announcement in state media, saying the alleged spies had been arrested in the 12 months to March 2019. Such announcements are not unusual in Iran, but the timing has raised concerns that Tehran is hardening its position in its standoff with western powers. “The Iranian regime has a long history of lying ... I would take with a significant grain of salt any Iranian assertion about actions that they’ve taken,” Pompeo said. Donald Trump likewise tweeted that the Iranian claim was “totally false”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14d5232b87e7c6408d8c35352df6caa571d0528d/220_0_5115_3070/master/5115.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83e7b3df3d02d50c6d853b58dbfb2a5a","title":"uk to seek european maritime mission to counter irans piracy","story":"Jeremy Hunt says UK will not join US plans as it supports 2015 nuclear dealThe British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has proposed a European-led maritime protection force in the Gulf – spurning separate American plans for a US-led force to protect commercial shipping from Iranian interference.Speaking to MPs, Hunt said the maritime security force would protect crew and cargo from what he described as “wholly illegal acts of state piracy by Iran”.The proposal has parallels with existing international maritime forces operating in the Gulf as well as EU anti-piracy force operating off the east coast of Africa. However, these missions are protecting shipping largely from non-state actors.Hunt stressed the UK did not want to join the American campaign of maximum economic pressure since the UK, unlike the US, remained supporters of the Iran nuclear deal signed in 2015. The UK Foreign Office clearly fears a US-led force operating through the strait of Hormuz would be seen as escalatory by Iran and possibly increase the chances of further flashpoints.In a sign of how the operation has been scrambled together in the past 48 hours, Hunt said he would be speaking to his European allies and others later in the week to discuss how the operation might work.Hunt admitted the US had first requested the UK to contribute to a US-led maritime protection force on 24 June, leading to a formal request on 30 June.He said the US plan was helpful and it was important to coordinate, but said he wanted the contribution to the proposed naval protection force to be as broad as possible, implying a number of European countries would not be willing to contribute assets if the force was US-led.There were signs that his decision, a big geo-strategic call in favour of Europe’s continued support for the nuclear deal, may not prove popular with Atlanticist supporters of the expected incoming prime minister, Boris Johnson. Hunt and Johnson have been vying for the prime-ministership in a contest set to end on Tuesday.Michael Fallon, the former defence secretary, tipped by some to become Johnson’s foreign secretary, challenged Hunt to declare that it would not make sense for the US to be excluded from the proposed force if they wished to join. After he spoke, another Johnson supporter, Iain Duncan Smith, was picked up on the Commons microphone muttering under his breath that the Americans “are the only ones that have got any assets”.Hunt conceded some ground. “We would not ... seek to exclude the American navy because they have a vital role for example in the refuelling of our own ships, the communication system, the command and control system, and indeed intelligence support. So we would always operate in partnership.”Explaining his decision, cleared at a Cobra meeting chaired earlier in the day by Theresa May, Hunt said: “Because freedom of navigation is a vital interest of every nation, we will now seek to put together a European-led maritime protection mission to support safe passage of both crew and cargo in this vital region. We have had constructive discussions with a number of countries in the last 48 hours and will discuss later this week the best way to complement this with recent US proposals in this area.“The new force will be focused on free navigation, bearing in mind that one-fifth of the world’s oil, a quarter of its liquefied natural gas – and trade worth half a trillion dollars – pass through the strait of Hormuz every year. It will not be part of the US maximum pressure policy on Iran because we remain committed to preserving the Iran nuclear agreement.”In the meantime, he said the UK had despatched HMS Duncan, a Type 45 destroyer, that was due to reach the area by 29 July.He had asked “all British-flagged ships to give us notice of any intention to pass through the strait of Hormuz to enable us to offer the best protection we can. We will then advise them as to the safest way to transit, which may involve travelling in a convoy”.Hunt said the UK was also “strengthening measures to protect ships flying the flags of other countries but which have British crew on board”.Given the number of UK-flagged ships, he said it is not possible for the Royal Navy to provide escorts for every single ship or indeed eliminate all risks of piracy, but the risks could be substantially reduced if commercial shipping companies cooperated fully with UK government advice, he said.In a sign of how widely the UK has consulted on the proposals so far, Hunt disclosed he had spoken to the foreign ministers in Germany, France, Finland, Sweden and Denmark.He also spoke to the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who – probably aware of the UK decision – had earlier told Fox News that it was primarily the UK’s responsibility to look after its own shipping in the Gulf.Bob Sanguinetti, the chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping, expressed concern about the timescale, saying: “While the European maritime mission is a step in the right direction, it is imperative that the UK government continues to protect the interests of British-flagged ships in the Gulf while the mission is assembled. This means formulating a mechanism that will provide confidence and security to allow ships to pass through the straits safely and securely.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Three members of public took 20 minutes to swim back to shore at PortmarnockCork native (37) is facing deportation from US where he is married and has childrenJudge rules against fund\u0026rsquos court bid to set aside cert protecting Ronan Ryan from debtsRemainder of the week is forecast to be cooler and more unsettledDepartment \u0026lsquomore than happy to fund anything\u0026rsquo, says RossThe Amerigo Vespucci is the oldest ship in Italian navy and is used for training cadetsBaby died within hours of attempted vacuum delivery, inquest hearsPostmortem concluded man died from severe skull damage consistent with incidentCandidate with \u0026lsquoquestionably racist language\u0026rsquo would not meet with stringent checksConduct by nurse with Irish address while working in Australia found to be \u0026lsquodisgraceful\u0026rsquoResearch should act as a \u0026lsquostark warning\u0026rsquo of hidden hazard that may impact millions\u0026lsquoThere might be a long road ahead, but there\u0026rsquos a road ahead,\u0026rsquo TD says of former taoiseachAppeal court\u0026rsquos decision based on reports about whether accused was fit to stand trialWhirlpool issued warning includes Indesit, Hotpoint, Creda, Swan productsFilming arose from dispute between family members over quality of nursing home careTeenage victim later gave birth to child that DNA tests found was fathered by accused (37)Dublin teenager accused of stealing mother\u0026rsquos car remanded on continuing bailT\u0026aacutenaiste says British government will focus on getting Stormont back up and runningMan in his 70s transferred to Beaumont and treated for head injury after being hit by car"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3964063.1563819411!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"shane lowry s victory the biggest thing to happen to offaly ever","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEsker Hills Golf Club in Tullamore, Co Offaly, where Shane Lowry learned his trade. Photograph: Tommy DicksonInphoMonday afternoon would not usually be a peak time around a golf club, but Esker Hills in Co Offaly was bustling with buoyant members and visiting golf fanatics taking in the course.Players paused before teeing off to discuss the “unbelievable achievement” of the club’s best known member Shane Lowry in winning his first Major, the Open Championship, at Portrush in Co Antrim on Sunday.The local man’s success was the only topic of conversation inside the clubhouse too, where some of those gathered were a little shaken by the celebrations of the night before.Esker Hills director Donal Molloy said Lowry demonstrated talent far beyond his years when he joined the club as a teenager, having earlier excelled playing pitch and putt.“The whispers around the club were that this fellow was exceptional,” he said.He remembers Lowry spending much of his spare time on the greens as a youngster, practising with the concentration and determination one might expect from a professional.“He wouldn’t just come in and play 18 holes. When he completed it once he would come in, refuel, and go back out,” Molloy said, adding that Lowry would put in hours at a time figuring out how best to escape from the bunkers.Aislinn Hackett, who taught Lowry when he was in senior infants at St Francis Boys’ National School in Clara, said he was always “an outdoor kid with sports in his genes”.“He was very bright but very mischievous,” she said, recalling the twinkle in his eye and his big head of curly hair.“If there was craic going he was in the middle of it. He would always be the one laughing, and would never be in bad form.”While the celebrations were taking place at Esker Hills, the man of the moment was still making his way back from Portrush, taking the scenic route via Dublin. He was spotted celebrating with the Claret Jug trophy in the Boar’s Head pub on Capel Street and is due to speak to the media in Dublin on Tuesday.\u0026nbspClara GAA will play host to Lowry’s homecoming event on Tuesday evening at 6pm.Despite his fun-loving attitude, Lowry always did his homework and Hackett attributed this to his strict, but brilliant mother, Bridget Lowry.She remembers Shane joining the club at the age of 13 or 14 and other members taking notice of the potential to be a future champion golfer.“He was a brilliant golfer from the start. People said, ‘God he is going to be a star,’” she said.‘Privilege’Paul Rabbette, the men’s captain at Esker Hills, recalled Lowry breaking the club’s course record with a six-under-par score of 65 as an 18-year-old.“It was a privilege playing with him when he managed that,”he said.More than a decade later the record has not been beaten, even by Lowry himself, who played at the course as recently as last Christmas.“It is hard to put into words the amount of pride that we feel today,” said Rabbette, who travelled to Portrush to see Lowry close out his victory.While Co Offaly has had some success in the hurling and football championships, Rabbette feels Lowry’s win knocks those past achievements out of the park. “This is the biggest thing to happen to Offaly ever.”Kris Ahers (45) was among a group of Australian golfers who detoured to Esker Hills while en route from Portmarnock to Killarney.“Our driver suggested we take a detour for lunch at the club so we thought it would be great to get a tour,” he said, adding that most of the group were “golf fanatics”. Fresh off a spin around the course in a golf buggy, Ahers said it was “great to see” where the champion golfer’s career began.After celebrating late into the night in Portrush, club member Gerry Buckley (45) rearranged his working day to bask in the “once in a lifetime” glory of Lowry’s win.“This will never happen like this again,” he said. “Even if he wins another one, it will not be like the first time.”Buckley said he was “lucky enough to have seen Offaly win at hurling a couple of times, but this was unreal”, adding that it was unusual for golf to evoke such emotion.“Golf is my main sport and Shane being from here makes me feel that bit extra attached to the sport.”"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Crime could rise unless police numbers increase, says Sajid JavidQueen\u0026#39s favourite horse show loses its shine after administrative error means top riders will be no-shows next yearJurors use internet chat rooms to get tips on how to avoid serving, senior judge warnsEating a vegan diet can cut your risk of developing diabetes by almost a quarter, says Harvard scientists  Comment: Jo Swinson told the Lib Dems they can win the next election – and they really seemed to believe itSnakes seeking water during UK heatwave could become trapped in garden netting, say expertsUK could experience its hottest night on record, as NHS advises people to keep windows shutComment: We have the chihuahua-stealing seagull louts we deserveTory leadership latest:  Sir Alan Duncan quit as foreign minister after plot to persuade the Queen to reject Boris Johnson as next PMMan in hospital with serious injuries after accident on set of Fast \u0026amp Furious filmCrack down on low quality qualifications such as floristry and horse management as Government axes their fundingGrave of \u0026#39real-life Asterix\u0026#39 who fought Caesar found amid trove of weapons and possessions in West Sussex French submarine lost in 1968 found at last in MediterraneanOfsted chief warns over Steiner schools as she reveals that three quarters failed inspectionHow Carl Beech went on the run to the edge of the Arctic Circle to escape the lawGroundbreaking HIV drug safe to use in women of reproductive ageTeenager obsessed with Columbine killers ordered deadly handgun and bullets for massacre, jury decidesRNLI urges Loch Ness monster \u0026#39spotters\u0026#39 against Area 51 style plan to storm the area Comment: If you can\u0026#39t share your money in a marriage, it\u0026#39s not a marriage worth being inWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"music photographer denis oregancaptures glamour rock n roll","story":"As one of Britain’s top rock photographers over the past 45 years, Denis O’Regan has collaborated with legendary artists including David Bowie, Queen and the Rolling Stones, creating iconic images and capturing both the grit and the glamour of rock star life.

These 52 sailors had been abandoned in some ways.Tides and currents in the western Mediterranean were modelled by the French team, as well as seismic data from the time that indicated the likely implosion of the vessel as it dropped to the seabed.The discovery was ultimately made on Sunday by a boat belonging to private US company Ocean Infinity, which found the Minerve at a depth of 2,370 metres (7,800 feet), a senior French naval officer told AFP.The \u0026#34Minerve\u0026#34 docked in the old port of Marseille, southern FranceThe search vessel - the Seabed Constructor, which is equipped with underwater drones with powerful cameras - arrived on the scene last Tuesday, the officer said on condition of anonymity.The Seabed Constructor was also successful in locating Argentina\u0027s lost San Juan submarine in November 2018 which disappeared in the Atlantic Ocean a year earlier.The cause of the loss of the Minerve has never been confirmed but the news that it has been found fought joy and relief to families.I can\u0027t find the words to describe my emotion, the wife of one of the lost sailors, Therese Scheirmann-Descamps, told AFP on Monday from her home in Toulon where she lives surrounded by black-and-white pictures of her husband Jules.It\u0027s extraordinarily soothing, for my children too. It\u0027s such a surprise, such a joy, she added.Fauve, who maintains a detailed website on the disaster, said there was unlikely to be any trace of the bodies.Earlier this year, Jacques Dannay, who was just two when his father disappeared on board, said he was hoping the search mission would give him closure.I know it\u0027s stupid, but for me my father isn\u0027t really dead for as long as we haven\u0027t found the wreck, he told AFP as the new search mission began. If someone told me he was alive, I\u0027d probably believe them.In keeping with naval tradition, du Che said the wreck would be left where it is and not touched.It is a maritime sanctuary, as is the case for all shipwrecks, he said.The Minerve was on a training mission in bad weather early on January 27 when it went down while returning to its base in Toulon, France\u0027s main Mediterranean naval port.Experts have speculated that the disaster was caused by a problem with the Minerve\u0027s rudder, a collision with another boat, the explosion of a missile or torpedo, or a fault with its oxygen supply systems.France is a world leader in submarine technology and its modern-day fleet of nuclear-powered vessels are seen as a key part of its defence capabilities and independence.The year 1968 saw the loss of three other submarines around the world.The USS Scorpion sank in the Atlantic, while the Soviet K-129 submarine armed with three nuclear missiles disappeared in the North Pacific.It was found by the US in a covert operation in 1974.The year was also marked by the disappearance of The Dakar, an Israeli vessel on its maiden voyage with 69 men on board. It was only found off the Greek island of Crete in 1999.Crime could rise unless police numbers increase, says Sajid JavidQueen\u0026#39s favourite horse show loses its shine after administrative error

seeking water uk heatwave could become trapped garden","story":"Grass snakes in search of water could find themselves trapped in garden nettingThe Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA)Wildlife experts have warned this week’s hot weather could see an increase in snakes becoming trapped in garden netting as the reptiles seek out food and water. Gardeners have been warned to raise the netting on their vegetable patches and ponds to prevent grass snakes becoming entangled, after a number of reports of deaths.During the summer the native UK snake can be spotted basking in the sun, as well as seeking rotting vegetation such as compost heaps to lay their eggs. Garden ponds also draw the reptiles to residential properties, due to their diet of small fish and frogs.But when ponds and vegetable patches are covered with flexible, and often plastic, netting they can become tangled and die from strangulation or cuts. Simon Cowell, CEO of The Wildlife Aid Foundation, said gardeners should lift the netting around their vegetable patches and ponds to prevent further deaths. “We see lots of it and we only really see the tip of the iceberg we expect,” Mr Cowell told The .“When you net your raspberries and beans, just start it 18 inches above the ground and then you won’t get these problems because the small animals can pass underneath them.”The RSPCA said it received more than 2,700 calls about animals tangled in netting in 2018.Often larger animals, such as fox cubs, become tangled in sports nets, which the animal charity recommends storing away at night to prevent deaths.A spokesperson for the RSPCA said: “Many people might not realise how dangerous netting is to animals. “Some animals survive, but very sadly some animals suffer fatal injuries, often as a result of struggling to get free.”Steven Allain, a UK snake expert, said the hot weather could potentially bring out more snakes, but it how many are in the local area, and how “attractive” ones garden is will depend on how many are seen. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA)Crime could rise unless police numbers increase, says Sajid

Asda announced earlier this month that the service would be rolled out to 50 stores by the end of this year.Amazon takes on Uber with investment in food delivery firm DeliverooSainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe failed to seal a £12bn mega-merger with Asda that he hoped would give the two supermarket chains the scale to confront challenges they face from all sides.The company\u0027s sales have been falling amid fierce competition from delivery apps and discount stores while further trouble could be ahead with online giants like Amazon making steps into the groceries market.Sainsbury’s sales dropped 1.2 per cent in its latest quarter despite large price discounts across a range of products.Clodagh Moriarty, Sainsbury’s chief digital officer said he\u0026nbsprecognised shoppers’ growing desire for convenience.\u0026nbsp“We’re excited to see what our customers think before deciding if, how and where we go next with the offer,” Ms Moriarty\u0026nbspsaid.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This forecast was based on a type of a no-deal Brexit, outlined by the IMF, that assumes no border disruptions. The fund’s more severe scenario incorporates significant border disruptions that increase Britain’s import costs.On another point, NIESR appears to be in greater agreement with the OBR: the think tank said there is a 25 per cent chance that the economy is already in a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction.

His impersonation of David as corny, lonely and uncool blew up and quickly became synonymous with the singer himself.Soon after it aired, David retreated to Miami and threw himself into working out.

Aside from Glastonbury, few other events spark so much excitement around the unveiling of their lineup. And while there are fewer “rock and roll” names on the billing this year, Primavera is leading the charge when it comes to proper representation of artists from different backgrounds, ethnicities and genders – without sacrificing anything in terms of quality. More than 50 per cent of the lineup is comprised of female-fronted acts, including Cardi B, FKA twigs, Christine and the Queens, Charli XCX, Robyn, Janelle Monae, Carly Rae Jepsen, Kate Tempest, Sigrid, Courtney Barnett, Yaeji, Peggy Gou and Helena Hauff. You’ve also got Interpol, Future, Nas, Mura Masa, Suede, Tame Impala, Kurt Vile and Mac deMarco. So it’s not as though guests will be short on options.Belgium’s biggest music festival often scores the most impressive lineup of any in Europe, and this year is no different. But don’t let the name mislead you: Rock Werchter’s lineup is always eclectic, and this year’s will include headline performances from Florence + the Machine, Muse and The Cure, plus Mumford and Sons, The 1975, Bring Me the Horizon, Kylie Minogue, Weezer, Brockhampton, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Mac DeMarco. The festival site is situated on a farm near the town of Leuven, which is just a half-hour train from Brussels so festival-goers can choose to stay in the city if they don’t feel like camping. Organisers take special care to ensure good accessibility for all, so there is a separate entrance for less physically abled guests, and plastic surfacing over the grounds for easier wheelchair use.Roskilde is the biggest festival in northern Europe, so you expect big names – and each year organisers deliver. This year it’s going big on “the power of pop” and its ability to bring people together, so you have avant-garde artists like Christine and the Queens plus goth-rock legends The Cure. Also on the billing are Jungle, Tears for Fears, Alma, Julia Holter, Parquet Courts, Travis Scott, Brockhampton and Flohio. You’ll be joined by more than 130,000 fellow music lovers, and situated right next to the Danish capital of Copenhagen with easy connections by train, bus and air.This has to be the best lineup of any festival this summer, plus it’s cheaper than Glastonbury and the weather will surely be better too. Artists performing include The Cure, Lauryn Hill, Vampire Weekend, The 1975, The National, Bon Iver, Robyn, Years \u0026amp Years, Mogwai, Sharon Van Etten, Iggy Pop, Gossip, Iggy Pop, Bonobo and Jorja Smith. The festival’s ferris wheel is the stuff of legend, providing guests with beautiful views of the festival site and beyond. Things don’t really kick off until around 6pm either, so there’s plenty of time to take in the surrounding art galleries, flea markets, parks and more fantastic restaurants, bars and shops than you could ever hope to visit in the space of one trip. Plus there’s a great indie disco that goes on until the early hours.There are so many reasons to try this festival in Portugal’s coastal capital. Let’s start with the music: each year Nos Alive manages to assemble a most erse yet cohesive lineup of artists, from pop and rock to electronic and heavy metal. This year its headliners are The Cure, Vampire Weekend, Gossip, The Smashing Pumpkins and Bon Iver. If that’s not impressive enough, you can also catch Jorja Smith, Hot Chip, H.E.R, Thom Yorke, Idles and Loyle Carner. The festival is set on the docks near two of Lisbon’s most breathtaking landmarks: the Jeronimos Monastery and the Belem tower. Due to the Portuguese culture of starting an evening out relatively late, there’s plenty of time to explore the city in the day, from the markets to the hundreds of fantastic restaurants, bars and shops.Slovakia’s biggest music festival also happens to be one of the most affordable in Europe. Its organisers understand modern music fans have eclectic taste and so they’ve invited everyone from Liam Gallagher, The 1975, Dream Wife, The Roots and Lykke Li to perform at the atmospheric Trenčín Airport.Melt’s creative director once described it as the “Berghain of German festivals”. Don’t let that scare you – by that he is more likely referring to the event’s vast scale and leaning towards electronic music, rather than the hedonism that takes place inside the notorious Berlin club. That said, the 20,000-capacity event still embraces themes of (cut) wild abandon, with house and techno acts playing non-stop (I’ve moved this) on the Sleepless Floor venue just outside the main grounds. Main stage attractions include Bon Iver, A$AP Rocky, Jorja Smith, Skepta, Four Tet, Bonobo and Yung Lean.This gem of a festival is ideally placed in one of Oslo’s biggest parks. It hosts a perfect mix of major British and US acts plus a wealth of Scandi artists placed right alongside them, to ensure homegrown talent isn’t overlooked. It’s one of the friendliest festivals in Europe: organisers are always around if you need help or questions answered, and there’s a collective good mood that continues regardless of the weather. Oya is also one of the greenest music events, and has relied on sustainable energy alone since 2009. Fifty per cent of the festival menu is meat-free, and organisers limit waste by using edible plates. You’ll likely spot Norwegian children picking up plastic cups dropped by guests – they earn a krone for each one they collect. This year’s lineup melds some of the best in hip hop, pop and rock, including The Cure, Robyn, Tame Impala, Sigrid, Erykah Badu, James Blake, Earl Sweatshirt, Karpe, and Christine and the Queens.There’s plenty to discover at this Hungarian festival, with its beach, themed parties and a week of music ning pop, indie, rock, folk, dance and reggae. This year organisers have managed to secure some of the biggest names in pop, including Ed Sheeran, Florence + the Machine, Post Malone, Twenty One Pilots and The 1975, plus Foo Fighters and dance music wunderkind Martin Garrix. Sziget is also passionate about looking after the environment, so guests can expect reusable cups, no straws unless requested,  recycling programmes, and an ecocamping programme.Location is the main draw for this hidden gem of a festival, which is set in the beautiful Sicilian town of Castelbuono – about an hour’s drive from the capital, Palermo. The main stage is placed at the foot of the castle – built during the Hohenstaufen rule in the Middle Ages – from which the town takes its name. There are few festival experiences like it: the stone bricks, which stay warm from the sun long after it has set, create gorgeous acoustics for whoever is performing. As is Italian tradition, things don’t really get going until the evening, so until then visitors can head to the beach or try some of the best food in Sicily, from pizza to granita, gelato and the famous Fiasconaro panettone. After that you can catch performances from the likes of The National, Spiritualized, Let’s Eat Grandma, Fontaines DC and Whitney, with more still to be announced. Most guests leave happy, tanned, and maybe a few pounds heavier than when they arrived.  Flow festival brings world-famous international acts to a Finnish demographic that is fiercely loyal to homegrown talent. Performing in Helsinki this year are Cardi B, Neneh Cherry, Tame Impala, Blood Orange, Yves Tumor, Earl Sweatshirt, Erykah Badu, Ibe Special, Makaya McCraven, Nitzer Ebb and many more. An infamous afterparty takes place on the skirts of a building site outside the festival walls, where DJs blast drum \u0026amp bass music and guests can take a dip in the sauna. Braver (drunker) souls occasionally make a bare-bottomed dash into the sea.  It’s been hailed as France’s answer to Glastonbury festival, and for good reason. Rock en Seine takes place at the historical site of Domaine National de Saint-Cloud, which is regarded as one of the most beautiful gardens in Europe. The lineup is comprised of a mix of global stars and some of the most exciting international up and comers, from Foals and Aphex Twin to Agar Agar, Sharon Van Etten, Bring Me the Horizon and Polo \u0026amp Pan.Primavera is one of the biggest and most anticipated festivals around.

Asda announced earlier this month that the service would be rolled out to 50 stores by the end of this year.Amazon takes on Uber with investment in food delivery firm DeliverooSainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe failed to seal a £12bn mega-merger with Asda that he hoped would give the two supermarket chains the scale to confront challenges they face from all sides.The company\u0027s sales have been falling amid fierce competition from delivery apps and discount stores while further trouble could be ahead with online giants like Amazon making steps into the groceries market.Sainsbury’s sales dropped 1.2 per cent in its latest quarter despite large price discounts across a range of products.Clodagh Moriarty, Sainsbury’s chief digital officer said he\u0026nbsprecognised shoppers’ growing desire for convenience.\u0026nbsp“We’re excited to see what our customers think before deciding if, how and where we go next with the offer,” Ms Moriarty\u0026nbspsaid.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018When Mr Musk first envisioned the Hyperloop system in a white paper in 2013, he suggested that vacuum tubes could allow transportation pods to\u0026nbsphit\u0026nbspspeeds of up to 1,000kph.The latest speed record is not only a long way off this prediction, it is also not on the same level as the fastest high-speed trains currently in use in China and elsewhere around the world.Yet the continued interest in the technology – not least among much larger operations in the form of Virgin Hyperloop One and HyperloopTT – means a faster and more commercially viable form of the Hyperloop may not be a long way off.After announcing the new speed record on Twitter, Mr Musk revealed that the 2020 edition of the Hyperloop competition will take place in a 10km vacuum tunnel with a curve.A longer test track should presumably lead to much faster speeds, while the curve will mean teams will have to prepare a pod that can cope with real-world routes.No further details were given about the new test track, though HyperloopTT has previously promised to build a 10km track along a stretch of desert separating Aby Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.The developers of the track hope for it to be in place in time for the Expo 2020 event due to take place next year.This track is important for the future of the Hyperloop, Dirk\u0026nbspAhlborn, CEO of\u0026nbspHyperloopTT, previously told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Once the\u0026nbspUAE\u0026nbsprout is completed, other Hyperloop networks around the world will be quick to follow, as the technology will already be there.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even recent Pixel phones have only notches at the top.But the new rumours show that the Google Pixel 4 could have a huge bezel at the top of its display. And it could be hiding something more than the usual selfie camera.It also includes a large oval opening at the top, which does not seem to be the right shape for a normal photo camera or for any of the other sensors usually held at the top of the display.Instead, rumours suggest that it could hold a motion-sensing system that will be able to precisely track where its owner is and what they are doing. That would presumably use technology developed as part of Google\u0027s Project Soli, which looks to build small radar sensors that can be put into devices the size of phones or even smartwatches.Google to fix Chrome bug that gives you away when browsing incognitoSuch a technology could be used to allow people to wave their hands in front of their phone to control it, for instance. Or it might allow for new ways of imaging or unlocking, in a similar way to Apple\u0027s FaceID system, which uses invisible light to measure people\u0027s faces and let them into their phone.The leaked images come\u0026nbspafter Google opted to share pictures of the Pixel 4 and pre-announce it, rather than allowing it to be revealed through rumours from other sources. But that reveal only showed the back of the phone, including its large camera bulge, and not the front.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Alternatively the vessel may have been sunk during the Russo-Swedish War of 1554 –1557.Although the ship is by far the best preserved vessel ever found from Europe’s Age of Discovery, it is of a Northern European rather than southern European design.However, the size of the ship, the shape of the perfectly preserved bow, the design of the anchors and of the masts and rigging are thought to be very similar to those of\u0026nbsp Columbus’ two smaller vessels, the Pinta and La Niña which he used along with the larger Santa Maria,\u0026nbspto cross the Atlantic and discover America in 1492.Ancient Roman shipwreck discovered undisturbed in MediterraneanThe discovery will therefore help maritime archaeologists and historians to understand more fully\u0026nbspsome of the ship technologies available to Columbus for his great 1492 voyage of discovery.What happened to the crew of the Baltic ship is a complete mystery? Were all or most of them killed in the attack which destroyed the ship’s aft-castle? Were they captured by the attacking vessel – or did they survive the attack but were somehow unable to launch their tender and consequently went down with their ship?The investigation of the newly discovered ship\u0026nbspis being carried out by an international team of scientists, including archaeologists from the University of Southampton.The whole project Is being led by Dr Rodrigo Pacheco-Ruiz, a maritime archaeologist working for the Swedish offshore survey company, MMT in collaboration with the Centre for Maritime Archaeology at the University of Southampton and the Maritime Archaeology Research Institute of Södertörn University, Sweden.Dr Pacheco-Ruiz, who is also a Visiting Fellow in Maritime Archaeology at Southampton, said: “This ship dates from Europe’s Age of Discovery, yet it demonstrates a remarkable level of preservation after five hundred years at the bottom of the sea.“It’s almost like it sank yesterday. It’s a truly astonishing sight,” he added.\u0026nbspThe vessel lies on the seabed with her hull structure preserved from the keel to the top deck and all of her masts and some elements of the standing rigging still in place.The extraordinary level of preservation is a result of the very low levels of oxygen near the seabed in that part of the Baltic.That massively reduces the number of micro and other organisms that would otherwise have quite literally eaten the vessel’s timbers.\u0026nbspThe video is therefore the first occasion on which anybody has been able to actually see a real almost totally preserved Age of Discovery vessel since the 16th century.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The pictures suggests that the ship is \u0027likely\u0027 to have been hit by a mine as the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo moves to blame Iran for the suspected attackNo EU state had seized a ship using force in seas over a sanctions breach before and Tehran accused London of acting on US instructions.But Jeremy Hunt told MPs that Iran “had no right to obstruct the ship’s passage, let alone board her” under international law.\u0026nbsp“It was therefore an act of state piracy. We will now seek to put together a European-led maritime protection mission to support safe passage of both crew and cargo in this vital region,” he said.“If Iran continues on this dangerous path, they must accept the price will be a larger western military presence in the waters along their coastline, not because we wish to increase tensions but simply because freedom of navigation is a principle which Britain and its allies will always defend,” he added.Fabian Hamilton, the shadow minister for peace, warned of a “tit-for-tat cycle of actions”. The Labour minister questioned why a British-flagged tanker was “left so hopelessly unprotected in the Strait of Hormuz”\u0026nbspwhen anyone with any understanding of the issue could see that “this was exactly” how Iranians would respond following the seizure of one of their tankers.\u0026nbspPompeo says ‘responsibility falls to UK to take care of its ships’Departing ministers takes swipe at Johnson over Zaghari-Ratcliffe caseIt is Trump that needs to be deterred from war, not IranIran sentences ‘CIA spies’ to death However, Mr Hamilton added: “Iran’s actions in recent weeks in the Strait of Hormuz have been utterly unacceptable and should be condemned from all sides.”The UK Chamber of Shipping backed the foreign secretary with Bob Sanguinetti, the chief executive officer, saying:\u0026nbsp “We welcome the announcement of a joint European maritime mission to protect British and European interests in the Strait of Hormuz.\u0026nbsp“While the European maritime mission is a step in the right direction, It is imperative that the UK government continues to protect the interests of British-flagged ships in the Gulf while the mission is assembled. This means formulating a mechanism that will provide confidence and security to allow ships to pass through the straits safely and securely. We continue to work closely with government to achieve this,” he added.The foreign secretary’s announcement came on a day in which Iran announced that it has arrested “17 spies” for working for the CIA, with some sentenced to death. The intelligence ministry in Tehran claimed the suspects had been collecting information on nuclear, military and other sectors. Donald Trump said the allegations were “totally false”.The Iranian authorities also released images of crew members on board the Stena Impero showing Iranian officials talking to them and meals being prepared.\u0026nbspStena Impero’ seen in an image released by Iranian state media (EPA)The majority of crew are Indian and the Iranian embassy in India said they were in good health and were being well looked after. The crew of the Iranian tanker being held in Gibraltar are also predominantly Indian. Delhi was one of the main purchasers of Iranian oil before the Trump administration imposed new sanctions. \u0026nbspSome Iranian officials have been of the view that the UK may start to take a tougher line with Tehran, especially with the imminent expected arrival of Boris Johnson in Downing Street, and hawks in the US administration may try to bring their influence to bear.Despite his frequent tirades against Iran, President Trump aborted planned military strikes after attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf earlier this year. He has also given Senator Rand Paul, who has been a steadfast opponent of America’s wars abroad from a right-wing libertarian stance, a role in negotiating with Iran.\u0026nbspThe Kentucky senator is being viewed as a counterweight to the president’s national security advisor, John Bolton, who has been a serial advocate military intervention and has, in the past, called for regime change in Tehran.The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, appeared to think there is a risk of a Boris Johnson government becoming susceptible to pressure from the American hawks. He tweeted on Monday: “Having failed to lure @realDonald Trump into War of the Century, and fearing collapse of his #B Team, @AmbJohnBolton is turning his venom against the UK in hopes of dragging it into a quagmire. Only prudence and foresight can thwart such ploys.”While the Trump administration has\u0026nbsptried to dismantle the\u0026nbspJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), reached between international powers and Iran over its nuclear programme, the other signatories – Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China –\u0026nbsphad sought to keep it going. The European states are seeking to set up a payment mechanism under which businesses can continue trading with Iran, circumventing US sanctions.“On the tankers we are unhappy with the UK about what happened in Gibraltar. But there was good dialogue. What we are worried about is whether this would change with Britain trying to show its loyalty to America,” the official added.Earlier in the day in London, Theresa May chaired her last Cobra meeting and her spokesperson rejected claims that it had rejected a US offer to escort British ships through the Gulf. A spokesperson said: “There has never been a US offer that has involved them escorting all UK ships. The US has been discussing with a number of countries, including the UK, how we might deliver maritime security in the face of recent threats to shipping.”As for Washington, secretary of state Mike Pompeo said on Monday when asked about the tanker, that\u0026nbsp“the responsibility ... falls to the United Kingdom to take care of their ships”.Downing Street also sought to refute charges that the royal navy had been so denuded by cuts in the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review that it had failed to protect UK vessels from Iranian gunboats.\u0026nbsp“We always said that we will ensure we have all the capability that we need in order to protect the UK and serve its interests. We have the largest military budget in Europe. We are investing in a world-class royal navy”, the spokesperson said.“The high volume of ships moving through the Strait of Hormuz – up to 30 ships covering more than 100 nautical miles – makes it impossible to escort vessels inidually. We already work closely with international partners to ensure a co-ordinated effort to defend freedom of navigation, this includes sharing information on threats to shipping and offering mutual protection for each other’s vessels,” he added.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This forecast was based on a type of a no-deal Brexit, outlined by the IMF, that assumes no border disruptions. The fund’s more severe scenario incorporates significant border disruptions that increase Britain’s import costs.On another point, NIESR appears to be in greater agreement with the OBR: the think tank said there is a 25 per cent chance that the economy is already in a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The OBR also said last week that the UK may be slipping into “a full-blown recession”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ebola has been in Beni for almost a year now.\u0026nbsp“Blood started coming out of his body,” she told The Independent. “They brought him to the hospital but there was no cure. I caught the illness because I was looking after him. I started vomiting and had a headache and flu. I felt so sorry for myself. But I went to the hospital in time to be cured.“I was really sad because he was the only son I had. Sometimes when I remember everything that has happened, I start burning. Ebola attacks more women than men because women are more compassionate. Most of the time, if a baby gets sick, it is the woman who brings her to the hospital.

She also explained Ebola survivors, such as herself, face a great deal of stigma within the community.\u0026nbspThe WHO declared the Ebola epidemic a public health emergency last\u0026nbspWednesday – with the director general appealing for the international community to help with funds.\u0026nbspDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the WHO\u0026nbspwas working on a new plan to control the epidemic which would cost “hundred of millions” of dollars. On Monday, the DRC’s health minister Oly Ilugna\u0026nbspresigned in protest at an announcement from the presidency that it would take control of the Ebola outbreak\u0026nbspresponse.Global emergency declared over Ebola after deadly outbreak in centralKellie Ryan, a spokesperson for the International Rescue Committee’s (IRC)\u0026nbspEbola response, estimated the latest death toll for Ebola in the DRC\u0026nbspto be 1,698. She said around 12 new cases are reported every day and there have been 2,522 confirmed and probable cases.She argued women in the country were bearing the brunt of the crisis – with women more likely to get the illness than men due to women being the “primary caretakers” of children, the sick and the elderly, which exposes them more to the virus.\u0026nbspMs Ryan added: “Gender inequality does have something to do with this. More than 60 per cent of confirmed and probable cases are women. Additionally, because women take care of the home, they have to go out to fetch water more often to keep up with more frequent hand washing practices and rigorous cleaning. This makes them vulnerable to gender-based violence as they are travelling by themselves more frequently.“Survivors of Ebola face stigmatisation by members of their community and sometimes even their families. Neighbours might think they are still contagious and will not want to engage with them or let their children play with their children. A woman’s husband might think she can still pass on the disease. The IRC provides survivors with psychosocial support to help them handle these feelings of isolation.”She said the fragile security situation makes it harder for herself, her colleagues and others responding to Ebola to do their jobs.\u0026nbspWhat is Ebola and what is the risk to travellers?“Due to attacks by armed groups, we are sometimes forced to suspend programming to ensure the safety and security of our staff,” she added. “Ebola is a very complicated disease, and the outbreak is happening in an area and to communities that have faced decades of violence by armed groups. It is easy to understand why the local community distrusts the response. Ebola is a new disease to them, and they can’t understand why a year on, cases continue to rise. There are rumours that health workers are profiting off the outbreak or even brought Ebola to the area themselves.”Since January, there have been 198 attacks against the health response that have led to seven deaths and left 58 healthcare workers and patients injured. Clinics and treatment centres have been torched.The current outbreak in the eastern part of the DRC started last year\u0026nbspand is the tenth to hit the country since 1976 when the virus was first discovered. It is the second biggest Ebola outbreak, after the west Africa epidemic which saw 28,616 cases of disease and 11,310 deaths reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between 2014 and 2016.The crisis has come to a critical point since the first case of Ebola in the eastern city of Goma was confirmed earlier in the week.

After some days I\u0026nbspstarted having diarrhoea.”She went to the hospital where they tried to place her in an Ebola treatment centre but she ended up going home because she was scared.

The international community considers both areas to be occupied territory, and the Palestinians seek them as parts of a future independent state. ​Sur\u0026nbspBaher\u0027s\u0026nbsplocation has placed it in the centre of these disputes. Parts of the village lie inside the municipal boundary of Israeli-occupied east Jerusalem and parts outside the barrier, in the West Bank. But some lies in between: just outside the Jerusalem line but still on the Israeli side of the barrier.Palestinian owners say their buildings lay within areas run by the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and maintain they had secured PA permits to build. But Israel’s Supreme Court rejected a final appeal from residents of\u0026nbspSur\u0026nbspBaher\u0026nbspthis month, clearing the way for the demolitions. \u0026nbsp“My kids, having just woke up, were terrified and thought it was a nightmare. I looked around and found many of my neighbours standing outside their homes as well. I saw\u0026nbsp40 or 50 bulldozers and maybe a few hundred soldiers,” said Abo El-Saeed El-Kaswany, 40 who owned one of the four houses that have already been razed.“I still have no idea where to go with my five kids. I’ve been making phone calls to find if someone would host me for a few weeks until I find a more stable solution.”Minister boasts Israel ‘only country in the world\u0027 killing IraniansBtselem\u0027s\u0026nbspAzouri who was also at the scene said the people were given permits from the PA to build as the area should mostly under full Palestinian control.\u0026nbspHowever the Israeli security forces came at\u0026nbsp2am\u0026nbspand forced 25 people to leave their home. They beat some people and arrested others, he told\u0026nbspThe Independent.The families told me they will live in tents on the rubble of their homes, they are poor people and do not have the money to rent houses, he added.\u0026nbspGilad\u0026nbspErdan, Israel\u0027s minister of public security, said the Supreme Court ruled the illegal construction constitutes a severe security threat and can provide cover to suicide bombers and other terrorists hiding among civilian population.\u0026nbspPalestinian Prime Minister\u0026nbspMohammad\u0026nbspShtayyeh\u0026nbspdescribed the demolitions as a “grave aggression.”This is a continuation of the forced displacement of the people of Jerusalem from their homes and lands — a war crime and a crime against humanity, he said.The European Union criticised the demolitions, saying in a statement that “the continuation of this policy undermines the viability of the two-state solution and the prospect for a lasting peace.Sur Baher (EPA)The UN\u0027s\u0026nbspMcGoldrick\u0026nbspand other UN officials called on the Israeli authorities last week to halt the demolition plans. They said 17 Palestinians faced displacement from the plans to level 10 buildings, including dozens of apartments.Mr\u0026nbspMcGoldrick\u0026nbspsaid the UN was watching with sadness at events as they\u0026nbspunfolded.No amount of humanitarian assistance can replace a home or cover the massive financial losses sustained today by the owners, he wrote adding some of the affected were refugees and so twice displaced.\u0026nbspWhat happened today in\u0026nbspSur\u0026nbspBahir\u0026nbspis of even greater significance, as many other homes and structures now risk the same fate...

The British boozer is in crisis.More than a quarter of all pubs have closed in the past two decades, from , in  to ,, according to the Office for National Statistics. We are losing three pubs a day. At this rate we will see the end of the British pub within our letime.So I got together with two friends who, like me, had never been in the licensed trade, to rescue this wonderful, warm, welcoming, Grade II listed building so everyone can continue to enjoy it. And I am not alone.I know of whole communities that have got together through crowd funding to save their local, with £.million being raised through internet donations for ious establishments last year.People are coming to realise that we can’t afford to lose these treasured spaces. There is no social network that can beat the pub, particularly in a world so insular where people have their noses in a mobile phone the whole time.It is so important people sit up and have a good chat, whether it is with a stranger at the bar or one of the staff. Workers come in after grafting and want to speak to the barmaid about what a hard day they’ve had, about the van breaking down or the tractor engine blowing up.Pubs often have football teams, darts, dominoes, quiz nights and are a venue where many great bands played their first gigs. In other places you will find a small shop at the local, because the village one has closed.At The Half Moon we sponsor the village cricket team, have Women’s Institute meetings with tea and cake in the morning, charity events and people come to celebrate weddings, birthdays and anniversaries.And no, nanny state meddlers, this isn’t about encouraging drinking, it’s about popping down to the local for a pint once or twice a week, which isn’t going to do any harm.The pub is now a place that families visit and I want everyone to treat it as their home.  My mum is in the garden, my dad helps out and my son Indio comes in to ask our head barman: “Can I have the usual please” — by which he means an apple juice and a packet of crisps.I had noticed pubs closing, but I hadn’t realised the reason until I became a landlady myself. Someone needs to give this industry a break. Landlords and land–ladies can only make tiny margins on the beer they sell, due to the high taxes they have to pay.That’s why I got involved with the Long Live The Local campaign last year to help pressure the Government into freezing beer duty. Everything is trying to kill this incredible part of British culture, whether it’s business rates, beer tax or sugar tax.Our rates are three times the European average and we pay almost  per cent of all beer duty across the EU, while drinking only  per cent of the beer. But the industry employs around , — many of them young people — and puts £BILLION into the economy.I can’t thank The Sun enough for its support in helping our campaign. I don’t think we would have received as many signatures without the help of you, the readers. Thankfully, the Chancellor listened to our case, agreeing in the last budget not to raise duty on beer.Sin taxes are high enough already and I hope the next Prime Minister will give us a break. It was an honour to be named  Beer Drinker Of The Year by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, which promotes the unique role of the pub in our society.Certainly there is hope that this great institution can survive by changing with the times and adapting to new tastes.  It is amazing seeing all the microbreweries and gin distilleries starting up, with a new generation enthusiastic about real ingredients.The gastro pub movement also offers customers the quality food they desire. We were proud that our restaurant received two AA rosettes for culinary excellence in the first six months.But there is also a need for a pub to be a pub, where customers can come in with their wellies or work boots. At The Half Moon we have good dining on one side and an old-fashioned fireplace that drinkers can gather round on the other.For the first year I was there all the time, but now it’s wiping its own nose, so I go in two or three times a week — it’s my other jobs that pay the mortgage. It’s a great place to wind down, particularly on a Sunday, and it brings me a lot of joy.When I got the lease for the pub, a friend advised me to make sure I stood back once in a while to peer through the windows to see people having a good time. That’s why Britain’s pubs have to be saved.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The defendant was a few steps away from the mother.At that stage the mother said what are you doing, this is my son and that caused the defendant to let go of the sons hand.The court heard how Shepherd had several problems and had been prescribed an opiate-based painkiller.She had taken more than her prescribed amount earlier that day and had no recollection of the offences taking place in December last year.Shepherd told police she couldnt remember having any contact with any children and didnt intend to kidnap anyone.She was shown the footage and said that it was bad. She was apologetic and couldnt explain why she behaved the way she did and expressed remorse for scaring the children.During the hearing, a victim statement from each of the mothers was read out.Mr Kemp read the statement out from the mother of the first incident: The incident left me in shock.She wouldnt let go of my hand. She was worried for her brother and wanted to make sure he wasnt running off.Reading the second victim statement, Mr Kemp said: I find myself replaying the events of that afternoon four-or-five times a day.I find myself thinking about what could have happened. It doesnt bear thinking about.Since the incident, my son has become extremely clingy and gets upset. He calls to me that there are ghosts or monsters in his room.Judge Egbuna said Shepherds behaviour was completely out of this world.He said: Your actions on the CCTV, were, for the parents and children, terrying.”Shepherd admitted two counts of attempted kidnap of a child and was handed a two-year community order.This included  rehabilitation activity requirement days - the maximum that can be imposed.She would also have to undergo two-monthly reviews so her progress could be checked."},{"url":null,"title":"stamp duty abolish housing ladder","story":"Onward says the big giveaway should be paid for by whacking taxes on empty houses and second home buyers.The influential think-tank said the move will take a whopping , Brits out stamp duty altogether.This would save a family buying an average priced home of £, around £, on the purchase.While Londoners buying an average priced home in the capital of £, will save £, in the giveaway.Onward is urging Boris Johnson to make fixing Britain’s broken housing market a top priorityhe is crowned leader tomorrow.Chris Philip, a Tory MP and author of the report, said: “It is essential that the next Prime Minister takes early action to back homeownership and tear down the biggest barrier to hardworking people getting on the property ladder by radically cutting stamp duty.“These stamp duty cuts are designed to kick-start the home ownership dream – just as Thatcher did in the s.“These reforms will get the whole housing market moving – and help make sure we are making the best use of housing stock by making it easier for older people in large houses to move, allowing growing families to move in.”Onward says the tax giveaway for first time buyers and struggling Brits can be paid for by imposing taxes where.It is calling for a  per cent tax on homes left empty for six months or more, a raise in stamp duty for second home and foreign buyers, and an end to council tax reliefs for second home owners.Meanwhile, in a separate report, Tory MP and Boris backer Jacob Rees-Mogg is also calling for urgent housing reform.Writing for the IEA think-tank, he calls for housing to be built on parts of the green-belt where there is the highest need – particularly by transport hubs.While he says inidual streets and villages should be given the power to “build and beauty” new homes.Britain’s broken housing market was blames as one of the biggest reasons why young Brits deserted the Tories and flocked to Jeremy Corbyn at the last election.Both Mr Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have vowed to tackle the housing crisisthey become PM.And crucially, a cut would liberate the country’s gummed-up housing market, removing a major barrier discouraging older people from downsizing and freeing up space for new buyers.Millions are shut out of the housing ladder. Making it cheaper to move would be a major step forward in changing that.But let’s not forget it’s also urgent that we cut planning red tape and thousands more homes are built.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The only positive advice I was given was that another airline might not be as fussy as Ryanair – and that turned out to be the case.Shannon had other ID, including a driving licence with the same photo, so there was no doubt it was her.She added: I had a valid ticket with them and they just basically cut me loose and didn’t care what happened to me.I was so angry about it.Shannon got home ten hours late after flying to Gatwick then Edinburgh.Her stepdad Stephen Cross is baffled as to why British Airways allowed her on a flight when Ryanair didnt.He said: Shannon was very scared and upset.She was left on her own, when she should have been travelling home with her friends.A Ryanair spokesman said: It is each passenger’s inidual responsibility to ensure that he she is travelling on a valid passport , in compliance with Ryanair’s terms and conditions."},{"url":null,"title":"grime gran channel 4 series tea rapper","story":"Margaret Keefe may be an East London pensioner and doting grandma - but shes best known for dressing down the most well-known rappers of our time as they chuckle over cups of Yorkshire tea.Ms Keefe helped her grandson buy his first video camera to shoot grime documentaries in the early s - and has charted his success as the musics popularity exploded into the mainstream.Risky Roadz - real name Roony Keefe - became a pioneer in the scene with his ground-breaking films that showed another side to the music genre and the artists involved.He soon noticed that his grandma had a special rapport with the artists he would bring over.“She’s been encouraging and supporting all of us right from the beginning,” he told The Times.“She’s got a relationship with all the artists. She’s an -year-old woman, and she has a relationship with my friends.

secretions are thought to stave off signs of ageing as well as giving skin a “glowing” quality.As a result a raft of new snail farms have sprung up in the Far Eastern country as demand for the slippery shell-dwellers “mucin” rises.Over the last three years, farmers and entrepreneurial locals have begun keeping the snails that were once regarded as a plague on the crops.Snail slime has become worth more than gold with a snail mucin face mask costing upwards of £.Altogether the global slime industry is worth an estimated £ million.There are now more than  snail farms in the Thai province of Nakhon Nayok, two hours east of Bangkok.Phatinisiri Thangkeaw, a teacher, said she had begun her business by buying snails from nearby rice farmers, who were glad to be rid of them because they wreak havoc on newly planted crops.She pays local farmers around  for a kilogram of snails and now has more than , snails that she milks for their mucin and then sells.She told the : “Farmers used to throw them on the road or in the rivers but now they sell them to me to earn extra money.”The process of harvesting the slime is seen as humane, involving dripping water over the snails to encourage them to secrete the mucin, which does not kill or harm them.To keep the quality high, in Thailand the snails are fed vegetables and grains and are only milked once every three weeks.In Thailand, the raw mucin is all flogged to one cosmetics company, Aden International, which was established after Kitpong Puttarathuvanun saw a gap in the market.The businessman sells the slime both as an expensive serum and a dried powder.It was in the s that the potential of snail secretions were noticed by breeders in Chile, who marvelled at how soft their hands became after handling the slimy critters.The first cream containing snail mucin was produced in Chile, but more recently it has boomed in the Korean and American beauty market.The mucin contains ingredients like glycoproteins, hyaluronic acid, and glycolic acid.These chemicals are said to stimulate collagen, slowing the onset of wrinkles and healing acne and reducing scar tissue, though dermatologists are ided on the benefits.Other bizarre beauty treatments to hit the headlines recently include creams made from circumcised foreskins and “vampire facials” which involve rubbing your own blood on your

surrounded by makesht bedding.A pile of shoes can also be seen in the foreground.The picture was taken yesterday and released by Fars News Agency, a news agency with close ties to the Iranian regime.Other images show an Iranian soldier patrolling one of the ships walkways, and the ship seen from a distance down the barrel of a rle.Footage from Iranian state media showed the crew inside the ship, sat round a table talking and seemingly comfortable.Members can also be seen working in the ships kitchen and standing on what looks to be its bridge.Iran launched a gunboat and helicopter raid on the UK-registered ship last week, claiming the vessel had turned off its tracker and ignored warnings after hitting a fishing boat.Irans Revolutionary Guard later said on the countrys state television that the ship had been boarded for violating international maritime rules.But Stena Bulk, which owns the ship, said it was in “full compliance with all navigation and international regulations”.The move is widely assumed to have been a retaliation to the British seizure of an Iranian vessel off Gibraltar last week.The Iranian vessel was suspected of breaching an embargo on oil shipments to Syria, but Iran said at the time it would not leave such evil deeds unanswered.In a letter to the UN Security Council, the UKs deputy permanent representative Jonathan Allen wrote that the British vessel had been in Omani waters with its transponder switched on when it was approached.Stena Bulk said Iranian authorities had told them the ships crew were in “good health” and being held at Iranian port Bandar Abbas.But in a further taunt to the Royal Navy, Iran last night hoisted an Iranian flag over the vessel.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called the seizure illegal and said that British shipping “must and will be protected”.Dramatic footage released on Saturday showed the moment Tehran troops abseiled onto the ship the night before.The clip is thought to have been filmed in the southern port of Bandar Abbas, where jet boats have been sailing around the British ship.It has also emerged Tehran wants to impose a toll on all ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz, saying it would be used to protect the safety of the vessels.Any move to create a toll is likely to be met with hostility as a fth of the worlds oil passes through the strait.On Saturday, state-funded Press TV published an article, entitled From Piracy to Impotence, criticising British activity in the Gulf.Diplomatic spats aside, any objective review of the facts will not fail to recognise that in recent events in the Persian Gulf and the Gibraltar Strait, the UK has engaged in illegal, and destabilising, activities on at least three occasions, it said.Audio has also emerged of radio exchanges before the seizure between Iranian armed forces and a nearby British warship, HMS Montrose.In the recording, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard can be heard telling the Impero: If you obey, you will be safe. Alter course to  degrees immediately, over.After that, HMS Montrose can be heard telling the ships crew: This is British warship F.I reiterate, that as you are conducting transit passage in a recognised international strait, under international law your passage must not be impaired, impeded, obstructed or hampered.The frigate then asks the Iranian vessel to confirm it is not intending to violate international law by attempting to board the tanker, in the recording obtained by security firm Dryad Global.Moments later, Iranian special forces stormed the ship by abseiling down from a helicopter.Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, said that HMS Montrose had been an hour away from the Impero, too far to physically stop the seizure.Montrose is the only warship Britain has in the Gulf to cover the -mile strait.However, the government has not arranged fixed times at which civilian vessels from the UK could sail through the Strait under the protection of the frigate, as it has done previously to guard against Somali pirates.It can also be revealed that in April Britain withdrew two Royal Navy Wildcat helicopters, which were based close by in Oman and provided surveillance of the Strait for hostile Iranian activity.It said at the time they were “no longer needed”.A nuclear-powered submarine and Royal Marine Commandos could now be sent to bolster Navy defences in the Gulf.The moves were discussed at emergency meetings of the Government’s Cobra security committee after Friday’s hijacks.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned Iran it was choosing a “dangerous path” with its “totally unacceptable” actions in the Gulf.He said he had spoken to Iran’s foreign minister to voice his “extreme disappointment”.Last night Mr Hunt announced he had raised the maritime threat level to “level three” — or “critical.”The Tory leadership candidate is expected to use a Commons statement today to announce a package of diplomatic and economic measures.The UK could also push for EU and UN sanctions to be reimposed on the regime after they were lted in  as part of a deal on Irans nuclear programme.The UK and the EU have so far shown a willingness to help Iran ease the impact of sanctions reimposed by the US last year after President Trumps decision to withdraw from the deal.Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood today warned the Royal Navy is too small to protect British ships from Iran.He also threatened to freeze the countrys assetsit doesnt release the UK tanker.Askedthe drastic move was being considered, Mr Ellwood said: Cobra was taking place yesterday, so were looking at the operational responsibilities from that but, yes, we are going to be looking at a series of options."},{"url":null,"title":"hay fever alert african plume pollen surge asthma","story":"Britain is set to sizzle this week as an African plume sweeps in bringing temperatures as high as C in parts of the country.The rising mercury will come with sweltering humidity, prompting Public Health Englandto issue a health warning.PHE issued a level- alert and readiness warning -

It is a blight on the landscape.It is one of first things you see coming into Port Glasgow on the train.

Israeli troops have stayed there for years.Israel finally left Gaza in , and Hamas took control there after winning elections.But Israel still controls most of Gazas borders and coastal territory, deciding who can get in and out of Gaza, including goods.Hamas has demanded that Israel stop its restrictions.Since March , Palestinian protesters have taken part in the Great March of the Return, aimed at removing Gazas transient border with Israel.He also said “theof this holy landto the World of Islam is not a strange and unattainable matter.Irans supreme leader added that his country wont give up its stance in support of the Palestinians.Supporting Palestine is an ideological and religious matter, according to state TV.The official Iranian news agency IRNA said al-Arouris visit to Tehran followed a visit by senior Iranian parliamentary official Hossein Amir-Abdollahian to Lebanon last week.Iran backs both Hamas in the Gaza Strip and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.Iran and Hamas do not recognise Israel and have both called for its destruction.Trumps son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, is ing to the Mideast at months end to promote the administrations  billion economic support plan for the Palestinians.The Palestinians have overwhelmingly rejected the plan because it ignores their political demands.Instead, it relies heavily on private sector investment in the West Bank, Gaza as well as Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon. The US plan acknowledges its success depends on completing a long-elusive Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.However the chances of the US reaching any kind of peace deal with Iran and its hardline leader are looking bleaker by the minute.Earlier today Donald Trump described Tehrans claims it had smashed an American spy ring as just more lies and propaganda.He later added: If they want to make a deal, frankly its getting harder for me to want to make a deal with Iran because theyve behaved very badly.

Gulls are great opportunists, they arent going to distinguish between a particularly small dog and a small bird.What I would say is, especially at this time of year where adult birds are particularly protective of their youngsters,you have a very small dog, keep an eye on it.Peter Rock, an ornithologist at the University of Bristol told the BBC Radio  Today programme: These gulls are very large and as you know,youve been around gulls, youll know theyre very large and are quite capable of picking up small animals, quite commonly they will kill pigeons that look a little bit under the weather.If you have a very tiny little dog I suggest you dont let it run around on your garden as it might well become a meal. It would have to be very tiny like this one was.“If they can get something down their throats then they will eat it.“I’ve heard of pigeons and rabbits being eaten whole and they are capable of pulling them apart.“Given the chance they will eat anything and this poor dog sounds about the size of a rabbit but I do hope she gets him back.”Peter added: “Seagulls have been known to swoop low and act aggressively towards humans and even picking up a small baby may not be beyond the realms of possibility.”"},{"url":null,"title":"joel dommett host the masked singer itv","story":"The comedian-turned-presenter will host the channel’s latest Saturday talent show The Masked Singer.

Itaposs polluted, unclean, full of idiots and a horrible place to live. Another local said: Itaposs a rough, boring, chavvy, c**p hole. For a demonstration of the chav scooterists trying to impress the scummy lady chavs, simply go and look in Morrisons car park from pm onwards - thousands of the cretins, unfortunately they never seem to fall off. In shortyou like your car windows, teeth, kneecaps etc. then avoid this s***e like you would a man with leprosy! You have been warned.    Rochdale  The Greater Manchester town was described in unflattering terms by those who got in touch. One person said: Take in the smells - the strong whf of tobacco and fatty foods with subtle hints of exhaust fumes, sweat and damp vegetables from the market area - and seeyou can detect a undertone of vomit, Karate aftershave and old cheese. And another said: Welcome to the cesspit of the universe, where evolution took a break and spat out this breed of useless slack-jawed yokels with less IQ than a glass of water.  Doncaster  A respondent wrote: Youaposve probably been forced to pass here on the train at some time in your le and seen all the attractions such as smack and rat-infested flats. Ah Doncaster, that s**t-hole surrounded by other s**t-holes like Hull, Barnsley, Pontefract, Scunthorpe and Rotherham. A night out in Donny is magical, with bums sitting on steps drinking White Lightning near the old strip club or the Jobcentre, and chavvettes with near nothing on, looking to volunteer to contribute to Doncasteraposs rising pregnancy rate.  Hull  Hull has made the top  every year since  and is three-times overall winner - so this is possibly an improvement.

Blackpool  Describing itself as the entertainment capital of the North, it was once famed for its golden mile but now according to locals, conjures up images of drunken stags and hens, falling over in the street and spewing on themselves, before retiring to a grotty seaside.

While in Blackpool all you smell is weed, McDonaldaposs, KFC - you may think itaposs a jolly seaside resort with candy floss and donkeys but itaposs a scum-bucket for the transients who come here to draw benefits in a holiday resort instead of in an inner city.  Castleford  One local reported: Highly scientic research - walking down the high street - revealed that one in three inhabitants under the age of  fits neatly into the chav box. In a town where everybody is a blood relative of the person next to them, you have to wonder whether the chavdom stems from bad breeding, or in the case of Castleford, possible interbreeding.

The people of Oldham look as though the government has been performing nuclear testing in the area. If you want culture and sophistication, then look no further than Yorkshire Street and the local shopping centres, where Sports Direct is the new Hugo Boss and TJ Hughes is the new Harrods.  Blackburn  The Lancashire town hold the dubious honour of being crown the least offensive borough on list. One said: The estates make Syria look calm. You can guarantee thatyou dare to walk down these down-trodden dogs**t ridden estates - and mind the needles- you will spot the inhabitants walking freely in dressing gowns, fluffy slippers and in the case of women, undoubtedly pregnant, with a fag in their gob going to pick up another free prescription from the clap clinic.

Clune Park estate in Port Glasgow, Inverclyde, housed hundreds of shipyard workers during the areaaposs golden age of shipbuilding in the s. However, it is now home to around  people living in a handful of the  flats. Property on the estate was once the cheapest in Britain, with one flat selling for just £, at auction - but it has been plagued by arsonists and vandals with shops, a primary school and church are all boarded up and abandoned. It is now dubbed aposmini Beirutapos and been described as aposat risk of catastrophic collapseapos. Over the past eight months, arsonists have started  fires there and thieves looking for scrap metal to sell have smashed through walls in abandoned buildings.  Leader of Inverclyde Council, Stephen McCabe, said: It is a decimated, isolated community. It is a blight on the landscape. It would remind you of somewhere like Chernobyl. However, plans to bulldoze the tenement blocks has resulted in a long and bitter battle between Inverclyde Council and private landlords refusing to sell up. Despite stark warnings that the conditions are not suitable for habitation, a handful of residents are clinging on - kept there either by the astonishingly low rents, or an unwillingness to leave.    With rents as low as £ for a one-bed flat, within easy reach of Glasgow, the estate has become an unlikely commuter belt for those brave enough to stay there. Julie Kane, , has lived on the estate for two-and-a-half years after moving from the idyllic Isle of Skye where she lived for more than  years. She pays £ per month for her one bedroom flat and despite thinking the area was like a aposmini Beirutapos when she moved in, she loves her home and finds the area apospeacefulapos. Julie, originally from Yorkshire, said: Iaposve got connections in Glasgow through family and was going to move into Glasgow city centre but the rents were outrageous.    Somebody said try over here and at first when I saw the place I thought aposOh my god, a mini Beirutapos. At that point there was a lot of complaints from tenants about drug addicts and things but the flat was brilliant for the price so I thought Iaposd give it six months and Iaposve been here ever since. I was like aposmy goodness, I can actually stay here and workapos, and have gone down to part-time because of my cheap rent. She would like to see the estate occupied by working people seeking affordable rents - and strongly believes money should be invested to bring the buildings up to scratch. Julie said: When I first moved in I was a bit wary, there were junkies and gangs on the street.    There was open prostitution and drugs going on, but thataposs all gone. Iaposve no fear of walking around - itaposs peaceful. But Inverclyde Council - which described the estate as a aposfestering woundapos and warned of a risk of aposcatastrophic collapseapos and apospotential tragedyapos - estimated ten years ago that costs of renovation would stretch to nearly £ million. The local authority has bought  of the flats and issued aposclosing ordersapos - meaning the homes cannot be inhabited - on another . Julie said: I look around and wonder why it was allowed to get in this state.    My tenement is full so weaposve got a lovely community there. Most of us are working in my block and Iaposd like to see more people come in like that who want affordable housing and want to work. In , a regeneration plan was agreed by the council, and three years later a compulsory demolition order was issued after the renovation of the flats was ruled out due to costs. But it was fought viciously by landlords owning  properties, around a quarter of the total - and in  a sherf revoked the order.    Jim Cameron, , who has lived on the estate all his le, said: All the houses were full when I stayed on Montgomery Street, then I got married and moved over the street. Maxwell Street used to be a good street but now itaposs a e. Despite warnings about the state of the buildings, Jim insisted: But itaposs safe. The local authority has gradually been buying up properties across the five blocks but some landlords have refused to sell up, demanding more cash.    Pensioner Marie Morrison, who has lived in the area for nearly  years, believes the warnings are justied but refuses to move regardless. She said: I donapost feel itaposs safe to live around here. These houses are going on fire quite regularly, there was one the other week. A lot of people are saying itaposs deliberate.    Councillor Michael McCormick, Convener of Inverclyde Councilaposs Environment and Regeneration Committee, said: In the councilaposs opinion all of the flats on the estate are Below the Tolerable Standard- they donapost meet the basic requirements to be classed as fit for people to live in. And the results of several, recent, independent surveys have done nothing to change this view. The poor physical and social conditions in the area, combined with the level of input required from Police Scotland, Scottish Fire and Rescue and Inverclyde Council, clearly shows that the private housing market has failed and that large-scale, planned intervention is urgently needed.

At the age of just  Clinch became one of the youngest children in Britain to get an ASBO after he terrorised locals in his neighbourhood. But despite him being named and shamed by a court, Clinch has clocked up  offences on his record including criminal damage, harassment and assault. He was arrested again last November after he gave a man an unprovoked beating whilst drunk following a house party near his home in Little Lever, Bolton, Greater Manchester.    Victim Paul Cauldwell suffered a broken nose, bruising and swelling to the face plus two lacerations to the left side of the forehead and a nasal fracture in the attack and feared losing his job due to time he took off work.

This is where the assault occurred. The defendant attacked Mr Cauldwell punching his jaw and kicking at him with the victim falling to the floor. The defendant continued to punch and kick Mr Caldwell whilst he lay in a ball on the floor trying to protect himself. The defendant has  separate offences on his record, criminal damage, harassment, common assault, disorderly behaviour, drunk and disorderly, theft and threatening behaviour.” In a statement Mr Cauldwell said: “I was in a lot of pain following this incident. There was no explanation for the attack. I offered him somewhere to stay and that’s how I was repaid. I had to take time off work I was in so much pain. At one point I thought I may lose my job.”  In mitigation defence lawyer Simon Gurney said: “He does have antecedents but he thought he had put that past behind him. He has not been in trouble recently. This offence is isolated against that background - a couple of old friends drinking to excess and then play fighting which got out of hand. My client concedes he used excessive force and accepts this offence crosses the threshold. But he has had five years without offending and he hopes this has not undone the good work done in those five years.” Clinch was given  months jail suspended for two years and will be electronically tagged as part of a four month curfew from pm to am.

Gizmo, the four-year-old miniature pooch, was carried off in the birdaposs beak while owner Becca Hill was hanging up the washing in Paignton, Devon.The little dog has not been since the bird flew him, by the scruff of his neck, skywards at pm on Sunday, Devon Live reported.The shocking incident has led many to question what kind of bird would prey on a small dog in such an aggressive manner. Some eagle eyed bird watchers suggested it could be a aposblack backedapos gull - a typically bigger breed.    Tony Whitehead, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds spokeperson, claimed the bird was a aposherring gullapos before speculating on its motives. A recently fledged herring gull could have come into conflict with a dog and the gullaposs parents would have defended it, he said. But he admitted there may be a more sinister explanation. The other possible explanation is that it was just predation. Gulls can certainly take small mammals as well as other birds. It is really rare for a dog to be attacked, although this is no comfort to the dogaposs owner. Our advice is be aware.    If you know you have gulls nesting on the roof or a neighbouraposs roof and you have a really small dog then just keep an eye on it, especiallyit is an enclosed space like a garden where a young gull can be backed into a corner. While news of the chihuahuaaposs plights has had dog owners across the country clutching on to their four-legged best friends, Mr Whitehead urged calm. Obviously itaposs not going to take a Labrador away, he added. Iaposve never actually seen a herring gull carrying a dog before. In May  another Devon pet owner watched in horror as her beloved chihuahua puppy was killed by a flock of seagulls. Niki Wayne, , found the birds pecking tiny Bella to death after the pup pushed open a door and got out.

Shoppers described it as a front thong and have commented on how uncomfortable it must be to wear. Many are also very sympathetic to the model for having to wear it, and others have gone as far as to say it makes her look like a prostitute.    The bodysuit is made from  per cent Polyester and five per cent Spandex. It costs ., but can be shipped to the UK so donapost worry about missing out. One shopper wrote: Ahhh it looks painful wtf. aposHideousapos harness shorts with crotch cut outASOSaposs harness aposshortsaposcaptured shoppersapos attention in February .Peopleaposs biggest problem with the £ item is that they had absolutely no idea what itaposs meant to be for.    Featuring big cut out  around the crotch area as well as on the legs, the high-rise waist design is being described as a major trend on the shopping site and claims to give you the confidence to express your iniduality. People on social media joked that the item would be great for giving the wearer extra pronounced leg bulges.

As part of his research, Professor Frederick had more than , participants from a range of educational backgrounds complete the test - and even those attending top American universities such as Yale and Hard struggled to work out all the answers. Of all those who took part only  percent managed to score three out of three on the test, meaning  percent of people failed - how will you fare     Speaking about the test, Professor Frederick, said: The three items on the CRT are aposeasyapos in the sense that their solution is easily understood when explained, yet reaching the correct answer often requires the suppression of an erroneous answer that springs aposimpulsivelyapos to mind. Hereaposs a look at the questions: . A bat and a ball cost . in total. The bat costs  more than the ball. How much does the ball cost  .

If it takes  days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake     These are the three most common answers that people guess - but they are actually incorrect. .  cents .  minutes .  days    Professor Frederick adds: Anyone who reflects upon it for even a moment would recognise that the dference between  and  cents is only  cents, not  as the problem stipulates. In this case, catching that error is tantamount to solving the problem, since nearly everyone who does not respond apos centsapos does, in fact give the correct response. The correct answers are: .  cents .  minutes .  days    Still puzzled by all of this  Thankfully, Presh Talwalkar, the author of The Hoy of Game Theory: An Introduction to Strategic Thinking explained how to work out the correct answers on his blog, Mind Your Decisions. . Say the ball costs X. Then the bat costs  more, so it is X + . So we have bat + ball  X + . because together they cost .. This means X +   ., then X  ., so X  .. This means the ball costs  cents and the bat costs . . If it takes  machines  minutes to make  widgets, then it takes  machine  minutes to make  widget . If we have  machines working together, then each can make a widget in  minutes. So there will be  widgets in  minutes. . Every day FORWARD the patch doubles in size.

But the cuddly black and white bear has made signicant progress in recent years, growing in numbers from about , in the s and , counted in . The good news meant the species’ threat level was downgraded from endangered to threatened in . And many credit Chinaaposs heightened efforts over the last decades to protect the panda population and its habitat with its ressurgence. Now, the Chinese government has gone further, creating a supersized national park for the bears. It which spans across the areas where the  known groups of pandas live.    Giant Panda National Park will cover , square miles of southwestern China - half the area of Wales and three times the size of Yellowstone National Park. The new park will restore and reconnect fragmented panda habitats in an effort to reunite bear populations that have become separated from each other. Conservationists believe that reunited giant panda groups will give them a better chance to breed, helping to boost numbers of the bear even further. One of the problems with protecting the pandas is that they have a very low reproductive rate, with females generally only fertile for one to three days each year. And they give birth usually only once every two years. But it is hoped the new park will give the bears room to roam and find mates, increasing their chances of survival.    Most of the park will be in Sichuan Province, home to more than  per cent of wild pandas, and where in  a huge magnitude  earthquake destroyed large swathes of panda habitat, as well as several pandas. This and other natural disasters, as well as logging, road construction, agriculture and human encroachment, have degraded the landscape and broken up populations. The mammal is now confined to to six mountain ranges and split into  groups, some of which have few than a dozen iniduals. Marc Brody, a founder of the ecotourism and conservation organisation Panda Mountain said he is pleased the Chinese government is “specically targeting habitat rather than focusing solely on the animals. “That’s why this park’s mission really matters. Habitat will remain patchy until degraded lands are restored and stronger land-use restrictions get enforced that make wildle corridors possible.” If such corridors become reality, “that will be the exciting legacy of this park,” he said.

The shipwreck was discovered in the Baltic Sea off the coast of Sweden and, incredibly, it still has masts in place, swivel guns on deck and even parts of its rigging are intact. International scientists have used underwater robotic technology to examine the find. Dr Pacheco-Ruiz, a maritime archaeologist who has spent more than a decade exploring and mapping sea beds, said: This ship is contemporary to the times of Christopher Columbus and Leonardo Da Vinci.    But it demonstrates a remarkable level of preservation after  years at the bottom of the sea, thanks to the cold, brackish waters of the Baltic. Itaposs almost like it sank yesterday - masts in place and hull intact. He added the boat dates back to the days of Christopher Columbus and Leonardo Da Vinci. However, the name and origin of the Renaissance sailing ship are not yet known.

Theyaposve found the vessel is older than previous historic findings, including the warship Mars, which was blown to pieces in the Firs Battle of land in , and Henry the VIIIaposs Mary Rose, built in . Unlike the Mars warship, which had its remains scattered after being blown to pieces, this unnamed, newly discovered vessel has its hull almost completely intact.

It reframes the story of Scotch whisky and suggests new layers of complexity in Scotland’s urban history.” vw, px\"  Dr Hawes said: “All references to aquavite or whisky from this period are signicant because its early development is largely unrecorded.“This could signicantly change our understanding of the origins of our national drink.”City archivist Phil Astley added: “This incredible find illustrates what an amazing resource the UNESCO-recognised Aberdeen Burgh Registers are for the study of Scottish urban history.“The detailed picture of late-medieval society that emerges from these records is one of a developing social structure increasingly influenced by the cultural, scientic and educational forces of the Renaissance period.”Researchers have now been awarded £, by Chivas Brothers to fund research into the still.Head of heritage and education Alex Robertson said: “This is a truly signicant and exciting discovery for Scotch whisky.“Given Chivas Brothers’ historical ties with Aberdeen, we did not hesitate to lend our support to the furtherance of this important research.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third.

The beds are trimmed neatly with green paths of grass and only the odd weed or two can be seen to peer through the burgeoning beetroot and beans.Often yoursquoll also come across one of the volunteers, the gardener oryoursquore very lucky, one or more of the children who help to tend the plants.The Edible Garden is a community garden nestled in the beautul Tweed Valley at Innerleithen and run by a steering group and volunteers.Its aim is to inspire, motivate and build confidence in adults and children of all ages and abilities to learn how to grow their own food to promote a healthy lestyle, to encourage the community to prevent food waste, reuse recycle to reduce landfill and to reduce their carbon footprint.The St Ronanites are horticulturists turned eco warriors, providing a range of workshops for the community in how to grow, harvest and recycle.Lessons include guidance on composting, propagating, soil preparation, solar power for growing, food preservation, seasonal planting, and bugs pests in the garden, carbon footprint and food waste recycling.The vibrant goings-on have recently stepped up a gear with the efforts of the steering group of Shirley Spence, Lisa Kurowski Leslie and Alex Smithson to win a share of the Tweeddale Localities Bid funding.This has secured the future of the garden for years to come and means that the sht of responsibility from the climate change group lsquoYou Can Cookrsquo to the independent body known as lsquoThe Edible Gardenrsquo is now complete.Shirley Spence said the support of the public and the staff and children of St Ronanrsquos Primary School have been crucial to this success.ldquoIt will allow the steering group to provide a part-time gardener, Alex Smithson, serve the schoolrsquos Eco Group with practical experience of environmental issues and fund the supply of equipment, compost and building materials for the foreseeable future.However, for those of you who have yet to find the garden, perhaps it would be helpful to whet your appetite with some details of what the project has accomplished so far.Firstly, as well as offering expert gardening advice to the supporters, Alex plans and prepares the crops and liaises with school staff to provide classes for the children to teach them about their environment and carbon footprint.The classes look at areas from recycling and horticulture to microbes and ecology.

They can pick their own five-a day where the food hasnrsquot ever met a plastic tray or a supermarket checkout.The gardenrsquos outreach doesnrsquot stop at the food though.

Governmentrsquos consultation include giving residents a stronger voice, plans for a new building safety regulator, and strengthening enforcement and sanctions to deter non-compliance with the new

built to standards ldquono longer fit for purpose.She added: ldquoOne of my biggest concerns right now is that for the last two years we have carried on building buildings to a set of standards we now know are not fit for purpose.ldquoThe longer we carry on before we put this regulatory framework in place the more buildings we are putting on to our housing stock that will need our rectication

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

The first three weeks of sailing lessons have finished successfully with many of the participants enjoying themselves so much that they signed back on for a second week.The fourth week looks to be particularly busy with demand for the under-s course so high that organisers have had to change the afternoon from adult lesson to under-s. There are still spaces available in weeks five and six for both under-s in the morning lessons and adults in the afternoon lessons.Last weekend also saw the club hosting Cushendall Sailing Club for theleg of their annual race.The club’s relationship with Cushendall goes back more than  years with both clubs visiting each other every year and holding a yacht race with the inidual winner over both legs winning the North Channel Shield and a prize for the winning team.This year there was no race when Campbeltown visited Cushendall as there was not enough wind and so all was to play for when the race began last Saturday afternoon.This year#s inidual winner was James Farrell, skipper of Sigmania, a Sigma  from Cushendall. A worthy winner, James is a highly experienced sailor and has coached the Northern Ireland dinghy sailors at international level. The team prize also went to Cushendall.The event is not all about the yacht race, as the social side is also very enjoyable and friendships have been made and sustained over the years. The relationship between the two clubs is very strong and there is a feeling in both camps that this event is a highlight of the sailing year and should be continued for years to come.For more information of the sailing lessons, visit Campbeltown Sailing Club#s Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"dairy farmers are positive about campbeltown creamerys future","story":"Farmers who supply milk to Campbeltown Creamery are #positive# that its award-winning range of dairy products have a future.This comes the week after First Milk, the farmer-owned co-operative which owns the creamery, announced that it plans to scale-down operations in Campbeltown.First Milk, which put its creameries in Campbeltown and Arran up for sale in April  because they #were not core to its business strategy for the future#, last Wednesday announced the start of employee consultation in connection with proposed changes at both sites.There are  farms across Kintyre and Gigha which supply milk to Campbeltown Creamery.Discussions with local farmer members, with the active involvement of the Scottish Government, remain ongoing.It is hoped the creamery will ultimately be owned by the local farmers, who, it is envisaged, will form a new co-operative to operate the creamery independently of First Milk.Due to the ongoing economic performance of the Campbeltown site, and in anticipation that the scale of the operation is likely to change under this new ownership, First Milk began consultation with staff at Campbeltown about proposals to scale-down the operation.A First Milk spokesman said this week that there are #potentially roles at risk# as a result of the restructuring at the creamery, which has  employees.James Barbour of Machribeg Farm, who is chairman of the Kintyre milk producers working group, said: #First Milk has worked hard to secure a sustainable future for the Campbeltown Creamery over the last  months.

by its current pharmacies.The committee also stated that there was too long a wait between the Consultation Analyst Reportand the hearing as over a year had passed, which it felt rendered the findings out of date.Representatives from the current Tranent pharmacies ndash Lloyds Pharmacy and Well Tranent, both on High Street ndash were present at the committee hearing and both claimed that they had already addressed any issues that were raised in the consultation and therefore problems raised by the CAR were no longer applicable.There was also a question over whether the premises planned for the new pharmacy at  Bridge Street would be large enough to support the planned two consultation rooms and dispensary area, which the committee felt raised the issue of whether appropriate confidentiality was possible.Letters of support for the pharmacy were submitted by Tranent and Elphinstone Community Council and ward councillor Kenny McLeod among others however, the committee felt that none of these letters ldquospecied needs which were currently not being met.Pharmacy applicant Niamh Morrison visited the community council to thank members for their support over the process and to assure them that she would be launching an appeal.She said: ldquoI am of course very disappointed.ldquoI really believe that this community needs this, and I have developed a real soft spot for the

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged.

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-2019","story":"Here are some photos from the events.There are a host of events still coming up: the full list of events during the festival is available here."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8712634.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

Some young women suffered worse fates: an explosion killed one local girl, others lost arms and fingers or were severely burned due to the fires which could break out. Their work and leisure lives were strictly monitored: everything came under the official secrets act and over  members of the Womenrsquos Police Service monitored their movements and morals!The museum is set across two floors with interactive displays including films, games and oral testimonies of people from World War One and Two. There is so much military history in this part of Scotland that it has been named lsquoThe Solway Military Coastrsquo and the upstairs in the museum the story continues into World War Two in this region and even includes a look at the start of the Cold War with a virtual reality headset experience to explore inside Chapelcross, Scotlandrsquos first nuclear power station.The Devilrsquos Porridge Museum regularly tops Dumfries and Gallowayrsquos things to do on Tripadvisor and has recently been shortlisted for the prestigious lsquoMost Family Friendly Museum in the UK Award.rsquoVisit the website, Facebook, Twitteror Instagram.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Philiphaugh EstateSituated just to the North and West of the Royal Burgh of Selkirk lies Philiphaugh Estate, perhaps best known for the Civil War battle fought between the Marquis of Montrose for the Royalistsand General Leslie of the Covenanterson  September .

Any sensible organisation would confirm something as serious as that. I got an email a while after saying theyrsquod be in touch within  days, but it took a couple of months for anyone to actually get in touch with me. When they did eventually, they just said they were looking at it.\"Irsquove had to phone for an update every month, but they just say it is still under investigation.

He is taking up more of my free time than I would like him to, trying to build up and collect all this evidence, and theyrsquove done absolutely nothing by the looks of it. Nothing whatsoever.\"Following the members complaint, but before Gregson was suspended from Labour, he brought forward a motion at the Edinburgh Central branch ,meeting calling for the group to object to Labours definition of anti-Semitism,He also called for an \"end to disciplinary actions against any affected member, shop steward, Labourist or employee accused of anti-Semitism under this definition\".The whistleblower said: \"When he brought forward this motion I was even more angry, as I knew I had complained, and others had complained, and yet he was able to just bring forward this motion to the branch.\"Sadly it is situations like this which are causing Labour to lose face. \"I fear the party as it was before the days of Jeremy Corbyn is pretty much lost for a generation now.\"I joined the party because I believed in their principles of wanting to help everyone and treat everybody equally. I joined to fight for things like that, not to fight other members.

The two were very close and worked together in the family building firm.ldquoAfter he died there was a void in my le and I didnrsquot know how to cope with my feelings. Thatrsquos when I started going downhill and taking drugs and overdoses.ldquoI came from a good home, ldquo he said. ldquoThere was nothing up with my childhood. I just wanted to do what everybody  was doing.\"When Mr Butler was hospitalised after a grand mal seizure that left him with no feeling in his legs, a friend in recovery persuaded him to attend Alcoholics Anonymous.: Care workers like zombies after years of gruelling sht patternsKnowing that he stood to lose his weand children, Mr Butler started attending daily meetings and continues to go at least three times a week.He said: ldquoPeople just need to fling themselves into this stuff, you canrsquot dip your toe in, you canrsquot do that.Initially the team, established in  and managed by Mr Butler, was made up of people in recovery but soon admissions were open to all.Mr Butler said: ldquoWhat I found was that the boys who just wanted a game of football were realising what we had in recovery and started asking to come to meetings because they were struggling with drink or drugs.ldquoWhat my team brings is a purpose, itrsquos why you want to stay sober. Itrsquos given me so much. That team is my family now.ldquoI feel absolutely blessed to have the le Irsquove got today. I used to want money and fancy cars and big houses and always tried to look good on the outside but when you come into recovery, you realise you need to be good on the inside and the outside will take care of itself.For player Gerry Broadley, , who joined Maryhill Milan in January, the team has been a leline.

It started from taking it on a Saturday when I was in the pub to taking it on the Sunday when I was hungover, then taking it on Wednesday to get me through to the next weekend. My mind was telling me I needed it when I obviously didnrsquot.Going from a ldquohappy-go-lucky type of guy to someone with a short fuse who would isolate himself, in the last year of his addiction, Mr Broadley could feel the time bomb of his addiction ticking.ldquoI knew that one day my world was going to crumble. It was just a matter of time before my we found out, or my work found out and my world was going to end there.It was during a family holiday last June the dad-of-two orchestrated his cry for help, taking so much money out of a joint bank account, his we couldnrsquot help but notice.ldquoMy we asked where the money was and that was my rock bottom.

The House of Commons is now very well placed to say whether or not the concept of Brexit placed before the voters at the time of the referendum is still defensible, and henceone can reasonably refer to the will of the people as expressed at that time as still being relevant. Accordingly I believe that a free vote ndash a vote of conscience ndash by the House of Commons, should be held, with two clear options: either to abandon the process of leaving the European Union, or to continue on a path to departure. This move would place Members of Parliament in their proper position as inidual elected representatives in a representative democracy of deciding on behalf of all their constituents which path to follow. Before the vote MPs should, I consider, be reminded that as they represent all their constituents , they must put aside party and personal predilections, and vote on what they believe, in conscience, is in the best interests of all of their constituents, of all of the people of the United Kingdom and of the concept of a peaceful Europe. An analogy would be the vote on the abolition of capital punishment.As there has been ample opportunity for debate prior to this pivotal point, I suggest that the making of speeches before a vote might be ruled out, other than a statement setting out procedure.Professor John R Hume, Glasgow G.THIS may be too obvious to say, but somebody has to: opposition to the Tories is tragically split. The more people change to the Liberal Democrats and the SNP, the more secure the Tories become.In one General Election, the SNP took all the seats in Scotland except one. Did that get the Tories out Whatever you say about Labour right now, the party is all wersquove got. If it won all its seats, the Tories would be out.We have to accept that some people have curious enthusiasms. I cannot believe that any adult would care where a ball lands, but there it is. I cannot believe anybody would be excited about his inadvertent birthplace, but there it is, and it includes my best friends.Now Labour says it is turning Remain. Its leaders must have been reading my letters.My favourite dream is one huge united anti-Tory party, who would concentrate on socialism and European membership, setting aside meantime, anti-Semitism and kne crime. Oh, and Scottish independence.Mrs Moyna Gardner, Glasgow G.Itrsquos a pity these measures werenrsquot taken right across the th century, when Scotlandrsquos economy was directly controlled from London, and suffered much lower growth rates than the UK. As one banker put it some years ago: ldquoScotland was in recession for  years.GR Weir, Ochiltree.MANY people are critical of our politicians, with good reason, but the underlying causes of their poor performance are not clear.One possibility is that the political approach to decision-making is derived from the legal system. Unfortunately, the practice of deciding outcomes by persuasive argument is not always fit for purpose outside the courtroom. Global warming will dominate le on earth for the foreseeable future and no amount of discussion or debate will change this, yet the Chancellor of the Exchequer insists on pointing out that the costs are very high, with the implication that we should continue burning coal, oil and gas. Of course the costs are high, but the alternatives even in the medium term are much worse.Brexit is a classic example of a decision that should be made following a determined and honest attempt to establish the facts and to make those facts public. Instead we have groups of people who think that they can win an argument, based purely on rhetoric. Evenmany of the outcomes are uncertain, there should be a process of evaluation that is not based on \"winning\" or \"losing\".A second possible reason for Westminster politicians to be so incompetent is that many are very poorly educated. To go from an expensive private school to Oxford, where  weeks a year for three years may be spent studying a subject of little or no practical relevance to le on this planet, is not a useful preparation for decision-making in a technically complex world. This is exacerbated by going straight into politics, buoyed by a high level of self-confidence and not the smallest notion of what le is like for those who have to earn a living. Perhaps the worst aspect of this career path is that the ones who end up leading the pack are those with the most confidence, not the clearest thinkers.A third possible reason is that Oxford graduates tend to go back to their professors for advice. If the professors are purely theoretical in their analyses they will be unable to reflect the realities of le and all the real world uncertainties that affect the outcomes of policy decisions.A fourth potential reason is that le in politics is very stressful. This seems to lead to a kind of febrile state, in which the politician loses all contact with reality le becomes a merry-go-round, based on lies and pretence, with the object to become famous rather than to serve.These observations are not specic to one party or another. Whichever way you look at it, the Westminster system needs to be reformed.Roger Waigh, Helensburgh.FOR months you have given over a complete page to letters on Brexit even though Holyrood estimates the financial impact on Scotland will be around pound billion a year. However, there is scant discussion provided over the annual pound billion cost of a ban on gas as part of a zero carbon policy.What is of even more importance to Scottish consumers is who will pay these costsndash that is, is it the domestic consumer or will politicians insist that renewable energy is price-matched to the p unit cost of gas  Ian Moir, Castle Douglas."},{"url":null,"title":"sumburgh-kirkwall-airports-close-air-traffic-strike","story":"Prospect union members have resumed industrial action after rejecting a revised pay deal from Highlands and Islands Airports Limited .Six airports are affected by the action as union members stage -hour strikes between Sunday and Tuesday.: Nurse wanted for idyllic Scottish island as Raasay seeks to boost its medical coverSumburgh Airport in Shetland and Kirkwall Airport in Orkney are shut today, while Inverness Airport was closed on Sunday.On Tuesday, Stornoway, Benbecula and Dundee Airports will be closed.Hial said the offer rejected by air traffic controllers comprised a retention allowance which would have seen them benefit from an additional pound, over a five-year period.Managing director Inglis Lyon said previously that he \"deeply regrets the inconvenience and upset to hundreds of passengers affected by the strike action\".He called on Prospect to resume talks to find a resolution to the dispute as soon as possible and claimed the union is asking for a pay increase \"far in excess of what we are able to afford\".: Bid to prevent leaves on the line rail delaysAir traffic controllers previously went on strike on May , when six airports were shut for  hours due to the industrial action.Prospect national secretary Richard Hardy said the strikes are a \"last resort\".\"Hial and Scottish ministers have left our members with no option but to strike,\" he said previously.\"Strike action is by its nature disruptive butwe are to safeguard the long-term future of air services in the Highlands and Islands we have to start paying air traffic controllers a fair wage.\": British Airways continues to suspend flights to Cairo over security fearsHial is a public corporation wholly owned by the Scottish ministers.A Scottish Government spokesman has said the Government encourages both parties to resolve the dispute as it is \"clearly not in the interest of passengers or the communities served by Hial airports\"."},{"url":null,"title":"seagull-snatches-pet-chihuahua-garden","story":"The bird swooped down and carried the miniature chihuahua away in its beak, its owner said.: MP backs contraceptive pill for problem seagullsBecca Hill, , of Paignton, is hoping four-year-old Gizmo will be found alive.She told Devon Live: \"My partner was in the garden putting the washing out at the time and suddenly he saw it swoop down.\"It carried Gizmo a fair way as we couldnt see him anymore.

Aldrin Jr. Neil had ancestral links to Scotland. The name derives from Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the Moon, and the Gaelic word for cow, Bò.Alex Keen, launch specialist from Sent into Space, said: “Launching at Gilnockie Tower was a real treat. Not only were the team from VisitScotland a great bunch to work with but the countryside we crossed in pursuit of our payload is one of the most beautul and dramatic landscapes we’ve visited. “Once the Coosmonaut was back in our hands, we were genuinely sad to leave and head back to England.”A new tourism map highlighting Scotland’s links to space exploration and the first moonwalk has also been released.On the new trail...among the Scottish landmarks on the new VisitScotland map is the dark sky observatory in Dalmellington, Ayrshire.The Scotland is Out of this World trail is part of the new VisitScotland campaign of the same name.The trail features Scottish connections to each planet in the solar system, as well as fun facts and details of science centres and the best places to stargaze.Highlights incude:data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.berwickshirenews webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"This is what , can fetch you across the UK\"  This is what you can rent for £, per month across the UK viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BERN | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BERN | Article Teaser\"Mars – Glenelg, Highlands: In  the village twinnedwith a geological feature on Mars, called Glenelg.Jupiter – Loch Airigh, Isle of Harris: The loch in the Outer Hebrides portrays the planet Jupiter in the  Stanley Kubrick directed film, : A Space Odyssey.Uranus – Braemar: The birthplace of Johann von Lamont, an astronomer who calculated the mass of Uranus.Neptune – Jedburgh, Scottish Borders: The birthplace of th century science writer Mary Somerville who theorised that dficulties in calculating the position of Uranus may point to an undiscovered planet, which inspired the discovery of Neptune.Venus – Parton, Dumfries and Galloway: The resting place of th century physicist James Clerk Maxwell, whose name was given to Maxwell Montes, the planet’s only feature named after a man.The Scotland is Out of this World campaign marks the th anniversary of the Apollo  mission and US astronaut Neil Armstrong’s historic walk on the lunar surface.But it also celebrates the th anniversary of VisitScotland.Malcolm Roughead, chief executive, said: “For  years VisitScotland has helped position Scotland as a must-visit destination to audiences across the world.“It is therefore fitting that in our anniversary year we set our sights even further and travelled into space in what can only be described as a truly out of this world campaign.“Scotland is Out of this World offered the opportunity to delve into the past and celebrate the country’s contribution to space exploration and its ancestral links to one of the greatest moments in history.“The new trail reveals some of the country’s stellar attractions and locations to visit to firmly cement Scotland’s place in astro-tourism. “After all, our best views aren’t confined to our awe-inspiring landscapes but reach up high into the night sky above as well.”Ohio-born Neil Armstrong was proud of his Scottish heritage.

Armstrong took “one giant leap for mankind” when he became the first person to walk on the moon.Three years after that historic moment, the Ohio-born NASA astronaut who commanded Apollo  took another “small step” into the history books in Langholm, the ancestral home of Clan Armstrong.There, in the “Muckle Toon”, he became the first and only person to be awarded the freedom of the burgh.Accepting the honour, he told the audience: “It’s said that the most dficult place to be recognised is in one’s own home town.

its new tennis-focused proposals.Inverurie Community Council has submitted fresh expansion plans to Aberdeenshire Council on behalf of Garioch Sports Holdings.Full planning permission was secured last year for a major extension of the Inverurie facility, but changes in the community’s requirements and pressures on funding have prompted a reduced development.Initially the plans would have seen the Burghmuir Drive centre expanding into one of the largest amenities of its kind in Scotland, incorporating tennis courts, a multi-sports arena, fitness suites and an all-weather G pitch for Inverurie Loco Works FC which has now been dropped.But while the scale of the expansion might not be as ambitious, the new plans do reveal tennis courts and improvements for fitness along with an Early Learning Centre for younger children.Thanks to signicant input from Judy Murray – mother of tennis stars Andy and Jamie – the plans feature three dedicated tennis courts and the centre has committed to a three-year partnership with the JM Foundation, highlighting the commitment of the centre to develop the sport across Garioch.The centre and JM Foundation will work in partnership in upskilling their workforce and identying potential coaches while funding coach education.In a supporting statement the centre writes: “The matter of securing the appropriate funding for the ious options which have been considered over the last couple of years has impacted upon how the plans have altered with the focus very much now being on the new tennis provision.“The most recent plans reflect the discussions with the Lawn Tennis Association and also Tennis Scotland.“The advice and guidance of Judy Murray has also been pivotal in how the plans particularly for the tennis courts have progressed.”The applicants also believe that despite the downturn in oil and gas and other industries, there is still a demand for its facilities.It reports: “As many of the activities and programmes now carry waiting lists, there is proof that despite a downturn in many industries the timing is now right to expand in tandem with the growth in participation and the increase in the town and rural residency.“An expansion of the present facility and delivery of its sporting, health and wellbeing activities has many positive additions as the market town itself strives to increase its provision to its residents.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\"

Aberdeenshire Council and the Scottish Executive with a definite potential for increased economic benefits which will impact favourably on local businesses.”Opened in December , Garioch Sports Centre is now one of the leading leisure centres in the North-east of Scotland.It boasts a wide range of indoor facilities including a four court games hall, two state-of-the-art squash courts and gym facilities, designated exercise studio, dance studio, community hall and conference room.Outdoor facilities include a full size FIFA-approved articial grass football pitch, home to over  teams, a m floodlit running track and five full size -a-side pitches.Earlier this year the centre objected to the creation of a privately-run gym in the town, warning of the detrimental effect it could have on its own users.Centre co-manager Kevin Bonarius said: “Granting approval for this development could affect the future viability of the GSC and place it under further pressure.”"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic","story":"The final section of the Aberdeen bypass is not expected to open until January.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Bypass sections to open on

Managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “HIAL’s commitment to access for all passengers has been recognised for a third year by the CAA, acknowledging the hard work by all our staff to ensure our airports are as inclusive as possible.#As an organisation, we work with local disability organisations and iniduals to ensure we are always improving our offerings to better meet their needs and provide assistance where required.“For Kirkwall to be listed as Very Good in its first year of reaching the required passenger threshold is a testament to the hard work staff put in to accommodate disabled and mobility restricted passengers.“Kirkwall has made several upgrades to its facilities for those with additional needs in recent years including changing the flooring in the security area from carpet to lino and adding additional counter space in disabled toilets.“We continue to invest and improve and will provide staff with additional disabilities training.#The CAA’s framework was introduced to ensure there is a consistent and high-quality service for disabled passengers across UK airports. The CAA assesses airports against a number of measures to establish how well they are performing for disabled passengers. Where airports regularly under-perform, the CAA can take enforcement action to ensure services are improved.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Lyon said HIAL is fully prepared for three days of industrial action, which will see six of its airports closed due to strike action by air traffic controllers.Kirkwall Airport will be shut to all traffic next Monday, July .The strikes were called following the rejection of HIAL’s latest offer on July . The offer rejected by Air Traffic Controllerscomprised a retention allowance that would have seen ATCOs benefit from an additional £, over a five-year period.Prospect presented a counter offer that signicantly exceeds the flexibility and affordability of a publicly owned organisation.HIAL says that, throughout this process, it has been committed to resolving this dispute and has submitted a number of proposals that have been rejected outright by the union.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s Managing Director said: “We deeply regret the inconvenience and upset to hundreds of passengers affected by the strike action.  We wish to find a resolution to this dispute as soon as possible and would urge Prospect to sit down with us once again to find some common ground on which we can arrive at a negotiated settlement.“Our position has been consistent throughout. We can only deliver an affordable settlement within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. So far Prospect has continued to ask for a pay increase far in excess of what we are able to afford and that unfortunately remains the situation.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute. Our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five year period remains on the table and will continue to explore potential solutions within our affordability.”“The continued industrial action is having a signicant impact on our passengers, communities and the airlines operating from our airports.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands.

Dame Judith told the committee she was ldquohugely encouraged by the scope of the consultation and that it stuck closely to the recommendations of her report.But she told the committee that momentum had been lost and added: ldquoWhilst itrsquos great that it is out there now, we have lost momentum and itrsquos an important statement of intent now, but we have really, really got to get on with it.When askedthe problem was that the Government had not committed itself to as tight a timetable as her review had she said ldquoyes, I think so.Dame Judith added: ldquoFor the people who matter at the heart of this process, this is hugely important and I think itrsquos really disappointing that we havenrsquot been able to move more quickly to give them the assurance that they needed that things really were going to change.But Housing Minister Kit Malthouse said that a ldquomassive amount of work had taken place including the ban on combustible cladding and work on remediation.

During their whistle stop tours of the land, much of the talk has, naturally, been about Brexit, our relationship with the United States and promises of tax cuts for iniduals and businesses.While these issues may capture the imagination of the , Tory party members, who are deciding who will be our next PM, there are plenty of other pressing matters that the next resident of No  Downing Street will need to keep in mind. Ensuring that everybody has access to a good workplace pension is one of them.As it stands, there are more people saving in a pension than at any time in our history. This is down to the success of auto-enrolment pensions – a policy that has welcomed some  million new pensions savers since .It has been a genuine success. So far. But there is more to do. Contributions from inidual workers and their employers have gradually been rising from a low base, reaching eight per cent of salary in April of this year.Monitoring how employees have responded to the April increase is crucial before any further tweaks are made to auto-enrolment policy.Westminster itself recognises the need for improvement. The  Auto Enrolment Review endorsed the case for making pensions contributions count from the first pound of salary, rather than anything after £,. This would have a material effect on the prospects of lower and middle-income workers building up a decent sized pot for retirement. But no timetable has yet emerged for implementation.Politics is in flux of course and commitments can fall by the wayside. But this delay is sensible. Auto-enrolment has worked so far because it has been evidence-based. It would also be important to stage gradually the implementation of a “contributions from the first pound earned” policy because of its greater impact on lower earners.More immediately, the government should consider measures to bring the benefits of auto-enrolment pension saving to more women.Women make up only around a third of those auto-enrolled so far. Reducing the “enrolment trigger” from £, a year from one job to the primary National Insurance threshold level – £, – would bring the benefits of auto-enrolment to another half a million people, three-quarters of whom would be women.This would help auto-enrolment play its full role in tackling the gender pensions gap. As things stand the average woman retires with a pension income £, less than her male counterpart. Women more often take a break from full-time work to raise a family, with a long-term knock on effect on their pension savings. More affordable and accessible childcare would help the four in  women who have said they would like to work more hourschildcare was more accessible.One bright idea is to encourage childcare businesses to open in town centres – a move which would help both Messrs Hunt and Johnson achieve their stated aim of “saving the High Street”.While I don’t believe for one second that either candidate will spend the coming days discussing the vagaries of auto-enrolment pensions, they will do well to remember that people really do need a guiding hand when it comes to securing their future.Gregg McClymont is head of policy at The People’s Pension and former shadow pensions minister.

The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form.

One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.IFLAS is a global hub of inquiry, teaching, and dialogue on enabling the transition to more fair and sustainable societies.All that is pure Mikey Mouse to a true Scientist!!!Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green . For women it is only .%. As for shades of green —- no chance for men !Maybe that’s one of the reasons why some of themcan’t resist verbal battles.Green for GO and they can’t stop . 🔴Thanks to Brian for those interesting links. The second, albeit straight from a professor in the field, might also not pass Ian’s test, but both seem to provide plenty of evidence it is more than reasonable for the kids to be concerned.  If we can agree this as a reliable source it might then be possible to make more progress on whether the kids actually are right, and or have a right, to be concerned.The clue to where their bias lies is in the name #statutory Committee for Climate Change# not climate science or climate research but climate#change#Nigel Farage will save the world.I have never claimed the children have no right to feel concerned, just that school strikes are a pointless, stupid action endorsed but fools and the politically motivated, that is my opinion no more no less.Relax kids! Theres no proof of climate crisis worldwide, says self-proclaimed “true Scientist” Ian Tinkler, yet our national climate scientic advisors think there is. Who is right  Hint, Ian hasn’t shared where he gets his reliable info.The government listens to an armsindependent body of expects established by law because it knows there is a problem. Ali, however, spies a plot con. Some of Ali’s previous alien-culture ideas have been shown to be a little further to the right than those most Tories admit to, so we can but guess where he gets them from.John and Ian have both recently had a pretty extreme go at climate protestor Greta Thunberg. They, with Ian, are strongly pro-Brexit. There is a possible common connection  cause. The far-right internationally have begun to target Greta whilst denying the dangers of global warming. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read thearticle “Germany’s AfD turns on Greta Thunberg as it embraces climate change denial” from June th.The AfD is a extremist far-right racist party which democrats should oppose. The article ends by warning that far-right extremists are using troll armies to stir up hatred, distrust and anger.Whoop, whoop. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read the .

This, she says, will leave her struggling to make ends met.Following their benefits blunder, the department now plans to take the money from Mrs McLaughlin’s existing benefits, which she depends on to survive.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mrs McLaughlin told how she felt like she had “committed a crime” during her PIP assessment.“When I went for the PIP assessment I went to Citizens’ Advice to help us out and a girl came along to represent me,” she said.“She was talking me through it outside because I got myself up to high doh over it.“When I went in the pressure just got the better of me. I was being asked questions and some of them I found hard to answer. I answered to the best of my knowledge, but I felt asI had committed a crime and I was in front of a  of judges.”Despite winning her appeal, she must now pay back £. per month out of her already meagre benefits. As well as the impact on her mental health, Mrs McLaughlin said she will “struggle” just to make ends meet.“The only thing we had to live off was ESA, which was only £ between us,” she said.“Why are they sending us this letter a year later saying that we have to pay the money back  It came as a complete shock. I rang and explained the circumstances, but I was just told that I have to pay it back by law. I understand that they gave us the money to pull us through, but why did they leave it for a year and let it mount up  At the end of the day the fault lies with them, but we are the ones being penalised. She put me onto a debt management line and I was toldI didn’t agree to pay it then they would start taking it out of my benefits anyway because my money comes from them.“We’re trying to run a house, we have oil and food to pay for, we don’t have a car but we have buses and taxi fares to pay for too. It puts me under a lot of pressure. I was trying to work out what it’s going to cost me and it’s going to take over a year and a half to pay it. I don’t know how I’m going to afford it. I received a letter a few months ago about going back to work. I can’t start work due to my health issues, and I only have another year left on my ESA – I have to re-appeal that. I don’t knowI’m going to get it back or not, so how am I going to make these payments ”She added: “I was only starting to relax and feel a bit better lately. I’m on a lot of medication for it. This has put a lot of pressure on me. I was in a complete state over this letter, but there’s nothing I can do – they’re going to take the money anyway.”A spokesperson for the Department for Communities, said: “Welfare Supplementary Payments are available to existing Disability Living Allowance claimants who experiences a loss of benefit following a reassessment to Personal Independence Paymenthowever depending on a person’s circumstances they may be entitled to more than one type of WSP arising from loss of DLA.“Claimants who do not qualy for PIP and subsequently successfully appeal the decision receive Welfare Supplementary Payments equal to the weekly rate of their previous Disability Living Allowance payments. In the event of a successful appeal and in line with the legislation the Department carries out an adjustment on any arrears due to ensure that an overpayment does not occur hence the claimant does not lose out financially.“However, in some circumstances e.g. where a WSP is paid for loss of a Carers Premium the legislation does not provide for an offset process to allow arrears of Carers Allowance benefit to be adjusted following a successful PIP appeal. Instead all arrears of Carers Allowance must be paid to the carer and recovery of the overpayment of the WSP sought from the person who actually received it however again in these circumstance neither the claimant nor the carer has lost out financially.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rte to broadcast glenanne film","story":"RTÉ is to broadcast a documentary by a West Belfast film-maker about the notorious loyalist Glenanne Gang, believed to be responsible for over  sectarian killings of Catholics during the Troubles, mainly in counties Armagh and Tyrone.Unquiet Graves will air next week, July  at .pm.The Glenanne Gang, which also contained members of the legal British Army UDR among its number, was also responsible for the Dublin-Monaghan bombings which killed  civilians in May , as well as the Miama Showband massacre in .Seán Murray’s film– which is narrated by the Oscar-nominated actor Stephen Rea – has previously been shown at An Chultúrlann and at the Movie House cinema in Belfast.Murray tweeted: “I can now announce that Unquiet Graves will be screening on RTÉ  on Monday the th of July at .pm. “This is of immense importance to the #Glenanne families# and is a major milestone on the road to justice.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38334275.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/download.jpg","title":"razor blades placed on belfast cycle path","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester. Following her death on July ,  she was buried there. Bessie bequeathed a total of £, s d to her two sons, Leslie Norman Ross and Arthur Gordon Ross, who were both doctors.A third son, George Harold Ross was born on May ,  in Derry. George was educated at Campbell College in Belfast and began a career in banking after emigrating. He enlisted in the th Canadian Battalion at the rank of Liuetenant on November ,  and later transferred to the th Canadian Battalion.  He saw action at the Somme in July,  and in April,  at Vimy Ridge where he was wounded and suffered injuries to his left femur and left foot. He was demobilised in July,  and ed to Canada where he became a farmer.CAPTION: The Reverend Robert William Ross."},{"url":null,"title":"derry university group says opportunity lifetime north west must seized","story":"The Derry University Group say that civic society has a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity to build a new, dedicated university in the North West.A spokesperson for the group told the Derry News: “This is the opportunity of a letime. There is currently, after years of campaigning, a genuine momentum of support building in Dublin and in London for a new university here.“We need to harness this carefully and creatively, to deliver a standalone Higher Education institution for our city region.“There is a real chance to redress  years of isolation and alienation and to build hope and prosperity for future generations in northwest Ireland.“We must be careful not to be side-tracked into short-term fixes as we have been before. We have an opportunity here to create a legacy that will endure for centuries.”The spokesperson added that the North West must immediately begin revising its current ‘tenuous’ development plans so as to accommodate a new university.“It is a matter of great concern that so much of this region’s future planning centres on promises made by Ulster University, an institution controlled in Belfast and Coleraine, which has consistently failed Derry and northwest Ireland – and has broken promise after promise to this city - over the past six decades.“As regards the long-term planning of the region, it is not acceptable that we do build and deliver our own alternative. Derry and the North West have the capability, the determination and the vision to deliver a better future for ourselves.“It is reckless and perilous to remain entirely dependent on outside institutions that will always, by necessity, serve their own interests and those of their friends first. Why should we continue to acquiesce to those who have failed us, misled us and ultimately alienated us over six dferent decades ”The spokesperson added that a new Derry-centred institution, with a cross-border element under the auspices of the National University of Ireland, could help militate against the impact of Brexit.“Derry Strabane Council needs, as its first priority, to re-draft its City Deal to ensure that it can include a new independent university as its new anchor partner.“Council also needs to engage pro-actively with the Dublin and London governments to enact supporting legislation, and to secure resources, funding other support and accreditation for this new dedicated institution for the North West.“The positive momentum is there. This is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss. We have a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity and build a new, dedicated university in the North West.”The Derry University Group, which is based at Ráth Mór, was established in  by Conal McFeely, Diane Greer and Garbhan Downey.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"eamonn mccann derry treated contempt nationalist leadership","story":"By Eamonn McCanngoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe neglect of Derry on both university education and rail links has been blamed for  years on sectarian unionism.There is a great deal of truth in this - but it’s not the whole truth.The same neglect has continued under politicians wearing green jerseys.It is half a century since unionism held sway in these parts. Since then, we have had Nationalist MPs, MLAs, MEPs, councillors, ministers and whatnot.

If it hadn’t been for the Derry University Group, the need to look beyond Ulster University for proper third level provision wouldn’t be on the agenda.Derry needs to take a more radical view.The lands and finances of Magee should be detached from UU and used as a foundation key for building a new university for Derry. Derry is already not just a walled city but a world city.A Derry university freed from the shackles of UU would attract students and academic talent from around the world.Pleading for a medical school in terms which suggest that that’s all we want falls far short of what’s needed. We need transformation. That’s not going to happen without a stronger, bigger, more determined movement for change.UU shted , students from Jordanstown into overcrowded Belfast - without any consideration of transferring some of the departments concerned to Derry.In fact, Derry wasn’t even considered.

The committee was headed by Lockwood, who was an English academic. He produced a report on a second university for Northern Ireland he recommended not Londonderry but Coleraine.“Runner-up to Coleraine was the city of Armagh. It was not a sectarian decision it was made by an impartial English academic. It is slanderous to suggest that he was sectarian.”However, alluding to successive decades of underinvestment Mr Adonis yesterday told the Derry News: “No matter what the motives behind these decisions were, the result is that Derry has unfairly lost out and its young people deserve better.“The past should not govern the future. Yet the situation is getting worse not better.”Figures gathered by the Derry News under Freedom of Information legislation, and published last month, show that student numbers in the city actually fell from , in   to , in  .This comes at the same time UU created a new and much larger campus in Belfast city centre at a cost of £-m. The university has attributed a reduction in student numbers and “expansion challenges” in Derry to higher education budget cuts.At Monday’s debate, Baroness OLoan defended Ulster University’s position insisting that the building infrastructure at Jordanstown was not capable of being sustained leaving it with no option but to relocate.UU’s decisionWhile, Lord Empey, a former leader of the UUP, and Minister responsible for further and higher education who dealt with Ulster University at somesaid he supported the proposition of a medical school in Derry.However, he added that the decision of where to invest was down to the university alone and UU “made very clear to us what it wanted to do. It said: we want to rebuild our Jordanstown campus and put it in the centre of Belfast. Will you support us or not “It was not a question of Londonderry versus Belfast—that option was not open. It had made its decision.”Meaningful change can be brought about as a result of this report which, Mr Adonis says, is a signicant first step towards increasing student numbers in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a new university with its principal campus in Derry - \"I hope action will follow,” he added.“It is realistic to believe that Derry can have a standalone university since it is the norm for cities the size of Derry across the UK to have universities of their own. Derry is unusual only in being so acutely disadvantaged. It is scandalous that this issue was not addressed years ago.”Askedhe will continue to advocate on Derry’s behalf, he added: “Absolutely! I will follow the government’s report in September closely and continue to push for Derry to have a university with its principal campus in the city.

What an emotional start to the event, and it only got better from there.”Mr Bamber also praised Rory McIlroy’s brave attempt to claw his way back into contention on the second day, after suffering a nightmare start to the tournament.“Everyone was willing Rory to make the cut, but sadly it was not to be,” he added. Finally, the euphoric scenes as Lowry strode onto the th green on Sunday was the cherry on top of the tournament for Mr Bamber. He added: “Overall, I think it was one of Ireland’s greatest ever sporting events, and one that brought people from both north and south of the border together. “It became a -county support for Shane by Sunday.”The Open: Businesses will fully grasp opportunities, says Tourism NI chief Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"And while he welcomed the huge immediate boost for the local economy, Mr Bamber added: “Perhaps even more signicant is the fact that our little part of the world was showcased to hundreds of millions of homes across the globe.“I firmly believe you will find more and more people saying NI is a must-visit location, not just for golf. “People will have seen the beauty of the north coast, and I just can’t see how we are not going to have an ongoing legacy from all this.“What we have had on our hands in Northern Ireland, particularly in north Antrim, has been a like a giant sleeping. That giant is now wide awake. We have shown ourselves to the world.”Meanwhile, secretary manager of Royal Portrush Wilma Erskine – who is often credited as the driving force behind The Open ing to the Dunluce Links – said the event had been “a fairy tale”.try catch  TrendingThe th Open Championship -

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
