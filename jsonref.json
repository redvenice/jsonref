Police pooch balances...Share this articleNeither have I. They may look like ordinary salted crisps, but the smell — eau de toilet cleaner — and the taste, like licking a forest floor, are anything but.There is nothing moreish, appealing or even palatable about them. A sixth of a pack contains nearly 9g fat, 12 per cent of your recommended daily intake — so they’re very unhealthy, too.REPULSIVE RATING: 55BRUSSELS SPROUTS PIZZA£5.25, Co-op stores          If you ignore the fact that it’s topped with all the bits of Christmas dinner nobody likes, this isn’t a bad optionWHAT THEY SAY: For those who think eating Christmas dinner off a plate is passe, why not eat it off a pizza base instead? This pizza (pictured above) is made with hand-stretched Italian sourdough and ‘delicious, festive-inspired flavours’.What this boils down to is shredded Brussels sprouts, chestnut puree and cranberry and port chutney, as well as mozzarella, pancetta and tomato sauce.The limited-edition ‘pizza natale’ (Christmas pizza) from the Co-op’s premium Irresistible range serves two and packs a hefty 513 calories per portion.TASTE TEST: If you ignore the fact that it’s topped with all the bits of Christmas dinner nobody likes, this isn’t a bad option.The sprouts have been roasted and shredded so finely that even sprout-haters like me would struggle to identify them, while the chestnuts and ham are a nice balance of sweet and salty. The base crisps up well — and cooks in only 12 minutes.REPULSIVE RATING: 25PIGS-IN-BLANKETS TEA£1 for 20 teabags, sainsburys.co.ukWHAT THEY SAY: There’s very little information on this bizarre product other than that it can make a lovely stocking filler.But who on earth wants a steaming, sausage-flavoured cuppa? Not me.Mercifully, at least there’s no pork — or any meat — in the tea itself. Instead, it’s a blend of lapsang souchong, apple pieces, sage and rosemary.          The aroma is like week-old roast dinner, wafting out of my mug in meaty wavesTASTE TEST: I love pigs in blankets. And tea. But putting them together in one product is not a winning combination.The aroma is like week-old roast dinner, wafting out of my mug in meaty waves, while the taste is what I imagine to be the flavour of smelly feet.REPULSIVE RATING:55CHRISTMAS PUDDING CHEESE£2.50 for 200g, tesco.com          It’s incredibly sweet — there’s a generous portion of raisins, ginger and peel — but perhaps too much ‘pudding’ and not enough ‘cheese’, as I can barely taste the StiltonWHAT THEY SAY: This truckle of white stilton, shaped like a Christmas pudding with wax ‘icing’, contains raisins, crystallised ginger, candied orange peel and rum.It’s a nice idea but badly executed: they seem to have taken a black-waxed Stilton, added a layer of white wax — and adorned it with a crude sticker of some holly. A six-year-old could’ve done it better. Dark rum goes well with hard crystalline cheeses, such as gouda, but mixing it with crumbly stilton is a peculiar first.TASTE TEST: The stench of alcohol hits me the moment I cut the truckle (pictured right) and that’s pretty much all I can taste. It’s incredibly sweet — there’s a generous portion of raisins, ginger and peel — but perhaps too much ‘pudding’ and not enough ‘cheese’, as I can barely taste the Stilton.REPULSIVE RATING: 35MINCE PIE MARTINI£10 for 35cl, Marks \u0026amp Spencer storesWHAT THEY SAY: M\u0026ampS have been bringing out unusually flavoured Christmas spirits for years, some more successfully than others.The mince pie martini, designed to be shaken and served over ice, is infused with all the flavours of a festive pastry.It’s essentially mulled wine — but, at 20 per cent alcohol by volume, twice as potent.The ingredients list doesn’t contain gin (the usual boozy component in a martini), but simply ‘alcohol’, diluted with ‘demineralised water’.TASTE TEST: Distilling buttery pastry and juicy mincemeat into a glass is no mean feat, and I’m rather sceptical.What pours out of the opaque bottle is a caramel-coloured liquid. The first sip is overwhelmingly alcoholic but it goes down easily (far too easily, actually), and I’m left with a lovely aftertaste of Christmas spices.A hit if you’ve got a sweet tooth.REPULSIVE RATING: 05MARMITE SPROUTS£1.50 for 400g, iceland.co.uk          As a devout sprout-sceptic and lifelong Marmite-hater, these are a double whammy of disgustingnessWHAT THEY SAY: These frozen sprouts, intended to push the much-maligned veg to a younger generation, come with pellets of Marmite-flavoured butter.They can be pan-fried in 12 minutes and supposedly have a ‘unique flavour profile that is a combination of umami, salt and yeast.’Food technologists at the supermarket say this boosts the taste by making the sprouts sweet and suppressing their bitterness.TASTE TEST: As a devout sprout-sceptic and lifelong Marmite-hater, these are a double whammy of disgustingness.The pros — the sprouts are easy to cook, stay firm and keep their vibrant green — are vastly outweighed by the cons, including the unpleasant salty taste, the bitter aroma that fills my kitchen, and the soggy puddle of brown butter that congeals around the pan.REPULSIVE RATING: 45GINGERBREAD STUFFING BALLS£3.30 for 12, Co-op stores          The chunks of apricot are too big and the ginger flavour so pungent that my eyes waterWHAT THEY SAY: I had high hopes for these gingerbread and apricot stuffing balls, which come from the same ‘Irresistible’ range as the Brussels Sprouts Pizza.They’re made from outdoor-bred Hampshire pork (which makes up a not-too-shabby 69 per cent of each ball), mixed with ginger puree and dried apricot, as well as sage, parsley and cinnamon.TASTE TEST: The first bite is pleasant enough — succulent and packed full of herby flavour — but it quickly gives way to an unexpected sweetness.The chunks of apricot are too big and the ginger flavour so pungent that my eyes water. These would be more at home on a dessert platter.Repulsive rating: 45FESTIVE YORKSHIRE PUDDING WRAP£7.99 for 800g, lidl.co.ukWHAT THEY SAY: This is the Frankenstein’s monster of festive food, comprising an entire Christmas dinner — turkey, sausage, gammon and pork, sage and onion stuffing — sandwiched inside a rather stodgy Yorkshire pudding.The box suggests it serves six, but it’s tempting to pick it up in your hands like a giant burrito and scoff the lot.TASTE TEST: Despite two hours, 15 minutes in the oven, the Yorkshire pud is soggy and sodden with oil. The sausages are an unappetising grey colour and I can’t tell the many different meats apart. The nutritional information is the stuff of nightmares: each serving contains a third of your recommended daily intake of salt.REPULSIVE RATING:45GIN AND ORANGE CHEESE£13 for 1kg, Waitrose deliWHAT THEY SAY: This huge slab of Yorkshire Wensleydale is a proper indulgence, weighing half as much as my turkey.It’s creamy, crumbly and studded with caramelised orange, as well as being infused with dry gin from an award-winning family distillery.TASTE TEST: Perfect if you’ve got cheese-loving guests coming over. It’s worth keeping an eye on the best-before date, though: mine expires on December 21.It tastes smooth, mellow and nicely tangy, thanks to the orange peel. The gin is unnecessary, though I’d rather have booze with my cheese than in it.REPULSIVE RATING: 25GLITTERY GINGERBREAD GIN LIQUEUR£12.00 for 50cl, asda.com          Looks more like a perfume bottle than a spirit, and the glitter tends to settle at the bottom until it’s shaken through the ginWHAT THEY SAY: Sparkling with pearlescent edible glitter, this over-the-top liqueur is made by combining premium gin with ginger and cinnamon.Asda hopes it will become a staple at festive parties, with serving recommendations including drinking it straight (hic) or adding it to a glass of fizz.TASTE TEST: Looks more like a perfume bottle than a spirit, and the glitter tends to settle at the bottom until it’s shaken through the gin. It’s perhaps a little tacky, but it can’t be faulted for lack of sparkle.The smell does everything it says on the tin, but the flavour is pretty insipid.REPULSIVE RATING: 25CARAMEL AND COCOA TORTILLAS£1.90 for 190g, tesco.comWHAT THEY SAY: Tesco’s new festive nibbles finally catch up with the sweet-and-savoury trend of five years ago.They’re made from maize flour tortillas, rolled up and dotted with dark chocolate nibs, then dusted with salted caramel seasoning.TASTE TEST: Neither sweet nor savoury, nor particularly crisp, nor even that interesting, these are no match for crisps and dips.I can’t work out whether they’re supposed to be eaten before a meal or after — and the caramel ‘seasoning’ gives them the distinct whiff of stale cinema popcorn.REPULSIVE RATING:45SALTED CARAMEL CHEESE£1 for 90g, asda.comWHAT THEY SAY: Competing for the crown of ‘most ridiculous Christmas cheese’ is Asda’s Wensleydale with salted caramel and white chocolate.Both Waitrose and Morrisons have flavoured Wensleydale with salted caramel before, but this takes it one saccharine step further, with fudge pieces and white chocolate chips.TASTE TEST: This is the smallest wheel of cheese I’ve ever seen, and once you take the wax off there’s even less to go around. This is no bad thing — one small bite is enough for me, and I can’t find any other takers.The taste is just as strange, syrupy and downright disgusting as I expected. When, or why, anyone would ever want to eat this is beyond me.REPULSIVE RATING:55 "},{"url":null,"title":"Australian PM praises Theresa Mays resilience determination Brexit","story":"    Theresa May revealed she called for a credible and transparent investigation into the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi          The Prime Minister said she reiterated the need for those responsible to be \u0027held accountable\u0027 during a sit down with Mohammed bin Salman at the G20 summit in Argentina          Mrs May sported a stern expression as she sat down with the Saudi royal yesterday in Buenos Aires - the prince\u0027s first significant appearance overseas since the killing.Speaking at the end of the G20 summit, Mrs May also said she was determined to deliver on the EU referendum result.\u0027The next nine days are a really important time for our country leading up to the vote on this deal,\u0027 she told her closing press conference.\u0027I will be talking with Members of Parliament obviously and explaining to them why I believe this is a good deal for the UK.\u0027Why it is a deal that delivers on Brexit but it is also a deal that protects jobs and the economy and why passing this deal in the vote that takes place in the House of the Commons will take us to certainty for the future, and that failure to do that would only lead to uncertainty.\u0027What I\u0027ve been hearing here at the G20 is the importance of that certainty for the future.\u0027Asked if this could be one of her last overseas trips as Prime Minister, Mrs May said: \u0027There is a lot more for me still to do, not least delivering on Brexit and being the Prime Minister that does take the United Kingdom out of the European Union.\u0027It comes after Mrs May was warned by Japan\u0027s Prime Minister to avoid a no-deal Brexit amid warnings from the country\u0027s car manufacturers.Shinzo Abe made the appeal to his British counterpart during talks at the G20 summit in Argentina, as Mrs May looks for partners to help her deliver the promised trading benefits of Brexit. It follows warnings from Honda and Nissan that their UK operations would face huge extra costs and bureaucracy in the event of a cliff-edge Brexit in March 2019.Earlier Britain\u0027s PM spoke to Australian leader Scott Morrison who praised Mrs May\u0027s \u0027resilience and determination\u0027 on Brexit and signalled a new trading relationship could be on the cards.            Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May and Japan\u0027s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shake hands during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires on Saturday.

The prince is at the summit but denies any knowledge of or involvement in Khashoggi\u0027s death.  World leaders did have a brief moment of unity early on Sunday as tributes poured in for former U.S. President George H.W. Bush who died on Friday evening. Mr Trump hailed his predecessor, saying he had \u0027inspired Americans\u0027 with his \u0027essential authenticity, disarming wit, and unwavering commitment to faith, family, and country\u0027. Vladimir Putin joined the tributes, saying: \u0027A distinguished man has passed away.

Pictured: Mr Abliz praying at his home in IstanbulThey believe the program is aimed at coercing China\u0027s 10 million Uighurs into living secular lives like the Han majority. Anything erging from the party\u0027s prescribed lifestyle can be viewed by authorities as a sign of potential extremism - from suddenly giving up smoking or alcohol, to having an \u0027abnormal\u0027 beard or an overly religious name.Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Uighur homeland has been blanketed with stifling surveillance, from armed checkpoints on street corners to facial-recognition-equipped CCTV cameras steadily surveying passers-by. Now, Uighurs say, they must live under the watchful eye of the ruling Communist Party even inside their own homes.\u0027The government is trying to destroy that last protected space in which Uighurs have been able to maintain their identity,\u0027 said Joanne Smith Finley, an ethnographer at England\u0027s Newcastle University.            Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Uighur homeland has been blanketed with stifling surveillanceIn one photo provided by Ablikim Abliz of his uncle\u0027s family, an unknown man is seen standing next to them.Mr Abliz heard the Han Chinese man was part of a government homestay program meant to monitor his relatives and part of a broader crackdown on religious expression in China\u0027s far western region of Xinjiang.  The Associated Press spoke to five Uighurs living in Istanbul who shared the experiences of their family members in Xinjiang who have had to host Han Chinese civil servants. \u0027I think it\u0027s going to be a great relationship\u0027: Trump...Ex-Interpol chief who vanished in China amid corruption...Share this articleThese accounts are based on prior communications with their family members, the majority of whom have since cut off contact because Uighurs can be punished for speaking to people abroad.The Uighurs abroad said their loved ones were constantly on edge in their own homes, knowing that any misstep - a misplaced Quran, a carelessly spoken word - could lead to detention or worse. In the presence of these faux relatives, their family members could not pray or wear religious garbs, and the cadres were privy to their every move.

Mr Idris says his sisters were monitored as part of a government homestay programTensions between Muslim minorities and Han Chinese have bubbled over in recent years, resulting in violent attacks.The fierce government crackdown on broadly defined \u0027extremism\u0027 has placed as many as one million Muslims in internment camps, according to estimates by experts and a human rights group.Uighurs say the omnipresent threat of being sent to one of these centers, which are described as political indoctrination camps by former detainees, looms large in their relatives\u0027 minds when they are forced to welcome party members into their homes.Last December, Xinjiang authorities organised a \u0027Becoming Family Week\u0027 which placed more than one million cadres in minority households. Government reports on the program gushed about the warm \u0027family reunions,\u0027 as public servants and Uighurs shared meals and even beds.Another notice showed photos of visitors helping Uighur children with their homework and cooking meals for their \u0027families.\u0027   More than a million Chinese civil servants have been assigned to move into the homes of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities, spending weeks as uninvited guests.

It offers stunning views across London and has been used as a music and community venue since it was reopened following restoration work in 1988After certain financial difficulties, an Act of Parliament in 1900 created the Alexandra Palace and Park Trust. The Act required the Trustees to maintain the Palace and Park and make them \u0027available for the free use and recreation of the public forever\u0027.In 1935, the BBC leased the eastern part of the building from which the first public television transmissions were made in 1936. Alexandra Palace was the main transmitting centre for the BBC until 1956, when it was used exclusively for news broadcasts.Just six months after the transfer of trusteeship to Haringey Council, on 10th July 1980, the Palace caught fire for the second time. An area comprising the Great Hall, Banqueting Suite, and former roller rink together with the theatre dressing rooms was completely destroyed. Only Palm Court and the area occupied by the BBC escaped damage.Development and restoration work began soon after and the Palace was re-opened on 17th March 1988. It continues as a Charitable Trust administered by the London Borough of Haringey.Alexandra Palace has built a reputation as one of London\u0027s premier venues.

And when the request to use the atomisers was raised, the response was, well, a little sniffy.The source said: \u0027Apparently Meghan didn\u0027t like the smell of the chapel, which, as you would expect, is a little musty. It\u0027s not unpleasant at all, though. \u0027It just smells how you would expect an old building to smell. And that\u0027s something the Royal Family are particularly used to.Royal organist, 38, who played at Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding...¿Ladies and gentlemen, this is your King speaking¿:...Share this article\u0027Meghan wanted staff to go around with these atomisers, like spritzer guns, and spray the chapel with scent before anyone arrived.\u0027Royal Household staff stepped in and told her office politely, but firmly, that this was the Queen\u0027s Chapel and it simply wasn\u0027t appropriate. \u0027I don\u0027t believe they said no because they thought it could affect the chapel in any way. It was simply the principle of the thing.\u0027This is a place that has held royal weddings, funerals and even contains the Royal Vault.

But does the double-breasted MP have designs on an even grander address?I ask only because Rees-Mogg has been appointed as a trustee of Charlton Park, ancestral Wiltshire seat of the Earl of Suffolk.Jacob and his wife Helena already own a £5 million townhouse near Parliament and a 400-year-old Somerset mansion.

They may look like ordinary salted crisps, but the smell — eau de toilet cleaner — and the taste, like licking a forest floor, are anything but.There is nothing moreish, appealing or even palatable about them. A sixth of a pack contains nearly 9g fat, 12 per cent of your recommended daily intake — so they’re very unhealthy, too.REPULSIVE RATING: 55BRUSSELS SPROUTS PIZZA£5.25, Co-op stores          If you ignore the fact that it’s topped with all the bits of Christmas dinner nobody likes, this isn’t a bad optionWHAT THEY SAY: For those who think eating Christmas dinner off a plate is passe, why not eat it off a pizza base instead? This pizza (pictured above) is made with hand-stretched Italian sourdough and ‘delicious, festive-inspired flavours’.What this boils down to is shredded Brussels sprouts, chestnut puree and cranberry and port chutney, as well as mozzarella, pancetta and tomato sauce.The limited-edition ‘pizza natale’ (Christmas pizza) from the Co-op’s premium Irresistible range serves two and packs a hefty 513 calories per portion.TASTE TEST: If you ignore the fact that it’s topped with all the bits of Christmas dinner nobody likes, this isn’t a bad option.The sprouts have been roasted and shredded so finely that even sprout-haters like me would struggle to identify them, while the chestnuts and ham are a nice balance of sweet and salty. The base crisps up well — and cooks in only 12 minutes.REPULSIVE RATING: 25PIGS-IN-BLANKETS TEA£1 for 20 teabags, sainsburys.co.ukWHAT THEY SAY: There’s very little information on this bizarre product other than that it can make a lovely stocking filler.But who on earth wants a steaming, sausage-flavoured cuppa? Not me.Mercifully, at least there’s no pork — or any meat — in the tea itself. Instead, it’s a blend of lapsang souchong, apple pieces, sage and rosemary.

But putting them together in one product is not a winning combination.The aroma is like week-old roast dinner, wafting out of my mug in meaty waves, while the taste is what I imagine to be the flavour of smelly feet.REPULSIVE RATING:55CHRISTMAS PUDDING CHEESE£2.50 for 200g, tesco.com          It’s incredibly sweet — there’s a generous portion of raisins, ginger and peel — but perhaps too much ‘pudding’ and not enough ‘cheese’, as I can barely taste the StiltonWHAT THEY SAY: This truckle of white stilton, shaped like a Christmas pudding with wax ‘icing’, contains raisins, crystallised ginger, candied orange peel and rum.It’s a nice idea but badly executed: they seem to have taken a black-waxed Stilton, added a layer of white wax — and adorned it with a crude sticker of some holly. A six-year-old could’ve done it better. Dark rum goes well with hard crystalline cheeses, such as gouda, but mixing it with crumbly stilton is a peculiar first.TASTE TEST: The stench of alcohol hits me the moment I cut the truckle (pictured right) and that’s pretty much all I can taste. It’s incredibly sweet — there’s a generous portion of raisins, ginger and peel — but perhaps too much ‘pudding’ and not enough ‘cheese’, as I can barely taste the Stilton.REPULSIVE RATING: 35MINCE PIE MARTINI£10 for 35cl, Marks \u0026amp Spencer storesWHAT THEY SAY: M\u0026ampS have been bringing out unusually flavoured Christmas spirits for years, some more successfully than others.The mince pie martini, designed to be shaken and served over ice, is infused with all the flavours of a festive pastry.It’s essentially mulled wine — but, at 20 per cent alcohol by volume, twice as potent.The ingredients list doesn’t contain gin (the usual boozy component in a martini), but simply ‘alcohol’, diluted with ‘demineralised water’.TASTE TEST: Distilling buttery pastry and juicy mincemeat into a glass is no mean feat, and I’m rather sceptical.What pours out of the opaque bottle is a caramel-coloured liquid. The first sip is overwhelmingly alcoholic but it goes down easily (far too easily, actually), and I’m left with a lovely aftertaste of Christmas spices.A hit if you’ve got a sweet tooth.REPULSIVE RATING: 05MARMITE SPROUTS£1.50 for 400g, iceland.co.uk          As a devout sprout-sceptic and lifelong Marmite-hater, these are a double whammy of disgustingnessWHAT THEY SAY: These frozen sprouts, intended to push the much-maligned veg to a younger generation, come with pellets of Marmite-flavoured butter.They can be pan-fried in 12 minutes and supposedly have a ‘unique flavour profile that is a combination of umami, salt and yeast.’Food technologists at the supermarket say this boosts the taste by making the sprouts sweet and suppressing their bitterness.TASTE TEST: As a devout sprout-sceptic and lifelong Marmite-hater, these are a double whammy of disgustingness.The pros — the sprouts are easy to cook, stay firm and keep their vibrant green — are vastly outweighed by the cons, including the unpleasant salty taste, the bitter aroma that fills my kitchen, and the soggy puddle of brown butter that congeals around the pan.REPULSIVE RATING: 45GINGERBREAD STUFFING BALLS£3.30 for 12, Co-op stores          The chunks of apricot are too big and the ginger flavour so pungent that my eyes waterWHAT THEY SAY: I had high hopes for these gingerbread and apricot stuffing balls, which come from the same ‘Irresistible’ range as the Brussels Sprouts Pizza.They’re made from outdoor-bred Hampshire pork (which makes up a not-too-shabby 69 per cent of each ball), mixed with ginger puree and dried apricot, as well as sage, parsley and cinnamon.TASTE TEST: The first bite is pleasant enough — succulent and packed full of herby flavour — but it quickly gives way to an unexpected sweetness.The chunks of apricot are too big and the ginger flavour so pungent that my eyes water. These would be more at home on a dessert platter.Repulsive rating: 45FESTIVE YORKSHIRE PUDDING WRAP£7.99 for 800g, lidl.co.ukWHAT THEY SAY: This is the Frankenstein’s monster of festive food, comprising an entire Christmas dinner — turkey, sausage, gammon and pork, sage and onion stuffing — sandwiched inside a rather stodgy Yorkshire pudding.The box suggests it serves six, but it’s tempting to pick it up in your hands like a giant burrito and scoff the lot.TASTE TEST: Despite two hours, 15 minutes in the oven, the Yorkshire pud is soggy and sodden with oil. The sausages are an unappetising grey colour and I can’t tell the many different meats apart. The nutritional information is the stuff of nightmares: each serving contains a third of your recommended daily intake of salt.REPULSIVE RATING:45GIN AND ORANGE CHEESE£13 for 1kg, Waitrose deliWHAT THEY SAY: This huge slab of Yorkshire Wensleydale is a proper indulgence, weighing half as much as my turkey.It’s creamy, crumbly and studded with caramelised orange, as well as being infused with dry gin from an award-winning family distillery.TASTE TEST: Perfect if you’ve got cheese-loving guests coming over. It’s worth keeping an eye on the best-before date, though: mine expires on December 21.It tastes smooth, mellow and nicely tangy, thanks to the orange peel. The gin is unnecessary, though I’d rather have booze with my cheese than in it.REPULSIVE RATING: 25GLITTERY GINGERBREAD GIN LIQUEUR£12.00 for 50cl, asda.com          Looks more like a perfume bottle than a spirit, and the glitter tends to settle at the bottom until it’s shaken through the ginWHAT THEY SAY: Sparkling with pearlescent edible glitter, this over-the-top liqueur is made by combining premium gin with ginger and cinnamon.Asda hopes it will become a staple at festive parties, with serving recommendations including drinking it straight (hic) or adding it to a glass of fizz.TASTE TEST: Looks more like a perfume bottle than a spirit, and the glitter tends to settle at the bottom until it’s shaken through the gin. It’s perhaps a little tacky, but it can’t be faulted for lack of sparkle.The smell does everything it says on the tin, but the flavour is pretty insipid.REPULSIVE RATING: 25CARAMEL AND COCOA TORTILLAS£1.90 for 190g, tesco.comWHAT THEY SAY: Tesco’s new festive nibbles finally catch up with the sweet-and-savoury trend of five years ago.They’re made from maize flour tortillas, rolled up and dotted with dark chocolate nibs, then dusted with salted caramel seasoning.TASTE TEST: Neither sweet nor savoury, nor particularly crisp, nor even that interesting, these are no match for crisps and dips.I can’t work out whether they’re supposed to be eaten before a meal or after — and the caramel ‘seasoning’ gives them the distinct whiff of stale cinema popcorn.REPULSIVE RATING:45SALTED CARAMEL CHEESE£1 for 90g, asda.comWHAT THEY SAY: Competing for the crown of ‘most ridiculous Christmas cheese’ is Asda’s Wensleydale with salted caramel and white chocolate.Both Waitrose and Morrisons have flavoured Wensleydale with salted caramel before, but this takes it one saccharine step further, with fudge pieces and white chocolate chips.TASTE TEST: This is the smallest wheel of cheese I’ve ever seen, and once you take the wax off there’s even less to go around. This is no bad thing — one small bite is enough for me, and I can’t find any other takers.The taste is just as strange, syrupy and downright disgusting as I expected. When, or why, anyone would ever want to eat this is beyond me.REPULSIVE RATING:55 "},{"url":null,"title":"Expert advice DIY festive wreaths make neighbours green envy","story":"    Sarah Rainey Christmas wreaths from bottom left Clockwise - Larry Walshe, McQueen, Simon J Lycett, Nikki Tibbles (Wild at Heart), Scarlet \u0026amp Violet, Rob Van Helden and Lavender Green Flowers  The first step for all designs: start by covering your base - either straw or metal - in moss (left) or pine (right)Sprout pizza?

That’s clear with this wreath (£125, larrywalshe.com) studded with pine cones and baubles.‘This intersperses different textures, which stops it looking too gaudy,’ Larry explains. ‘The base is Norwegian spruce with eucalyptus and asparagus, and viburnum berries.’          Larry covers a metal ring with moss and leaves using florist’s wire (£3.99 for a 45-metre roll, amazon.co.uk). ‘Cut the foliage up. Don’t go too small you want natural pieces sticking out,’ he explains.On top, everything is decoration. ‘Twist the wire back into the base,’ he adds. If you’re hanging it on a glass door or window, use foliage to make a green ‘back’, wired into the base, he says. A fresh wreath should last at least three weeks. ‘Only use products that will last, such as dip-dyed or painted leaves,’ he adds.Larry is running wreath-making classes on December 5 and 9 in Chiswick, London (£85pp).STUDDED WITH SURPRISESAt first glance, this wreath by McQueens — which supplies five-star hotels — looks very traditional: pine, gold and a red ribbon. But on closer inspection, it’s anything but.Senior florist Andrea Bassoli topped blue pine leaves with artificial gold trees, pomegranates and mini succulents (cacti) dipped in glitter. He adds bonsai roots, pine cones and dried blue scabiosa flowers. ‘Go with the directional flow of the leaves,’ he says.    He uses a ready-mossed straw wreath ring (£1.95, amazon.co.uk) and florist’s wire. ‘You need a robust frame, or the wreath will lose its shape and things fall off,’ he says.For a more modern look, put the ribbon slightly to one side, Andrea says, and affix a twist of florist’s wire to the back for a ‘hook’.Bespoke wreaths from McQueens cost around £250. There are full-day classes in London, on December 3, 5, 7 and 8 (£295pp, mcqueens.co.uk)ECO-FRIENDLY EXTRAVAGANCEEvery element here (£425, simon lycett.co.uk) is biodegradable, recyclable or reusable — which matters to Simon Lycett, the florist behind the blooms at the weddings of Prince William and Kate, Prince Charles and Camilla and the Beckhams.‘I’ve tried to avoid glitter and plastic. Use home-grown ingredients,’ Simon says. He uses a wire wreath frame (from 50p at hobbycraft.co.uk) — ‘or make one from a pair of bent coat hangers’ — and covers it in moss: ‘Rake it off the grass.’          Cover the base using Christmas tree trimmings, attaching it with wire going clockwise. ‘Start at the top with stems pointing down,’ he adds. Decorate with dried fruit, crab apples, berries and rosehips, and baubles.‘If you’ve got children, skip the berries and add Quality Street sweets,’ he says.The silk ribbon, frame and baubles, can be recycled for next year. ‘Pull out all the wires and throw the rest in the compost heap,’ Simon says. ‘You can hang the mossed frame up in the garage and use it again.’ASPARAGUS FERNS AND BERRIESThis crescent-shaped wreath (£95, wildatheart.com) is by Nikki Tibbles Wild At Heart — which has done ornate floral displays for Kensington Palace, Chanel and Dior.‘This asymmetric design is a contemporary alternative,’ says head florist Ruth Warren-Steed.          It comprises autumn meadow flowers and seeds attached to one side of a 15-inch copper hoop (from £3, etsy.com).Ruth affixes scented pine, willow, asparagus fern, pine cones, copper strawflowers, protea heads (£10, amazon.co.uk) and berries.‘Use buds and dried flowers, such as poppy seed heads,’ says Ruth. You could cover half of the frame, which is ‘half the work’, and she also recommends that you ‘don’t get hung up on the classic ring. Let your imagination run wild’.POPS OF PINK AND PURPLEUnconventional colours — pink, purple, orange — make this wreath by Vic Brotherson, owner of Scarlet \u0026amp Violet (a favourite of Nigella Lawson and Kate Moss) stand out. On a wire frame covered in moss, Vic adds pine foliage, copper beech leaves, rosehip, heather and pink peppercorns. Vic recommends pine and cedar leaves, which last eight weeks, and adds them in bundles.          ‘Some of our clients have expensive front doors, so don’t want to use nails for hanging,’ Vic explains. ‘I run a ribbon from the wreath over the door and attach it to the letterbox on the other side. Nobody can steal it!’ Small wreaths from scarletandviolet.com cost £85 and large wreaths are £100.FRUIT \u0026amp NUTRob Van Helden, who decorated St George’s Chapel for Princess Eugenie’s wedding, says slices of apple, preserved oranges and nuts are ideal for wreaths.‘They’ll last all season and give a lovely scent,’ he says. Rob uses a straw frame (from £2.50, etsy.com) for a homemade look.          ‘I layer it with blue pine and pine cones. Then I add the fruit, nuts, cinnamon sticks and baubles, before tying it with a ribbon.’ Rob’s top tip is to arrange the elements in clusters, and to ‘know your door’ — on a navy door, for example, blue and copper colours work well.‘I also like one on a table, around a hurricane vase with a candle in it,’ he adds. Luxury wreaths cost around £250 at rvhfloraldesign.com.SCENT AND SPARKLERosemary and lavender are key to this design by Lavender Green Flowers, who created displays for Pippa Middleton’s wedding. ‘It gives your house a festive smell,’ says Maddie Dawkins.She binds moss on to a metal frame and adds pine, lichen, dried oranges, hydrangeas and pine cones in glitter spray (£4.50, amazon.co.uk). ‘You don’t want a perfect circle,’ says Maddie.          ‘Dry garden hydrangeas by hanging them upside down,’ Maddie says. ‘Preserve sliced citrus fruit on greaseproof paper by baking them for five hours at 80c.’ Spritz the back and sides of the wreath with water once a week.

His subsequent novels include Last Man in Tower and Selection Day, which tells the story of two brothers growing up poor in Mumbai and chasing cricketing stardom. Kamila Shamsie described it as a “finely told… moving and intelligent novel” and it will be reissued on 13 December ahead of a Netflix series based on the book, which will be released on 28 December.Selection Day is about a father who envisages a grand future in Indian cricket for his sons. Was it prompted by your love for the sport?No. Actually, it comes from something close to disgust with the way cricket is played in India. It’s often said that cricket and Bollywood are the two real religions of India, which unite people of all backgrounds, and there’s much truth to that.What is it that repels you about it?There’s always been a fair amount of money involved in cricket in India. But what has happened in the last two decades is that, ironically, this game that in some ways began in England and was, if you will, an aristocratic backlash against emergent industrial capitalism – that game has become the spearhead of the new Indian capitalism, in the sense that cricket is used to sell everything here, from mobile phones to consumer products like shampoo and soap.And all this is done illegally and it runs into the several hundreds of millions of dollars, if not more, each year. So this so-called gentleman’s game is now, to me, one of the world’s largest money-laundering operations masquerading as a Victorian gentleman’s game.You focus on the effect the sport has on two brothers. Why that plotline?The Indian Premier League has taken the commercialisation of the game to a new level. I was having lunch in Mumbai about five or six years ago with a businessman who was going to slums across the city and looking for talented young boys playing cricket. Historically, in India it was a middle-class sport, even an upper-middle-class sport. In the last couple of decades, there has been a democratisation of cricket this is the good part. Cricket has spread both away from the big cities and down the social hierarchy. S, so a lot of poorer boys are playing cricket and they tend to be more driven because they’re more desperate. This businessman was looking for boys to sponsor, on the understanding that if they made it in the IPL to play for Mumbai or for India, he would receive a substantial portion of their marketing and advertising revenues. So that is how the IPL in a sense created this book, because I followed him around and I then started a novel that way.You spoke to some of the boys. What did that tell you?It’s a monomaniacal upbringing where you have to play cricket and have to do well and life is quite rigidly regulated in terms of what they could eat, whom they can associate with. Usually, there’s a controlling parent, almost always a father.One of the boys, when I asked him about his mother, said: “Mummy has run away”, which initially made me laugh, because it seemed like a strange thing to say usually it’s the boy who runs away, not the mother. But often the controlling father is a pretty unpleasant person to live with, not just for the boys but also for his wife. So in more than a couple of cases, the boys have been living effectively with the father alone since they were quite young, and that allowed me to broaden the story out and do a larger exploration of some aspects of contemporary urban Indian masculinity.The White Tiger centred on a chauffeur who kills his employer and then creates a new life. What motivated you to write it?It began out of a question I have: whether a man could live on his own in India. Because life in India is so much more social, a human being’s life here is so enmeshed in social networks. And I was struck, more than 15 years ago, when a policeman told me that it was impossible for anyone to hide in India because sooner or later that man’s accent, his appearance, some aspect of the way he ate, would give him away. How one can be free and what price will have to be paid is how I see each story starting off.I must be very honest: my books are equally motivated by my desire to make a nuisance of myself. I have fewer and fewer subjects that I can pick on, because I’ve written about a few to annoy my Indian readers.Why do you think you want to be a nuisance?My mother used to say that she thought I had the wrong nervous system for India, because I get irritated. I hate being stared at, for instance. I can’t negotiate, I can’t bargain and she used to say she thought it was remarkable that her children should be born in India because all people here do is stare at you and they bargain. So I don’t have the right nervous system here and the books are in a sense an attempt to handle that and deal with it.What are you reading at the moment?I’m reading the poetry of a man named Kenneth Koch, an American poet who died a few years ago, and he taught me when I was a student at Columbia University. I’m reading a lot of contemporary poetry right now. I was going to start reading Adrienne Rich next.Which book or author do you always return to?I have books I always read when I’m writing, and one of them is Of Human Bondage by Somerset Maugham. It’s a book that always reminds me why I wanted to be a writer and what it is you want to avoid as you write. It’s very special because it’s so unlike anything else Maugham wrote.What else is on your reading pile?I do read manuscripts by younger writers that are sent to me, because I’m trying to help more talented young writers. One is by Keshava Guha and it’s called Accidental Magic.And are you working on another book right now?Yes, so in another a couple of years, maybe, it will come out. As I age – I’m in my mid-40s now – my thoughts are very much on what I can get done in the time I have. Because in a few months I will have outlived my mother and I never thought, as a boy, I would be older than she was when she died, so I don’t take it for granted that I have a large number of years ahead. I’m very much focused on what comes next and what comes after that. Each book is a battle now to see through the press and that’s good. It should be that way.

He never went inside – he doesn’t drink – but he noted its reliably heaving beer garden.These days, Khan is inside the building most days: six years ago he converted it into a halal butcher’s shop, which he runs with his son, Waqar. Instead of pints of bitter, the pair sell 3kg of keema (mince) for £10.50 and give out Indian sweets rather than peanuts to their customers.Khan thinks he knows why: “The smoking ban. I’ve been driving a taxi for 29 years and since the ban people don’t go out nearly as much. They think ‘sod it, I’ll stay at home.’”It’s a difficult claim to prove, at least when seeking reasons for the prolonged nationwide plunge in pub numbers. While the 2007 ban may have hurt pubs with a high proportion of keen smokers, other establishments will have welcomed new patrons who previously shunned smoke-filled rooms.And while the steepest national declines in pub numbers came in the two years that followed the smoking ban, this period also coincides with the deepest recession in living memory, when disposable incomes were squeezed until the pips squeaked.What is clear is that the factors at play in the decline of British pub culture are manifold.Craig Watson, who shut one of his two Hyndburn pubs, the Bay Horse, in October, blames corporate greed, particularly the “beer tie”.“It feels like everyone wants a piece of you. I’m tied to a brewery, which means I have to buy my drinks off them. Thwaites charges me £211 for 11 gallons of Strongbow Dark Fruits. I could get that for £120 elsewhere.”Watson is one of many publicans who complain that being tied to a pub company forces them to pay through the nose for beer. Despite legislation designed to make it easier to cut the tie, those who have tried the process say it is far too difficult and costly, often pitting one-man-band publicans against companies with deep pockets and hefty legal teams.This might also explain why the number of larger pubs has increased even as overall numbers have fallen. Big venues, often run by major pub companies, are better able to cope with punishing costs.“To survive, you need all the sports on TV,” says Watson. “Subscribing to Sky and BT sports costs me £1,000 a month. I don’t have a licence to sell food but people expect it, so I put on a free spread of pies and peas on a weekend to keep people in. Then there’s the entertainment – bands and singers. I probably spend £1,500 a month on that. We can turn over £7,000 in a week but it doesn’t leave a lot left over.”Business rates levied by the council are another major burden, costing him £7,000 a year.One reason for that is that the tax is based on “rateable value” – essentially what the premises would be worth in rent per year on the open market. Pubs, which can often be in desirable locations, have seen these values rise significantly without their income keeping pace.Nor can they mimic other business-rate payers in industries such as retail, some of whom have been able to offset the cost of running a bricks and mortar premises by selling products online.While supermarkets also pay the tax, they are able to keep costs down by subsidising beer prices with the margins they make on other products. Pubs cannot follow suit.The real ale group Camra, among others, has called for a lower rate of beer duty for pubs, as well as an overhaul of business rates.Tax makes a big impact on pubs in areas such as Hyndburn, where the average weekly pay of £378.80 is £70 below the national average.In the Warner Arms in Accrington town centre, David Pickup and Kim McMahon are enjoying pints of Tetley for £2.30. David is still reeling from a recent trip over the Pennines. “We went to Skipton, even though it’s in Yorkshire,” he says, pretending to spit on the carpet, “and two pints of bitter were £7.80!”After price, social and demographic change is a nebulous but crucial factor in the malaise affecting pubs.For instance, Watson bemoans noise complaints brought against him by a neighbour who also managed to silence the local church bells. “People are moving into areas near pubs that have been there for 100 years and complaining about being able to hear music on a Saturday night,” said Watson.In his surviving pub, the Victoria, he has installed a £2,500 air-conditioning system because he is not allowed to open the windows on summer evenings.Quite a few Hyndburn pubs are now curry houses: the Farmer’s Glory is now Anar Kali and the Rising Bridge Inn is the Spice Room.Jones also points to the rise of private landlords and the sell-off of social housing, which have led to the “collapse of communities” in inner urban areas by driving up living costs and making it harder for people to put down roots.“We’ve got transient areas with private-sector landlords. Communities have been broken up … The local pub is local to no one because no one is local.“Also, in the private rented sector, it is more likely to be people on exceedingly low incomes who will use the off-licence, not the public house.“Do we want to support off-licences or pubs? I know which I would want to tax more.”Spit-and-sawdust pubs are still out there if that’s what you’re looking for, but old-fashioned local drinking dens, perhaps patronised by a few regulars and a much-loved but ageing dog, are on the wane. As the number of pubs in Britain dwindles, those that survive tend to look a bit different.Community pubsOne way that people can fight back against their local succumbing to financial pressures is to defend it – with their time, effort and money. For instance, some communities have stopped local pubs being turned into flats by having them declared “assets of community value”. This triggers a moratorium on development that can allow interested parties – often a loose collaboration of locals – to raise the cash to take it over. In 2017, a report found that there were 50 co-operative pubs and 90 groups looking into setting one up.Large and chain pubsThe Economies of Ale report from the ONS revealed that while the overall trend was for decline, there had been a surge in the number of larger drinking venues, both independently owned and run by large companies with a nationwide portfolio of alehouses.Larger pubs may have higher fixed costs such as staffing and utility bills but, when run efficiently, allow owners to increase sales volumes and profits by significant amounts. With space for large tables they also skirt the borders of the restaurant trade. GastropubsNow a fixture of British life. Many urban and rural pubs serve award-winning food and most now offer some form of menu. Shifting social and family dynamics mean many pubs are less dominated by male drinkers and more likely to welcome family diners.There is also a financial incentive, in that so-called “wet-led” pubs, where boozing is the order of the day, rely on pretty thin profit margins. Margins on food tend to be much larger and deliver a huge boost to profits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d470298a364bf25cc9ab074f95b65b33a8eb8d35/70_930_2809_1685/master/2809.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cda3b31194239fa132c02cf6ad0c2b1f","title":"i know all about being bullied by rascists","story":"I cannot recall ever being “waterboarded”. But nor can I recall many days when, as a schoolboy, I did not return home without a bruised lip or a bloodied nose. Sometimes, I got a hiding at home too. “You should know better than to get into a fight.”Not getting into a fight was not, however, a choice in 70s Britain. Not if you were Asian in an age in which “Paki-bashing” was almost a national sport. You either stood up for yourself, and got into fights, or you got picked on even more.So when I saw the viral video of a 15-year old Syrian refugee, Jamal, being assaulted by a fellow schoolboy in a Huddersfield school, I felt more than shock and outrage. I’ve been where Jamal is and understand what he must be going through.The incident raises questions about attitudes to refugees. It raises questions, too, about the role of social media. It is just the latest in a series of racist confrontations caught on camera and exposed online. From a bigoted rant on a Croydon tram to racial abuse on a Ryanair flight, social media has helped bring attention to unacceptable behaviour. It can also distort perceptions. It is easy to regard such incidents as expressive of everyday life in Britain. One of the reasons they are so shocking, though, is that Britain has changed so much from the nation of my childhood.There was no such thing then as social media through which to expose racist bullying. But even if there had been, such incidents were so embedded in the social fabric that it’s doubtful they would have caused outrage or even been seen as newsworthy.Racism remains a problem and hostility to refugees is an issue that needs tackling. Jamal’s sister was apparently also abused at the same school, her hijab forcibly removed. It’s not just in Huddersfield that asylum seekers have faced brutal attacks. Nevertheless, such incidents are not characteristic of British society today in the way they would have been a generation ago.Social media exposure can also lead to people piling on to iniduals, including children. The alleged racist has received death threats and his family forced to leave their house. It’s easy to say: “He’s a racist, he deserves what he gets.” But however nasty the assault, do we really want to encourage the corrosive effects upon public space and civic life of social-media-driven mobs? Whether online or offline, it’s not just racists who are targets of such fury.We are witnessing, too, the emergence of a culture in which it is acceptable passively to record deplorable acts to share online rather than actively to intervene to aid the victims. One reason for this is the ubiquity of phone cameras. But social changes are important, too. A more atomised society and a safety-first culture have both helped blunt our sense of moral obligation to others. When a senior policeman thinks it acceptable to lock himself in a car rather than intervene in a terrorist attack on parliament, is it surprising to see the rise of what the defence minister, Tobias Ellwood, called the “walk-on-by society” in a Newsnight interview following the Huddersfield attack?In the Westminster terror attack, Ellwood showed great courage in trying to save the life of PC Keith Palmer, fatally stabbed by Khalid Masood. He has the moral authority to castigate the tendency of people to stand on the sidelines, but not to pronounce on attacks on refugees.‘Where does this bully get his ideas from?” Ellwood asked on Newsnight of the alleged schoolboy attacker. One can only gasp at his lack of self-awareness.Ellwood serves in a government led by a prime minister who, as home secretary, celebrated the creation of a “hostile environment” for migrants considered illegal. Her policy nurtured a climate of suspicion in which people were deemed guilty unless they could prove themselves innocent. It dragooned teachers and doctors and landlords to act as auxiliary immigration officers. It created an environment that incubated the Windrush scandal. And one that nurtures the hostility to refugees that sometimes spills over into violence.What is surprising is not that such attacks take place but that, given the political rhetoric about migration and the character of government policy, they are relatively infrequent. “It’s not the welcoming, friendly Britain we are supposed to be,” Ellwood wrote in a now-deleted tweet after the Huddersfield attack. If he wants to understand why, he should look closer to home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b409a5699da25f9de5a45c9ef9b888277eed22/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a6a8732eec767c06a64fbb511d5e31f","title":"sheryl sandberg lean out corporate feminism","story":"Capitalism has coopted feminism and become a way for privileged women to advance their careers. We say: enoughSay what you like about Sheryl Sandberg, you can’t deny that she’s leaned all the way in to Facebook’s unethical business practices!Facebook, as per usual, is currently facing a number of scandals of its own making. These include revelations that it hired Definers, a conservative PR firm, to discredit critics by leveraging antisemitic conspiracy theories about George Soros. Sandberg, who is Fakebook’s chief operating officer, initially distanced herself from the scandal. On Thursday, however, the New York Times published a report alleging Sandberg was far more intimately involved than she’d let on –\u0026nbspin fact, she had allegedly personally ordered research on Soros. According to the Times, Sandberg asked Facebook’s communication staff to look into whether the liberal billionaire had any financial motivations for criticizing the company. (Soros delivered a speech at the World Economic Forum in January where he called Facebook and Google “menaces”. )The Soros story is just the latest blow to Sandberg’s reputation, both as an executive and as a supposed feminist. Five years after Sandberg published Lean In, it would appear that capitalism’s favourite feminist has finally fallen from grace. She may not have been fired from Facebook (yet) but Sandberg is definitely no longer the chief operating officer of Feminism LLC.If this sordid story is good for anything, I hope it serves as a reminder that we need to push back against corporate feminism. Capitalism has coopted feminism and turned it into a way for privileged women to advance their careers and sell books. Ivanka Trump has written a “feminist” book, for God’s sake! Obviously, being a rich and successful woman does not make you a feminist. Fighting for all the equality of all women does. Having more women in powerful positions means nothing if all they’re doing is leaning into exploitative capitalist conventions. Sandberg is a very clear example of that.A new report by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research says women in the US earn 49 cents to men’s dollar. The report notes: “The commonly used figure to describe the gender wage ratio – that a woman earns 80 cents for every dollar earned by a man–understates the pay inequality problem by leaving many women workers out of the picture.”For example, it doesn’t take into account women who have temporarily left the workforce to care for their family. But don’t let this news dishearten you, ladies, just keep on leaning in!Tarana Burke, who founded the #MeToo movement in 2006, says the campaign has become unrecognizable.

In 1968 Chisholm became the first black woman elected to Congress, representing Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. In 1972 she became the first woman to seek the presidential nomination of a major political party – her campaign slogan was “unbought and unbossed.” Chisholm is certainly unforgotten: the New York mayor recently announced a monument to the Brooklyn badass will be installed in Prospect Park.

So what would she delete from her history? As she stars in Ralph Breaks the Internet, Silverman discusses 4chan, Trump and bad gags “I don’t forgo any important part of my life for being on the internet,” says Sarah Silverman. We are supposed to be talking in person but she’s stuck in traffic so we’ve started the interview over the phone, which is awkward – although we are talking about how much she looks at her phone, so maybe it’s appropriate. She doesn’t have any self-imposed rules about screen time, “but I’m pretty good at making things a treat. I don’t go crazy with any one thing. Even a cigarette: I’ll just have one once in a while.” She pauses: “I guess I shouldn’t say that because this is a Disney movie I’m promoting.” Shortly after this exchange, the phone line mysteriously cuts dead. A loss of signal? Or has she gone too far off-message for her Mouse House handlers? We will never know.No one could mistake Sarah Silverman for a children’s entertainer. Her Wikipedia page even has a subsection devoted to “Controversies”. Silverman’s brand of comedy is famously hard-edged, boundary-teasing, close to the wind-sailing, but told with a smile, a wink and a winning sense of silliness. Yet here she is in Disney’s family-friendly sequel Ralph Breaks the Internet, reprising her perky virtual video game character Vanellope von Schweetz. As the title suggests, she and the adorable lunk of the title (voiced by John C Reilly), are whisked from their offline amusement arcade backwater to this brave new thing called “the internet”, which the movie depicts as a bustling, regimented, perpetually sunny metropolis dominated by corporations such as Google, eBay and, of course, Disney. So, not far removed from modern-day Los Angeles.Understandably, Ralph Breaks the Internet does not stray into the more adult-oriented neighbourhoods of internet city, which is where you would find much of Silverman’s own output. She has a significant online presence, including 12.5 million Twitter followers and, currently, her web TV show I Love You, America. In the opening episode of that, Silverman took the old nerve-calming adage of “imagine your audience naked” one step further, and had an actual naked couple in the audience, whom she interviewed with regular, gratuitous closeups of their body parts. She has appeared on a chatshow dressed as Adolf Hitler. She went viral on YouTube with a song called I’m Fucking Matt Damon. She has regularly joked about rape, paedophilia and racism. If the internet were a city, Silverman’s crudeness could fill a mall.“Boundaries are the best thing for comedy in a lot of ways,” she says. “I mean, I fight them. I intrinsically don’t like to be told what to do because I’m a comic. I’m allergic to it. But those boundaries force you to have to find a new way. I like finding hard comedy in places that don’t hurt someone.”That is why her fans love her, but you can see how it might create certain challenges when it comes to promoting a wholesome, big-budget Disney movie (they needn’t worry, Ralph made more than $80m on its opening weekend in the US). When she arrives at our London rendezvous in person, she gives me a hug, apologises and sits on the floor. She is frank and engaged and exudes enough warmth to heat the freezing cold hotel room, although she keeps her coat on throughout. The coat is new: black, padded, full-length, like a wearable duvet. “I bought it for this trip. It was $200 and it’s kept me really warm, though the zipper’s not wildly strong.” Yes, she bought it online, but Silverman is no sucker for internet commerce. “I live in a small apartment and I don’t have much storage and so I can’t have things,” she says. To its credit, Ralph Breaks the Internet does acknowledge that the web is not all sunshine and kitten memes. As well as a story of friendship, growth and product placement, it serves as an introduction to modern online perils: inducements to consume, irritating pop-ups, violent games, abusive trolls and hurtful comments, the latter almost shattering Ralph’s love for the internet terminally. There is even a brief trip to “the dark web”.Beyond that, she also tries to zone out the daily churn of celebrity gossip. Typing her name into search engines on the morning we meet, the top two news items are “Sarah Silverman, 47, looks stylish in a corduroy mini skirt as she joins her co-star John C Reilly, 53, at Ralph Breaks the Internet premiere in Dublin” (Daily Mail, via Google), and “Sarah Silverman \u0026amp Jon Hamm Are Boning. Somewhere, Bill Maher Seethes With Envy” (thehollywoodgossip, via Bing).As for more garden-variety trolling, Silverman has learned how to deal with the mixed bag of online comments. Some are hateful, many are supportive, some are just plain weird (random Instagram sample: “I’m not gay, but I would deep-throat giant black cock for a chance to play basketball with Sarah Silverman”). “I kind of know, with my eye, how to scan through them now,” she says. “I also look at them when I’m in a ‘solid place’. It’s certainly not a thing to do when you’re feeling vulnerable, and yet a lot of people are drawn to doing that when they are because they want to validate themselves they want to read something that makes them feel worth being on this Earth. So you really shouldn’t read them unless you absolutely understand that you deserve love and have a place on this Earth. Because otherwise you’re fucked.”Nearly three decades in standup has thickened her skin, it seems: “As a comedian, trolls to me, I see them as hecklers. And what I’ve come to learn about hecklers is, whatever they’re yelling out, the subtext is: ‘I exist!’ Right? And that’s what I see on the internet. They want love. They go towards love. That’s why people join hate groups. They find family there. They find acceptance there. That’s why Trump has gone to the far right. People there go: ‘You’re amazing!’ They like him there. They see that they can manipulate him with love. Our governments are filled with people with daddy issues who don’t look inward, who have no perspective, who don’t live examined lives, and we’re all paying for it. You see that in trolls and in the rage on the internet. This is misplaced anger!”Silverman can be crude and irreverent but she is also, increasingly, unashamedly political, and surprisingly earnest about it. “I like being silly and funny and stupid, especially on Twitter, but I do feel a little responsibility to push out what I think is important information or true information, even though it’s not very funny, at a time where truth has not much currency. I don’t know if you know this, but Russia infiltrated our elections with the intention of causing chaos and turning our citizens against each other and that has exactly happened.” She is adopting an exaggeratedly serious tone now, folding the edges of her earnestness back into humour.She strikes a similar balance between political and goofy in I Love You, America, in which – ironically for a web-based show – she seeks to bridge ides through good old-fashioned real-life encounters, rather than aggressive, anonymous online ones. In each episode, she escapes her self-described “liberal bubble” and visits people she disagrees with: Trump-voting crab-fishers in Louisiana, for example, or a conservative Mormon family in Wyoming.This is another hazard of the internet age, especially for comedians such as Silverman: it is easier than ever to both cause offence and take offence. With a live standup show, there is context and nuance and intimacy online, anything perceived as contentious or off-colour will go straight into that “Controversies” section on Wikipedia. And it will stay there for ever. The latest entry dates from this October, in relation to her friend and fellow comedian Louis CK, whose career was derailed by revelations he had exposed himself and masturbated in front of women. Silverman was one of those women. In her case, it was consensual and non-exploitative, she stated, although she never condoned his actions. Inevitably, her comments were repeated, amplified and condemned.Does she ever wish she could just delete her online history? “Well no, because I think you have to learn from history, in macro ways and in micro ways, with your own history. So all I can do is learn from it, be changed for ever by it, and do what I can to make it right going forward.Part of that, she observes, is the internet making the world smaller. She says she likes to have her mind changed, which is something your rarely hear anyone say. “I think, as a comedian, if you’re not changing with the times – not just second-guessing what the kids want to hear but growing and changing as a human being, living an examined life – that will reflect in your comedy. You’ll lose fans and you’ll gain fans. That’s not up to me, but I just try to stay within what I think is cool and funny and interesting. If you can’t change with the times, you’re fucking old.”Ralph Breaks the Internet is in cinemas now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89d227ad6319e5d898469c45c8a0dbb8f68e37b9/0_128_3760_2256/master/3760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=457bdc5a15672502ad505ba0593a3eaa","title":"the lowdown on british columbia this canadian province is not to be missed","story":"With cosmopolitan cities nudging wide-open wilderness, spectacular wildlife and a superb culinary scene, British Columbia offers a host of amazing adventuresChefs around the world adore BC for its incredible produce, from sweet spot prawns, celebrated in a festival each year at Vancouver’s Fisherman’s Wharf, to the juicy Okanagan cherries and peaches, which locals devour by the crate.Start planning your trip by poring over online menus at stellar Vancouver restaurants such as chef Andrea Carlson’s Burdock \u0026amp Co Gastown go-to, French-influenced L’Abattoir or the upmarket west coast take at Botanist.

If parliament was in deadlock, Theresa May could get herself out of that deadlock by backing a second referendum.”Gyimah, who voted to remain in the EU in 2016, likened the negotiations to a football match in which the opposition “are the referee and they can make up the rules as they go along”.He added: “We all know more about the EU than we did during the first referendum and in particular the terms of our departure. I am happy to concede if we have a second referendum and if leave wins, at least we would do it with our eyes wide open.”The MP for East Surrey said he came to his decision after looking through the terms of the deal and receiving feedback from his constituents.He also cited May’s decision to give up on efforts to gain access to the EU’s Galileo satellite navigation system for defence and critical national infrastructure purposes after being frozen out by Brussels, which he has said was “a foretaste of the brutal negotiations we will go through that will weaken our national interest, make us poorer, less secure.”“We don’t actually have a deal, we have a deal in name only,” Gyimah said. “What we have is a series of principles of what we want to achieve as a country, a set of negotiations after we have left the EU and given up our voice, our veto and our vote.“We will have to deal with these consequences and the public would not forgive us if we don’t level with them on the difficult choices ahead.”Gyimah’s departure highlights the scale of the task facing May if she is to avoid a potentially crippling defeat in the Commons.The Democratic Unionist party, which has a confidence and supply deal with the Tories, has indicated it will not support May’s plan, as has the Labour party and many of the prime minister’s own MPs.Jo Johnson and Justine Greening, two former ministers, welcomed Gyimah’s suggestion that a second referendum was worth considering now May’s deal had been made public.“Like many MPs, he has recognised the huge shortcomings of the prime minister’s deal and the need to find an alternative path forward for Britain,” said Greening, a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign.However, the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, said he was sad to see Gyimah leave the government over Brexit.Wright acknowledged the agreement with the EU was not perfect, but said he believed it was the best one available.“All of my colleagues are going to have to make their own judgment about what they think about this deal,” he told the Today programme.“The negotiation we have had with the European Union was always going to be a matter of compromise for both sides. You do have to compare this deal with the realistically available alternatives.“Either we leave with no deal, which would have serious economic consequences, or we say to the British public: ‘I’m sorry you have got it wrong, you are going to have to do it again’, which I think would have serious democratic consequences.”Michael Gove – one of the leaders of the leave campaign – urged Tory Brexiters to get behind the agreement. In an article for the Daily Mail, he warned that Brexit could be “in peril” if the agreement was voted down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4ccdd19ba078adce54e9ef50ac2a60b118a1f0/0_193_3186_1911/master/3186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f822b9c84ec9001b0c130635a772d5b2","title":"rupert grint harry potter the line between ron weasley and me was thinner with each film","story":"The actor, 30, on being an introvert, peaking early and his desire to have kidsMy life has a very distinct before-and-after line. Before June 2000 I went to a normal state school and life was ordinary. My dad sold Formula One memorabilia and my mum made wedding cakes and looked after five kids. I was very grounded. When I got the part of Ron Weasley I left school straight away and things have never been the same.I was quite a shy kid and acting was always attractive to me because you could hide behind the character and be someone completely different. I did loads of school plays and fêtes, and I once dressed up as Mystic Meg.For the first few Harry Potter films I was living the dream. The reason I auditioned was because I loved the books. When I got to film three or four, I started to feel an overwhelming weight of responsibility because they were so phenomenally popular. The whole press and red carpet thing was an attack on the senses. I don’t excel in that kind of environment.I feared God as a kid. I went to a Hertfordshire Catholic school. The stories were very powerful and I took them all on board even though I’m from a very secular family. I knew I wasn’t one of them, but I was quite anxious and worried about religion and the dogma attached to it.There were definitely times when I thought about leaving. Filming Harry Potter was a massive sacrifice working from such a young age for such long periods and I definitely remember thinking during one extended break, ‘This whole thing is so all consuming, do I really want to go back? Maybe it’s just not for me.’ I guess I was probably just being a teenager.As I got older I could feel this growing narrative willing me to get engulfed in some big scandal off-screen. It felt like people were waiting for me to go off the rails, but it was never going to happen. We filmed the whole thing in this very intense bubble in Watford not Hollywood, so we didn’t have the chance to discover drugs, or anything like that.I’m naturally an introvert, but there is something about standing out – being in the limelight – that I enjoy, a little bit.Finishing Harry Potter was surreal. It was a very strange feeling but it came at the right time as we were all ready to move on but after the final shot it was quite weird to think that was it. It was disarming and at that point I didn’t really know what was happening. I felt a bit lost.The line between Ron and me became thinner with each film and I think we became virtually the same person. There’s a lot of me in Ron and moving on was a massive adjustment because it was such a constant part of my life. I don’t want to liken it to coming out of prison because it wasn’t a prison, but it did feel like stepping out of an institution. It was nice to breathe the fresh air and now I’m really enjoying stepping further away from that blue-screen world.I peaked pretty early, but I’m fine with that. It would be ridiculous to think that you can replicate that level of success. It’s always going to be a challenge, but I’m kind of enjoying that. It’s quite fun to surprise people.Turning 30 felt strange. It just doesn’t feel like I’m there yet and I don’t know what the future holds. I’m just going to go with the flow, keep playing interesting characters and see what happens. I’d like to settle down and have kids soon. If I had a son, would I call him Ron? It’s quite a good name, but probably not. And Grint’s a tough name to pair a one-syllable first name with.Snatch airs on Tuesdays at 9pm on AMC and on BT TV and ABC Murders will be on BBC1 at Christmas"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2c4cb5522a612ded52225598d90bac72c3a02cb/0_252_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2a212a4db9449c1012cf36a6bb3e0ac","title":"liam charles recipe for eggnog creme brulee cheesecake","story":"A creamy, boozy cheesecake with festive spice and a crackly, caramelised topThe caramelised top is best done with a blowtorch, but you can finish it under a grill.

City do function better, however, when David Silva is involved and, though the Spain midfielder came on for only the last 13 minutes, it was enough to make the point.“We were flat at times but that’s normal when you play a lot of matches,” Pep Guardiola said. “I’m still delighted with the win, because one or two big teams will drop points this weekend. Maybe we weren’t good for the whole 90 minutes but we did enough in 75 to win the game. I don’t know what Leroy Sané ate before the game but I am going to show him the video and try to get him to eat it again. Next time he complains about not playing, I’ll tell him if he plays like that he will be in the side.”Guardiola rested several key players following City’s midweek exertions against Lyon, though the home side retained enough pace to trouble Bournemouth in the form of Sané and Raheem Sterling on the flanks. The former was particularly effective in the first half, regularly running on to well-struck passes from Ilkay Gündogan or Oleksandr Zinchenko to find space in behind Bournemouth’s flattish back five.The first goal arrived in just such a manner, Zinchenko aiming a ball into the penalty area for Sané to attempt to reach first. The winger managed to stay onside and sprint clear of the Bournemouth defenders and, though Asmir Begovic left his line to try to cut out the danger, he was unable to make a clean catch because Sané was in such close attendance. Begovic succeeded in clearing the immediate threat from Sané but only at the expense of pushing the ball to Bernardo Silva, who unhesitatingly swept the ball into the unguarded net from close to the penalty spot.Ederson, in the City goal, is currently rivalling David de Gea at Old Trafford for minutes spent merely watching games without being directly involved, but like his counterpart at Manchester United he keeps up his concentration so as to be ready when called on. Bournemouth might have equalised a few minutes before Callum Wilson brought them level when the same player got on the end of a Josh King cross, though his touch was hardly emphatic and the hitherto unemployed Ederson made a sprawling save. Wilson made amends for the miss a minute before the interval, this time getting above Nicolás Otamendi and Danilo to meet Simon Francis’s cross and give Ederson little chance with a firm and well placed header.Turning round level was no more than Bournemouth deserved. City had enjoyed more than two thirds of the first-half possession but without David Silva seemed short of ideas of how to use it. Gabriel Jesus was inconspicuous as an attacking spearhead, and too many of the home side’s attempted attacks broke down on the edge of the area. Bournemouth gradually clawed their way back into the game as if surprised at how lightly they were being allowed to get off.As Ryan Fraser and Andrew Surman started to pass the ball around City’s 18-yard line, gaps appeared and, as the interval approached, Bournemouth were attacking with the sort of conviction that eventually brought a reward.Eddie Howe’s team began the second half brightly too, with Wilson straight away getting ahead of Aymeric Laporte to set up a chance for King. City went down the field to hit the post at the other end, Sterling ending an adventurous dribble with a slightly tame shot that deflected off Steve Cook to strike an upright. Undeterred, Sterling started and finished City’s second goal just before the hour, first setting up Danilo for a shot, then moving up to tuck away the rebound when the winger’s effort was blocked by a combination of Begovic and Nathan Aké.Even when back in the lead City showed signs of easing up again, so Guardiola sent on David Silva just to be on the safe side. It was a shrewd move. The substitute had been on the field precisely two minutes when he came up with the pass of the match, freeing Sané to cross from the goalline and leave Gündogan an easy close-range finish. “City have iniduals who can hurt you but I thought the goals were scrappy from our perspective,” Howe said. “I think that’s the closest we’ve come to matching them. At least we managed to limit them in terms of clear-cut chances.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/113d16416f27a047838eb2abec1a32b0df085bec/139_0_3209_1925/master/3209.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c162b9090384bce678670c786a2ae0bb","title":"sol campbell macclesfield bame managers","story":"Moss Rose was once described as the kind of place from where only a misanthropist would want to send a “Wish you were here” postcard. Which isn’t the kindest description when there will be supporters of Macclesfield Town who are very fond of this unpretentious little ground. But understandable, all the same, when you take into account the strangely lopsided stands, the matchstick floodlights, the confusing lack of symmetry and the fact the roof at one end is so low down the third‑floor residents of Mulberry Court, the block of flats next door, can see on to the pitch.A more generous description, perhaps, is that there is a lot more charm to be found at these kinds of lower-league grounds than some of the identikit bowls in out-of-town industrial estates higher up the football ladder. There is something rather endearing about the fact the pitch at Macclesfield has perimeter advertising boards for Mandarin House, a local Chinese takeaway, and the walls are lined with pictures of the team that beat Northwich Victoria to win the 1996 FA Trophy. The toast at the Silkmen Cafe is, as the menu promises, hot and buttery. The ale is served in Butch’s Bar and though the club shop – no megastore here – had a sign saying it was open, the lights were off and the door was locked when I arrived for Sol Campbell’s introductory press conference.Campbell pulled up a seat on the faded carpets of the McIlroy Suite. The hills on the horizon were a reminder of the beauty and wealth that exists in parts of Cheshire (never forget that Muttley McLad, lead singer of the Macc Lads, was actually called Tristan) and it was an unexpected bonus, behind one stand, to come across a workman in fluorescent orange scratching off the last remnants of a faded, barely distinguishable Manchester City sticker – the last reminder, possibly, from when the two sides played here in September 1998, amazing as it sounds now, on an equal footing in what is now League One. “City will have left the engine running on the team coach,” as one match report snootily put it.Twenty years on, the two clubs are poles apart in every sense and, if Macclesfield are to pull off a feat of escapology from the bottom rung of League Two, their new manager will have backed up all his talk. Campbell, after all, has been telling us for quite some time that he will make a brilliant manager and that it is madness the rest of the football world cannot necessarily see it.If he can save the Football League’s wooden-spoon club, his rhetoric won’t open himself to quite so much ridicule (Exhibit A: referring to himself as “one of the greatest minds in football”). At least he will be able to supply the hard evidence that he was right – and that the industry should have given him his opportunity long before now.He is certainly an interesting character, Sol. Not everyone is entirely convinced, it is fair to say, and if we are being totally candid his braggadocio and occasional lack of humility makes it no surprise, football being the industry of schadenfreude, that the people wishing him well (this correspondent included) must be aware there are quite a few others who are rubbernecking in Macclesfield’s direction to see if he falls flat on his face.Nor does he help himself sometimes, bearing in mind that jarring moment at Thursday’s press conference when it became apparent that, no, we hadn’t misheard him and, two minutes in, he was indeed congratulating Macclesfield for hiring a manager he described as previously being one of the greatest footballers in the world, as if it were perfectly normal to refer to himself that way. Or he wasn’t aware, perhaps, that putting your international caps on the table didn’t stop, say, Bobby Moore or Bobby Charlton – players from another level of greatness – from making lousy managers.That lack of self-awareness doesn’t tend to go down well in the dressing rooms of League Two and is certainly an issue if my impression of Campbell is correct: that he doesn’t necessarily realise how he comes across sometimes, that he is not the easiest man to read, or embrace, and that he might not have the skills set, judging from some of the stuff he comes out with, to leave any real sense that he is a natural team builder.When Campbell has argued in the past that he has been held back from management because of the colour of his skin he might have a very credible point when there is so much evidence of how much harder it is for someone with BAME background to be offered work. Yet there are others who will argue it is too simplistic in his case to believe the only reason he has been kept waiting is because he is black. And maybe there is something in that, too, when the industry is so gossipy and there are so many stories about his less attractive traits – arrogance, pomposity, self-entitlement, call it what you will – that might not sit well with potential employers.The latest example comes from Peter Crouch’s new book and is about their time together at Portsmouth and Campbell’s apparent habit of having two-hour massages until two minutes before every game. Portsmouth had two masseurs and Campbell would commandeer them both, one for each leg. Sometimes, the other players would complain. “He’d raise his head briefly,” Crouch writes, “and look expressionless. ‘When you’ve got 70 caps for England, come back and talk to me again.’”Troy Townsend, of Kick It Out, wrote a supportive article for the Times on Friday to commend Campbell for his perseverance and strength of character. Even then, however, Townsend could not brush over the fact that one of the challenges for Campbell included “people in football thinking you’re just a bit odd”.The time for example – and no apologies for repeating this one – when the then sports minister, Helen Grant, arranged a summit at Whitehall to discuss the lack of black managers and Campbell demanded an explanation from Dan Ashworth, the FA’s technical director, about why Gary Neville had been fast-tracked through the system. Fair enough, but when Ashworth spoke favourably about Neville’s work in the England setup the reply was a comedic: “But I am Sol Campbell.” Ashworth tried to continue and, again, a hand went up. “But I am Sol Campbell,” louder this time, more indignant. There are even anti-racism campaigners who can hear those five words and laugh at the tumbleweed floating across the room that day. And word gets around. Being perceived as odd might not stop someone from being a good football manager. It might, however, count against you in the selection process, especially when football clubs can attract 200-plus applicants for managerial vacancies.Ultimately, though, I hope Campbell makes a decent fist of it, bearing in mind we are coming up for 2019 and, rather pathetically, I find myself encouraged by the fact there are now eight BAME managers in the game. Eighteen months ago the figure was two – so small steps, and all that. But how absurd is it that eight out of 92 can feel like a minor breakthrough?The sport can hardly congratulate itself when there is still so much incontrovertible evidence – ignore the data and just use your eyes – that black managers do not get the same chances as white managers. Campbell has been kept waiting until the age of 44 (though, interestingly, he says he has applied for only 10-to-15 jobs over a seven‑year period) and, for a man widely accused of having a superiority complex, at least he has not turned up his nose about the idea of starting at the bottom.Since 1990 he is only the sixth black man to play for England and then go into management and if it doesn’t work out for him at Macclesfield the harsh reality is that he should not expect another chance. According to the League Managers Association, almost two thirds of all the black managers who have passed through the Football League never get a second job.There was always something faintly ludicrous about the way, half a dozen games into the new season, Phil Neville declared on Match of the Day 2 that Wolverhampton Wanderers were the best team to be promoted since the Premier League era began over a quarter of a century ago.A little research – a quick search of Wikipedia, nothing too onerous – might have informed Neville that Kevin Kevin’s Newcastle United finished third in 1993-94 and the Nottingham Forest side managed by Frank Clark did likewise the following year, both of them finishing above, among others, Arsenal and Liverpool.Two months on, it looks even sillier now Wolves have fallen into the bottom half of the table, with five defeats from their last six games, three successive losses at Molineux and not a single away fixture this season when they have managed more than one goal.The best promoted team of the Premier League era? It is not their fault a trigger-happy television pundit wanted to fluff them up so out of proportion, but there might be a case that some of the players have been seduced by the publicity. In one interview on Friday, before the 2-1 defeat at Cardiff, Matt Doherty said that Wolves had ambitions to win the Premier League within five to six years. Maybe so, but there is a PR rule that the top clubs tend to go by and it is very sensible: achieve first, then do your talking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5943d8c1bbf86677da01f01bf8cce9d7fea47d0d/0_140_2182_1309/master/2182.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24732c8b91d78856c73ba34d2114ad5c","title":"southampton manchester united premier league match report","story":"Manchester United battled back from two goals down to salvage a draw at lowly Southampton. Having climbed back into the game the visitors plateaued. They had reached their level and never looked like overcoming their hosts, who have still not won at home this season but produced a display to relieve some of the pressure on their manager, Mark Hughes. José Mourinho, whose team fell further towards mid-table, can expect no respite.The paradox in the previews for this match was that both managers complained they were being singled out for criticism. But both also knew that only their teams could put forward really compelling evidence in their defence, and time to do so was running low. Hughes’ side responded on cue. Mourinho’s stammered before finding their voice.In an effort to stimulate improvement, both managers had got radical with their lineups. Hughes altered formation and gave first Premier League starts to a pair of teenagers: 19-year-old defender Yan Valery and 18-year-old striker Michael Obafemi. Scoring was a persistent problem for Southampton even before Hughes’s arrival in March and with neither Manolo Gabbiadini nor Charlie Austin finding the net in the Premier League so far this season, Hughes perhaps felt he had little to lose in turning to Obafemi in the absence of the injured Danny Ings.Mourinho, meanwhile, opted against giving a Premier League debut to a teenager, leaving Diogo Dalot on the bench and deploying Ashley Young as a right wing-back instead. But the real intrigue in his selection was elsewhere: with only one fully fit centre-back available he nonetheless set his team up with a three-man backline, with Scott McTominay and Nemanja Matic flanking Phil Jones. Marouane Fellaini was assigned patrol duties just in front of that trio, while Ander Herrera and Paul Pogba were intended as the central conduits to a front pair of Romelu Lukaku and Marcus Rashford.With Juan Mata, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard relegated to the bench, it looked like Mourinho had sent out a team whose priority was to contain a side that had won only once at this venue in 2018. The fact that Mourinho was deprived of defenders and had a surplus of attackers at his disposal made his approach all the more peculiar.United’s forward duo did nearly combine to open the scoring in the second minute but not because of any creativity in midfield. Instead the chance came from a blunder by Alex McCarthy, who missed the ball entirely as he attempted to clear. Rashford cleverly kept it in play with a backheel but Lukaku could not convert, McCarthy recovering to block his shot.If Lukaku’s attempted finish betrayed the lack of conviction of a striker who had not scored in his 12 previous matches, Stuart Armstrong soon produced a shot fuelled by the confidence of having netted twice last week at Fulham. Southampton’s opening goal in the 13th minute was beautifully worked, too. Nathan Redmond went on a skilful dribble before feeding Obafemi at the edge of the area. The 18-year-old picked out Armstrong in space on the right hand side of the box and the Scot crowned the buildup with an immaculate finish, driving low into the far corner.United got worse before they got better. In the 19th minute Rashford conceded a free-kick just outside his own area. Cédric Soares, deployed in an unfamiliar left-back role, produced a finish more commonly associated with his compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo, curling over the wall and beyond the reach of David De Gea.Southampton were looking vibrant, but their woes are too deeply ingrained to be forgotten. When United, inspired by Rashford, woke up, Southampton became dishevelled. After shrugging off a tackle by Maya Yoshida, Rashford slipped in Lukaku, who showed no hesitation this time, blasting a shot into the net from 12 yards. Six minutes later Rashford created the equaliser, dashing into the box before pulling a low cross back to the near post, where Herrera finished with an artful flick.Fellaini went close with a header from a cross by Young in the 51st minute. But much of the play was scruffy, neither team finding fluency and both guilty of misplaced passes and misjudged tackles. It was low-grade fare.Rashford flickered for United, and Obafemi was an exception for the hosts, showing precocious composure and deft touches before being replaced by Gabbiadini after the hour. The youngster could have been awarded a penalty just before that but the referee deemed an ungainly tackle by McTominay to have been fair. Hughes, unsurprisingly, expressed a contrary view from the sideline. Dalot made his introduction in the 72nd minute in place of Shaw, who had to limp off.Despite ending his drought, Lukaku generally lumbered to little effect up front, partly because of inadequate service. Neither team threatened a winner, although Redmond forced De Gea to bat a long-range shot over the bar in the 80th minute."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa2afbd54e1dee22677ecaeb58c715bcf9c68346/0_91_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9c620c54a59f66bcae0140e873e2b7d","title":"southampton v manchester united premier league live","story":"Saints started fast, but United came back at them, as these two clubs served up another thriller on the south coast.Mad Dogs. There’s the agenda for the next few days set, then. Gotta love Jose, he’s always worth the price of the ticket. All that’s left is to point you in the direction of Paul Doyle’s match report, and to wish you luck getting rid of the following earworm. Thanks for reading. Nighty night!And now Jose! “We lost so many balls in midfield, in our transitions to the last third, it was difficult to have that continuity. The reason we did so well in the last 20 minutes of the first half was we connected with our attacking players by transporting the ball well, leaving it at the right moment, the right choice of pass, play it simple. In the second half we went back to the dynamic where we lose too many balls in the midfield, and when the players don’t understand that simplicity is genius, and they keep and keep and keep playing complicated football, it is difficult. But we had good spirit to come back to 2-2, good fight, a great example of players fighting to their limit. Positive examples are Marcus Rashford and Phil Jones, many others showing respect for the shirt. That respect for the club. The first goal was because we don’t press enough. It is something we do wrong, doesn’t matter the system we play, it is down to the characteristics of the players. We don’t have many mad dogs, the ones that bite the ball all the time, the ones who press all the time. We don’t have many with that spirit.”Mark Hughes speaks! “We have to view it as a positive. We’ve been playing well for a number of weeks. But when you don’t get the results people expect or demand, then sometimes you don’t get the credit for the level of performance. But I thought we did really well. Clearly there was a couple of moments defensively when we had chances to clear our lines, and we didn’t do that as well as I would have liked. And as a consequence, we let them get back into the game. But in the second half, we were better in that regard and restricted United to very few efforts in goal. I can’t recall a time when we were really under the cosh. Not a lot of momentum generated by United. That’s credit to us. In terms of efforts on goal, we edged that, so overall I’m really pleased. It’s a positive point. We will build on that. This gives us confidence. Ideally we would have preferred three points, but we can’t complain.”Southampton’s man of the match, Nathan Redmond, speaks to BT Sport, and begins with a sigh. “Yeah, two up! We had a foothold in the game. We’ve been working hard on a few different formations in the last few weeks, and we stuck with this one from the midweek. It paid off in the first half, but we’re kicking ourselves a little bit for not managing the game better. We’ll have to learn to pick up more points. We started on the front foot, we have to build on some of the good things, and learn from the bad. We wanted to impose ourselves and fight. We did that.”That point serves Saints a little better than United. They’re still in the bottom three, but leapfrog Burnley, who appear to be in all sorts of trouble. They’re a point behind Huddersfield in 17th. United meanwhile stay in seventh, now level on 22 points with Everton. They’ll go sixith tomorrow should Liverpool win the Merseyside derby by six goals, but presumably they’ll not want that to happen.Nope. Young’s free kick is easily cleared, and the referee blows his whistle. That game was a lot of fun. A draw seems a fair result. Hughes seems the happier, blowing out his cheeks with relief, while Jose stomps off down the tunnel.90 min +5: United go up the other end, Young buying a cheap foul from a panicked Armstrong. The Saints midfielder is booked. Can United score yet another late winner?90 min +4: Gabbiadini dribbles down the inside-right channel. He cuts across Young, in hot pursuit. Young clatters him to the turf, and that’s his fifth booking of the season. Suspension ahoy! And a free kick, 25 yards out. Saints line up on the edge of the United box ... and so Gabbiadini decides to go for goal and blooters a preposterous effort miles over the bar. What a waste! On the touchline, Mark Hughes is incandescent.90 min +3: Fellaini takes receipt of the throw, and clanks it straight back out of play. In the United dugout, Mourinho throws his hands around in the expressive style, while talking quite a lot and frowning.90 min +2: It’s United pressing for the winner. They pen Saints back into their final third, and earn a throw down the left. Before it can be taken, Lemina is replaced by Davis.90 min +1: In the first of four added minutes, Young lifts a very poor free kick high into the box, allowing McCarthy to claim with ease.90 min: Martial dribbles down the left. Down a dead end. But Hojbjerg foolishly barges into his back, turning a lost cause into a very dangerous free kick. United load the box!89 min: Ah there we go. United have pushed Fellaini forward!88 min: United stroke it around the middle of the park, showing very little desire to go forward. But then they prefer to score their winners in the 90th minute these days, having done so against Bournemouth, Juventus and Young Boys in recent weeks. Maybe they’re just biding their time. Is another Jose Time stunner on the cards?84 min: Lukaku stands on the ball and falls over. For some reason, the referee decides to stop the game, with Saints in possession. On the touchline, several litres of hot steam pour from Mark Hughes’ lugs.83 min: Redmond skitters down the right. He overruns the ball, but it breaks to Hojbjerg, who rolls it to the left for Gabbiadini. The Italian’s snapshot is blocked the second it leaves his boot.81 min: From the resulting corner, Hojbjerg flashes a header wide right.80 min: Pogba makes a balls of a drag-back in the centre of the field, allowing Redmond to advance on the United area. He shoots from distance, and there’s enough swerve on the rising shot to force a backtracking de Gea into tipping over the bar.79 min: A couple of folk in the United end didn’t seem particularly happy with the withdrawal of Rashford, making their feelings known by shouting while frowning. But word is the striker has a problem with his ankle.77 min: Rashford is replaced by Martial. 76 min: Hojbjerg tries to fire a shot past de Gea from the best part of 40 yards. Full marks for ambition.75 min: And now another decent dribble by Redmond, who George Bests his way across the face of the area, right to left, but can only shank his eventual shot well wide right.73 min: Redmond makes two fine runs down the right within 60 seconds or so. He’s in a lot of space both times. He crosses for Armstrong, then Gabbiadini, but neither cross finds his man.72 min: Mourinho prepares to replace Shaw with Dalot. Then it appears Shaw wishes to continue. After a moment of uncertainty, Jose presses the button and makes the substitution. Shaw’s on the wrong side of the pitch, and as he begins to make his way round to the dugout, the home fans give their former player a warm ovation. He returns the favour.70 min: Lukaku, out on the right, tries to find Rashford in the Saints box. His cross is wildly overhit. Meanwhile Shaw is down, holding a leg. It looks like he might not be able to continue.68 min: Gabbiadini twists and turns down the inside left, and works enough space to send a no-backlift toe-punt straight at de Gea. Up the other end, Pogba tries an overhead kick from the edge of the box. That one’s straight at the keeper as well.67 min: McTominay, from a deep position on the right, batters a very strange ball upfield and out of play for a goal kick on the left. Goodness knows what he was trying there.65 min: Pogba bursts away from Lemina in the midfield and very nearly slips Lukaku free down the middle. Not quite, and Saints are able to batter the ball clear.63 min: But Obafemi looks to have tweaked his hamstring making that run. There’s still enough time for him to claim a penalty, as McTominay (legally) pokes the ball away from him as the pair fall in the United box. And then he’s replaced by Gabbiadini. He’s afforded a warm round of applause as he limps off.62 min: Stephens slips over, and very nearly allows Rashford to scamper clear. The defender does very well to drape himself over the ball, then get up and clear. He then sends Obafemi away on a magical dribble towards the United area. He slips the ball wide to Redmond, who can’t find anyone in the centre. A fine run by the young man.60 min: Yoshida heads Young’s free kick behind for a corner on the right. Rashford takes. It’s half cleared. The ball flies to the former Saint, Shaw, who channels his inner Le Tissier and flicks the ball up with his left, then sends a screamer goalwards with his right. It’s a bit overambitious, though, and sails harmlessly wide.59 min: McTominay knocks the ball past Vestergaard on the outside, and rounds him on the other. The defender hangs out a cynical leg, and that’s a booking too. A free kick out on the right. Young’s over it again.58 min: Obafemi is going away from goal. Pogba pulls him back. He’s playing with fire having been booked. The referee issues a harsh word or two. Redmond takes the resulting free kick, right of centre, 25 yards out. It’s straight at de Gea.56 min: Redmond is the only Saints player showing anything in attack right now. He’s made a couple of dribbles down the left since the restart this one sees him one-two with Hojbjerg, only to fire his cross behind Obafemi and Armstrong in the middle.54 min: Lemina repays Pogba by kicking the back of his leg, and pulls his shirt for good measure. That’s a booking, his fifth of the season. He’ll be serving a suspension soon as a result.53 min: Lemina is in the process of swanning past Pogba when the World Cup winner clips him to the floor. That’s a booking.52 min: Fellaini gets a jump on the entire Southampton rearguard. But he clanks his header wide right from close range. That was a real chance for the big man. An accordingly pained look spreads across his grid.51 min: Vestergaard clatters into Rashford out on the United right. A free kick, and an opportunity for United to pile everyone forward. Young is over it.50 min: United hog the ball. They go nowhere in particular with it, but they’re establishing a level of control that was completely lacking for most of that first half.48 min: ... McCarthy comes off his line and flaps. But he’s been put under excessive pressure by McTominay, and the referee blows up for a foul. McTominay’s header clears the bar anyway.47 min: Fellaini wins the ball cheaply in the midfield, Saints not yet out of the dressing room. He lays off to Pogba, who considers a shot but shuttles the ball wide left to Shaw. The full back wins a corner. From which, another corner. From which ...Here we go again, then. United get the ball rolling once more. No half-time changes. Good luck predicting the final score on the evidence of that first half. Half-time reading. If you’re in the market for some more Premier League match reports, you’ve come to the right place. (Those desirous of the Palace-Burnley and City-Bournemouth reports need only scroll back to the start.)Well, those 47 minutes fair whistled by! Southampton were magnificent for half an hour United dreadful. Then the last 15 minutes were all United. A half of three thirds. Please don’t go away anything could happen in the second half.45 min +1: Herrera launches one goalwards from 20 yards. It’s straight down McCarthy’s throat.

But when it comes to lessons in life, music has most of the answersWhen my marriage dissolved a decade ago, I went to a cognitive therapist to see if I could make sense of it. I sat in a small room with a kindly old lady who was not my mother, but who may as well have been, as we discussed love and sex as best we could. Although delivering my opinion about what had happened out loud without shouting was an enjoyable relief, I can’t say I truly learned much. We decided I wasn’t such a bad person. We decided my ex-wife wasn’t a bad person either. Then I paid my £60 and arranged to return the following week.Eventually, I stopped making those arrangements to return. What was I learning there, in those meetings, that I hadn’t heard a thousand times already listening to Pain in My Heart by Otis Redding, Love Will Tear Us Apart by Joy Division, or You Can Leave, But it’s Going to Cost You by Marvin Gaye? I hadn’t spent my entire teens in my bedroom with the door closed playing records, to not have those hard-won insights to fall back upon in times of romantic trouble. Therapy helps lift the weight from your chest, which is useful in times of crisis. But music can illuminate the way forward.Midway through my second month of living in my friend’s spare room in Shepherd’s Bush, I was given Kingdom of Rust by Doves to review. In my heightened state of emotional emergency, I quickly imagined that it was a concept album about the end of a long-term relationship. “My God, it takes an ocean of trust in the kingdom of rust,” ran the chorus of the title track. It was as if it had been written for me. Soon after, I interviewed Doves’ chief songwriter Jimi Goodwin and straightaway told him my theory about his new songs. He was taken aback. I explained my circumstances. “Ah, sorry to hear that,” he replied, “but we’ve all been there. The songs can share the burden.” For the next few weeks, Kingdom of Rust accompanied me everywhere, pointing my gaze towards the horizon in a way that cognitive therapy never quite managed. Cheaper, too.Noel Gallagher famously sang that listeners of Oasis should not put their life in the hands of a rock’n’roll band. I fundamentally disagree. Everything good in my life has been recommended to me by my musical heroes. My moral compass has been set almost entirely by pop stars. No teacher, no institution, no writer (OK, maybe some writers, actually) has had the same impact upon me as rock stars. Who forged your direction in life? Your parents? School? Your peers? Maybe it was a religious calling, or even a political party. If so, it’s not too late to rethink your choice and invest in musicians instead. I drew everything I believe in, initially, from Paul Weller, lead singer with the Jam. He changed my life, forever. The London I grew up in the late 1970s was grim: the rubbish piled up, the National Front daubed their initials upon school walls, Thatcher snatched our milk. But Weller rocked up with visions of social utopia attached to the kind of chorus that any idiot 11-year-old could remember. His clothes were fantastic. He was pictured reading Alan Sillitoe and George Orwell. He proclaimed that his fans should investigate an array of soul, reggae, funk and 60s beat records.He signed off his fan letters with the advice that we should “stay cool, clean and hard”. I soaked it all up and his maxims became the foundations upon which the rest of my life was built. I still dress a bit like he did in 1983.Other great teachers followed. Kevin Rowland of Dexys Midnight Runners made me seriously consider Irish politics and woolly hats in a way I may not have otherwise. Mark E Smith of the Fall opened my eyes to the power of lateral thinking and the supernatural. Chuck D of Public Enemy highlighted how the lives of Afro-Americans had not, in fact, dramatically improved since the civil rights movements. Siouxsie Sioux lifted up the manicured carpets of suburban homes to show us what scurried beneath. And on and on and on…All had their own distinct philosophies, experiences and influences, and all were available to download directly into the brain via their music and, especially, their interviews, which I devoured. As a pre-teen, I signed up to music as a way of life with such religious fervour that I determined my love of it, and belief in the teachings of my heroes, would see me through all my life choices. More than that, it would guide them.I left school at 17 because I believed, without any tangible qualification beyond an O-level in French, that I would one day earn my living writing and that the last place I was going to further that ambition was at school. This clearly idiotic belief was iron-clad, though, and indebted to my bookish, single-minded musical dropout heroes: Mark E Smith, Lawrence from Felt, etc.In the meantime, I needed to pay the rent, but also to be immersed in music. When I finally managed to secure it, I viewed my full-time job at Our Price Records as the equivalent of entry to one of the best universities. There I was able to spend eight hours a day surrounded by thousands of records I’d never heard, and also order in anything newly released I’d read about in the press. I met like-minds, too, as my colleagues were often similarly adrift in music. We knew the job was finite, but that our loyalty to music and musicians was forever. We were hopeless lifers.Eventually I had to graduate from Our Price, but where to? With no natural – or unnatural – musical ability of my own, the only place I could really contribute was by documenting the work of musicians: those who can record and tour, those who can’t become music journalists. And so now, as editor of music magazine Q, I am drawn to methods that can deliver the lessons that have been learned by rock stars. A few months ago we started to talk about a book that collated all of the wisdom we’d collected from pop stars down the years. Editing The Ten Commandments: The Rock Star’s Guide to Life was like an intense course in self-help, taught by Iggy Pop, Stevie Nicks, Ice-T and 47 other pop stars.Yes, there are lots of examples of musicians acting selfishly and stupidly. They can be pompous, greedy, vain hypocrites. But their insights have never let me down in the way that all institutions at some point have, in the way that I have let myself down.School failed me, marriage failed me – or rather, I failed them – and no job is for life. I am a strong advocate of therapy in moments of crises, but have found it frustratingly opaque as a navigational tool when not negotiating emotional emergency: tell me what to do! The wisdom in song, though, the insights of musicians… that light never goes out. As mind-expanding as books, film and art can be, as tightly as you can hold those to you, they have not shaped my tastes, my politics, my worldview, my wardrobe as consistently as watching the Specials on Top of The Pops in 1979. I remain lost in music, and glad to be in that trap.The Ten Commandments: the Rock Star’s Guide to Life edited by Ted Kessler is published by Corsair, £9.99.

The artist formerly known as Scary Spice was enjoying success as a judge on The X Factor, the public adored her once again, and most important of all, she was ecstatically in love with her husband, Stephen Belafonte. Not only were they soulmates, she told me, they shared an extraordinary intimacy after seven years of marriage, they had sex five times a day. They were so compatible, she said, that she had basically married herself. She showed me the wedding-vow-renewal ring he had just bought her, and told me she was the luckiest woman in the world.Only it turns out she was lying.In her new memoir, Brutally Honest, Brown reveals that her marriage could not have been more unhappy. She claims Belafonte was abusive, and that she could only get through the day by snorting cocaine for breakfast. Had she not finally gathered the courage to leave, she believes she may well have ended up dead. Brown says she didn’t know the word back then, but she thinks she was a classic victim of gaslighting – made to feel so small, stupid and inadequate that she doubted her own sanity.Two weeks after that 2014 interview was published in Weekend, Brown attempted suicide. Somehow she managed to drag herself out of hospital to appear as a judge on the final of The X Factor. Viewers were shocked by her appearance: her cheek was bruised, and there were scratches on her arms. She was not wearing her wedding ring. Belafonte took to Twitter to defend himself: “I don’t usually respond to Twitter msgs but I will respond to comments of hitting my wife which I think are quite disgusting un true!” Meanwhile, Brown said she had a stomach ulcer.It’s an astonishing story – not least because this is Scary Spice we’re talking about, the girl in the leopardskin with a tongue stud, the very personification of girl power. What happened?Today, we meet in a photo studio in London. I can hear her laughter – throaty, raucous – before I see her. Brown, now 43, tends to dominate a room. She is in a white dressing robe, getting made up and giving her team the lowdown on Peter Andre, a former boyfriend. “He was my booty call – a fantastic lover. And he was so polite. He’d ask before he kissed me!” She has lived in Los Angeles for years now, but her accent is unchanged – vowels hard and flat as slabs of concrete. And she still likes to talk about sex – her voracious appetite, her many lovers, her attraction to men and women. Nothing’s changed on that front but as she will tell me, there is a distinction between all this and being pressured into activities she was unhappy with, or having them filmed without her knowledge by her former husband.I ask if she remembers showing me that ring four years ago. “Yes. I should have said, ‘Look what I bought myself.’ Yeah. Crazy.” Why did she lie about the ring being a gift? “You condition yourself. It was just lie after lie after lie, and I got used to lying. I didn’t want anyone to find out what was going on.” Of course she told people she loved her husband, she says – what else would she say? “It was just a spiel. And inside I’d be thinking, ‘You’ve no idea how evil this person is I’m going to have to go home to in a few hours. Can I please stay at work a little bit longer – or is there a park I can go to with my kids?’”Brown’s friends and family had warned her against Belafonte, an American film producer who already had previous. In 2003, he pleaded no contest to a charge of battery against his former partner, estate agent Nicole Contreras. He also has convictions for theft and vandalism, and admitted to beating a duck to death with a brick.When they met, she says, she was in a vulnerable place, having recently separated from the actor Eddie Murphy. After Brown became pregnant a few months into their relationship, Murphy had told a journalist: “I don’t know whose child that is until it comes out and has a blood test.” Brown was portrayed in the press as a ruthless gold-digger – ironic considering she was worth a fortune at the time. A DNA test proved that Murphy was the father, and he now sees 11-year-old Angel regularly but the relationship was over.For how long was he like this? “A few weeks… months?” She smiles, realising how pitiable that sounds. “But it’s done in a very passive-aggressive way, so you don’t really know what’s going on and you start to blame yourself. ‘Maybe I can do better as a wife. I need to be more attentive, I need to make him happier.’ I didn’t want another failed marriage. So I stay in it, and it just snowballs.”Does she think he loved her? “No. No. No.” She weighs up each no, becoming more emphatic. “What he did, you can’t do that to someone if you love them. No, he didn’t love me.”It’s hard to reconcile this with the fearless Mel B we thought we knew – the kid who was regularly grounded by her father for failing to do her schoolwork or wearing short skirts the 16-year-old who left home to dance in Blackpool clubs the 18-year-old who answered an advert in the Stage for a “streetwise, outgoing, ambitious, dedicated” girl to audition for an all-female pop act the 21-year-old who became a household name as in-your-face Scary. The Spice Girls were an instant phenomenon, still the bestselling female group of all time.While the swagger and insouciance have always been part of her character, Brown says that in other ways she is an old-fashioned girl who just wants to please. Her parents might have stood out, as a mixed-race couple in 1970s Leeds (her father was from St Kitts and Nevis, her mother is white and Yorkshire-born), but they were conservative. They wanted their daughter to get a decent education, hold down a good job, to marry and stay married.Brown felt she had let her parents down when she orced Jimmy Gulzar (her backing dancer in the Spice Girls and Phoenix’s father) in 2000, after only 16 months of marriage. After Angel’s birth, she felt she had let herself down again, a single mother of two children by two different men. In 2011, she had a third daughter, Madison, with Belafonte. The last thing she wanted, she says, was to embarrass her family by being the single mother of three daughters. So she hung on. And, of course, there was another factor: she felt terrified.Last year, she stated in her orce papers that she had been “subjected to multiple physical beatings”. One example cited occurred in 2012, when she was rehearsing for an appearance on Australia’s X Factor with R\u0026ampB star Usher. She alleged that Belafonte “flew into a rage, claiming I had been flirting with Usher all day” and “punched me in the face with a closed fist”. Every detail was fodder for the tabloids. Meanwhile, lawyers for Belafonte branded the allegations “outrageous and unfounded” and “nothing more than a smear campaign”. (She later withdrew allegations of physical abuse.)One of the things that attracted her to Belafonte, she says, was that he had a libido to rival hers. Early on in their marriage, they decided to experiment with threesomes. “I didn’t say, ‘Ooh, don’t be so disgusting.’ I thought, ‘No this is the man who loves me, we could try that once in a while, it’s fine.’” The only thing Brown insisted on was that the person was female, which suited Belafonte.But, she says, she quickly tired of the threesomes. “After the first few times I didn’t enjoy it, but he would want to do it more often. I’d be thinking, ‘We’ve only been married a few months – why do we need to do that?’ But then something abusive would happen which made me shut up about it.”Belafonte told her that he had filmed their sexual activities without her knowledge, as well as her taking drugs and he threatened to use the footage to destroy her. “I was being blackmailed with videos. He’d say, ‘I’m going to expose you, you’re never going to be able to work again. I’m going to send these videos out to the press, and everyone is going to see what a mess you are.’”She claims that the relationship quickly became coercive. For example, he would insist they went to the annual Playboy Mansion party in Beverly Hills, against her will despite appearances, she says, she is quite shy. At the mansion, he would expect her to find a woman they could take home.It sounds as if you were procuring women, I say. “What does procuring mean?” she asks. (Brown recently discovered she is dyslexic, and has started carrying a dictionary around with her.) Pimping, I say. “Of course I was. Some years, I would just stand my ground and say I’m not going, but there were massive fights. He would almost send me out and I’d bring back the girl.”Belafonte took control of the family finances, arguing that Brown was too busy to look after her money, and it was best if he did. “It comes across as, ‘Oh God he really loves me, he’s looking after me, I don’t have to worry about this.’ Then he’s planting the seeds to be able to have the credit card to my bank account. But it doesn’t happen overnight. It’s bit by bit, very strategically done.”By now, she had stopped seeing friends and family. Before long, she says, she had become cut off from nearly everybody she loved – even her daughters. The family moved home frequently, but always to multistorey houses she and Belafonte would live at the top, while the children were four floors below.Before long, she felt incapable of fighting back. But you always seemed so strong, I say. “No,” she says. “I’m only strong in certain ways. I’ve been painfully weak.” How? “There was a point when I was like, ‘Yeah, I am a really bad person. I am ugly, I am worth nothing. I am a has-been Spice Girl.’ All these negative things that would be drilled into me on a daily basis by him. You start to believe it.”I mention one horrific part of the book when she describes waking up lying in urine, faeces and blood. “And vomit,” she adds. What had happened? “Sometimes I would have been in such panic or shock that I’d have been physically sick. Part of that cycle is you get blamed: ‘Look what you’ve done to the sheets.’ And you go, ‘Oh my God, I’m so sorry.’ And you clean it up, or throw it away and that’s that.” She says it with a kind of no-nonsense finality.What happened the day she tried to kill herself? “I just wanted that pain to go,” Brown says. “I didn’t want to exist.” What had brought it on? “The whole 10 years. I don’t remember what happened that day. I’ve got PTSD – I’m very raw about what I felt.” But as soon as she swallowed the last pill in the bottle, she thought of her girls, screamed, and decided she had to live. She called a security guard, who got her help.Brown was always the main breadwinner, and thankfully she says Belafonte wanted to keep it that way. “That was when I felt in control – when I was on TV, or in photoshoots, or being interviewed. That’s what kept me somewhat sane.” She talks about the relief of being able to escape to Australia to film The X Factor for a few weeks. “But then you go, ‘Well, I’m married and I have to go back to that.’ And you don’t see a way out.”There was another factor in her decision to stay. In 2009, Brown’s father was diagnosed with cancer. Even though she was estranged from her family, she was desperate not to upset them further. She was convinced that, if she left Belafonte, he would publicise every detail of their relationship and that the shame would kill her father. She decided she had to wait for her father to die first.In 2017, she got a call telling her that her father did not have long left, and rushed from LA to Leeds. “When I walked into the hospital room, he hadn’t spoken in months. And he looked at me and whispered, ‘I love you.’ His whole body was shaking, then he went back into a coma.” On his death bed, she told him she was leaving Belafonte.At her lowest, whom could she talk to about her marriage? “Nobody. Because saying it out loud to anybody else I’d have to admit it. My two youngest didn’t see what was happening. But Phoenix would hear me crying, so she knew all wasn’t great in paradise.” In her book, Brown accuses Jimmy Gulzar of leeching off her and having anger issues, and says Eddie Murphy didn’t like her to leave his sight. Has she had any good relationships? She reels off the names of some of the men who have not abused her – Murphy included. “Max Beesley. Peter Andre. Eddie. They’re all lovely guys. I’ve had some really kind, loving relationships.” Wasn’t her relationship with Murphy still a cage, albeit a gilded one? “Well, yes and no. He’s very ‘family’, which I love. Eddie’s just a homebody.”Brown writes that her relationship with Murphy was romantic and loving, far from a casual fling. Has he ever acknowledged that? “Well, we’ll see when the book comes out!” It’s the first time in a while I’ve heard that laugh. Brown also reveals that she was the one who walked out, after a row over her independence (she wanted them to buy a house together, he wanted to buy it for her). She flew back to Leeds, refusing to answer his calls. That’s when he told a TV reporter he didn’t know if he was the father of their baby.Brown insists she had always planned to go back to him. But if it was just a bit of an argument, why on earth didn’t you answer his calls, I say? No wonder he assumed it was all over. She sounds shocked, as if she’s just considered it for the first time. “I guess that does make sense,” she says quietly. “I thought he knew I was coming back. I was always coming back. That was a given.”When Brown finally left Belafonte last year, she walked out of the house with just $936 (he controlled most of their accounts). How much did she have at her peak? “Gazillions. Millions and millions and millions.” She says it was liberating walking away with so little. “I took back my freedom. And I knew, from that day forward, that I’d know where my money is going.”In the orce papers, Belafonte’s lawyer claimed she had “wiped out all of her Spice Girls’ money, approximately $50m, if not more”. Brown’s legal team claimed that the videotapes, which the couple shared with lawyers, showed she was drugged by Belafonte, and then forced to perform “non-consensual” sex acts. Belafonte’s lawyers insisted they had footage proving she gave her consent. When they finally settled, she agreed to pay him an estimated £1.5m over three years and £3.5m from the sale of their house. She withdrew the allegations of physical abuse, while he agreed not to show the tapes. Brown was ordered to pay Belafonte $40,000 a month in spousal support.Two weeks ago, Brown was awarded joint custody of their seven-year-old daughter, Madison, after passing several weeks of drug and alcohol testing. Both Brown and Belafonte were ordered to stay 200 yards away from each other, and Brown was ordered to pay his $350,000 legal fees.Is she now Poor Spice? She laughs, and says no chance: she’s already on her way back. “Fortunately, in the last year and a half, I’ve actually earned a shitload of money. All the contracts he took charge of, I’m now managing myself.” As well as the lucrative Spice Girls reunion, there will reportedly be a return to America’s Got Talent.Brown is desperate for a cigarette break. We go outside, and she sparks up. She says how excited she is about the forthcoming Spice Girls tour. There will only be four of the band, though – Victoria Beckham declined. Is it true that she told Beckham to, “Fuck off, you bitch”, as has been reported, when she snubbed them? “Well, anybody who knows me knows that’s my lingo, whether it be in a jokey way or whether I’m frustrated or annoyed. I’m sure it was something along those lines, because I want all five of us to get back together. Four is better than nothing, so I’m super happy it’s happening. But if she wants to join us – fingers crossed, at some point she will.”What was Beckham’s response? “I don’t think there was one. Hahahahaha! We’re all on a group email, us five. There’s lots of love and lots of history between all five of us, and between me and Victoria. Yeah, I’m feisty, and she can be feisty, too.”She lights up another fag before the other is out. Which Spice Girl is she closest to? She mentions Geri, and then says they also argue a lot. In the book, she recounts nostalgically the days they used to drive down the motorway flashing their breasts at oncoming cars. There were rumours that you and Geri slept together, I say. “Do you mean have sex, or did we just sleep in a bed together?” Sex? “Let’s just say I slept in a bed with them all. Hahahahhahahaha! I don’t think I should answer that!” For once, discretion gets the better of her.“I’m going to chain-smoke,” she says, before sparking up again. “You know, the great thing about us five is that we’re the only five people in the world who can say, ‘I’m a Spice Girl.’ I love that. I’m part of my elite club.” It’s touching to hear her say that – not least because she spent so many years thinking that being a “has-been” Spice Girl was a mark of failure.On the way back in, we pass her leopardskin jacket, hooked round a bannister. “My old costumes still fit me. I said to the girls, ‘I’ve already got my wardrobe for the tour!’”What is she enjoying most about life now? “My freedom. And I mean that on every level.” It’s impossible to know exactly what goes on in a relationship, especially when the person providing the account admits she has been an unreliable narrator in the past – but it’s clear that Brown remains traumatised by her marriage. When she tells me what she has done to her body since leaving Belafonte, I realise how determined she is to obliterate him. When they were together, she got a tattoo down her side. “It said, ‘Stephen, till death do us part, you own my heart’.” Has she had it lasered? “No. I got it cut out. I was put under for it, and I said to the doctor, ‘Give me the ugliest scar ever because I want it to be a reminder that that ugly person is cut out of my life.’” I also read that she had vaginal rejuvenation surgery after leaving Belafonte. No, she says, that’s not quite right. “They scraped the inside of my vagina and put new tissue in. It’s almost like a rape victim would do – essentially, you want to scrub yourself clean.”I tell her I’m thinking about that 2014 interview, when she talked about how much she loved herself and said, well, if she didn’t, then who would? “I do believe that. Did I love myself then? I probably loathed myself. But I can genuinely say now: yes, I do love myself. And I did when I entered into my marriage and that got chipped away. I allowed that to be chipped away.”Having come through it all, she says she feels better than she has in decades. Every day she rejoices in her new freedoms – to play her music full blast, to e-bomb in her LA pool with the girls, to practise reiki, to keep a pet goat. “As soon as I walked into our new house, just little things make me cry on the inside – the girls can sit at a table and play. I’m so happy living a life where they can just be kids and be with their mum. I think I’m more confident than I’ve ever been. Ever ever ever. Because I had no confidence for so many years and I had to nurture myself, almost bring myself back to life.”What does she hope people get out of the book? She mentions the final page, headlined Fifteen Signs Of Abuse. “I want it to be helpful to other women who have gone through it, or who are going through it. There are so many women that this has happened to. It’s an epidemic. I’m not just talking about the #MeToo movement, I’m talking about everywhere – from a council estate in Leeds to what’s going on in parliament. You hear of other people and think, ‘Well, that’s just a doomed relationship – that’s never going to happen to me.’ You never think you’re going to be eating, breathing, living that life. And then you are and you’re in denial: there’s no way out.”But you did get out, I say. “Yeah, I know. Many women don’t make it out alive, and if they do they’re badly damaged. I’m one of the lucky ones.” • Brutally Honest by Melanie Brown with Louise Gannon is published by Quadrille Publishing at £17.99.

The BBC’s would include a panel of 20 prominent commentators that are equally split between supporting and opposing May’s Brexit deal, while Sky and ITV’s bid would be a more straightforward head to head.Labour has claimed the BBC format would be “messy and confusing”, and presents May with the opportunity to cast her opponents as ided since one side would be unanimous in its support for her plan.“Theresa May said she wanted a head-to-head debate with me on her botched Brexit deal and I am ready to do that,” tweeted the Labour leader. “ITV have a straightforward plan. If she and her team prefer BBC, she should join me in asking them to arrange an actual head-to-head debate.”His comments followed an increasingly bitter row over whether the BBC had discussed a May-Corbyn debate with Downing Street before Sunday, when the  reported that the prime minister had challenged the Labour leader.The state broadcaster then appeared to encourage Corbyn to accept their format in a tweet that said May had accepted their offer. “We’re delighted she’s agreed and hope to hear soon from the Labour party,” the BBC press team wrote on Thursday.The row was said to have highlighted the influence of May’s communications chief, Robbie Gibb, who until last year was the BBC’s head of political programming and was responsible for organising the corporation’s election debates.Labour-supporting campaigners also pointed to other high-profile appointments made by senior Tory ministers from the BBC as evidence that the corporation is currently biased towards the government.“The ball is in Labour’s court,” said a Downing Street source on Saturday.May has said she will only take part in a debate against Corbyn, not any hard Brexiter, such as Boris Johnson, or any campaigner for a second referendum, saying the country had moved on from the leave versus remain argument.She said her TV debate with the Labour leader would not be about the same arguments as the 2016 referendum, during which there were multiple live debates from all factions. Anti-Brexit campaigners have argued that excluding smaller parties from the debate is undemocratic.On Saturday evening the BBC said: “Our proposal is to broadcast a programme which includes both a head-to-head debate between the prime minister and the leader of the opposition and also an opportunity to hear from a wider range of voices. “After all, a broad range of views on this issue is held by the public and by parliamentarians – from those who want a different form of Brexit to those who want another public vote – and we believe that should be reflected in the debate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f7b1447f8f0ce5767151c0d53c1190096d1ab3d/0_212_5212_3127/master/5212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1a4521a3e1771bcc26d4db1d63e687a","title":"david lammy children windrush anthology interview","story":"The politician of the year on his Guyanese roots, faith in millennials – and his childhood dream of being Michael JacksonDavid Lammy, 46, is a Labour party politician, former minister and MP for Tottenham. Born to Guyanese parents, he was one of five children raised by his single mother in north London. He trained in the US at Harvard Law School and worked as a barrister, before entering politics. He was a leading voice in the call for justice after the Grenfell Tower fire he led the campaign for the home secretary to guarantee the citizenship of Commonwealth nationals after the Windrush scandal. He has written the foreword to a new anthology, Mother Country: Real Stories of the Windrush Children, and last week was named politician of the year by the Political Studies Association.Mother Country features poets, actors and playwrights, including Lenny Henry and Corinne Bailey Rae alongside a Windrush generation centenarian and other Caribbean Britons. Who do you hope will read it?I hope the book will be read by many and varied readers and that it becomes a staple on the bookshelves of black British homes across the country, but also that school libraries will draw on it, particularly for Black History Month events. The myriad themes that convey the modern black experience, and that run through the anthology, are fundamental to the understanding of modern Britain.Lenny Henry recalls Richard Pryor’s words on visiting Africa: “When you go to your home country, you feel your heritage run through your veins. You suddenly come alive.” What do you feel when you visit Guyana?I go every year and love the warmth, the smells, the food. My parents are no longer with us but I can feel them in the air. I take tremendous joy from watching my children sucking the flesh from a mango stone. I’m not sure I could do this job without that umbilical cord I have to the region I couldn’t be a black MP in Britain without keeping in touch. To put it in the context of the recent rise in hate crime and abuse directed at me, the Caribbean is like soul food.What do you read when you are off-duty from politics?I tend not to read fiction – I’ll read one novel a year during the summer – but I do read a lot of nonfiction. I’m in the business of ideas, and I skim a lot of books too. Afua Hirsch’s Brit(ish) was wonderful David Olusoga’s new book has prime position on my mantelpiece. Equally, I’ll read books whose opinions I won’t agree with, such as David Goodhart’s The Road to Somewhere because I don’t want to live in an echo chamber.At the age of 10 you were awarded a choral scholarship. Might you have been a singer in another life?When I was growing up, I wanted to be Michael Jackson. I used to sing and dance and perform with my sister at parties for 50p. There were a lot of things I thought of doing as I was growing up, from becoming a singer to a priest to a pilot. In the end I landed on law and now, as a politician, my job satisfaction remains tremendously high. I bounce out of bed to do the job but if I wasn’t doing it, I’d quite like to be teaching young people at sixth form or university.Do you still sing?I sing in the Parliamentary choir when I can, but this year has been so busy for me that I’m not in the Christmas choir. When I can get to practise, it’s like meditation after an hour of singing, I feel uplifted, clear-headed, connected.What music do you listen to?I have very eclectic tastes. I love soul and Motown I listen to some rap – Stormzy, Tinie Tempah, Drake. I also love classical music, American country and the folk tradition. I often start the day with gospel on my way to work. The only thing I have never got into is punk.As a politician, you have spent a lot of your professional life speaking passionately about the failings in society, but what heartens you?The millennials. I think they are a great generation who will do great things. We are all living longer and the baby boomers are still running the world, from Trump through to Theresa May. The millennials will have to fix a lot of things when they get hold of the levers of power, from climate change to the rise of right-wing politics, but I have every faith in them.I get ever so slightly irritated when I’m called passionate. How could you possibly not be passionate about the preventable death of 72 people in a burning inferno? How could you not be moved by innocent people who came to this country, who took so little and gave so much, and yet who were being deported for no reason? It should enrage most of us. The fact that I am described like that says much more about the establishment than it does about me.You are active on Twitter and have a big following. What do you think of it as a platform for debate?I would not be on it if I weren’t an MP. I’m not entirely sure it is good for your mental health. When I’m no longer an MP, I won’t be on it. I will happily be digging up earth in my garden. I only tweet an opinion now because my constituents and other people like them want to know what I think, and I’ve come to realise that a lot of people are heartened by it.Where do you want Britain to be in a year’s time?I would like to see us having taken the decision to remain in the EU and to press for reform, look outward and deal with the gross inequality in wealth, not just in my constituency or in London but in seaside towns and former northern industrial cities that need serious improvement and opportunity.What advice would you give to your younger self?Work on your resilience because you will get a lot of people telling you that you can’t do things at every stage: “You can’t be a lawyer” ‘“You can’t go to Harvard”“You can’t be an MP” “What do you mean you want to be a minister?” You have to work at your resilience. But there are also adults, most often who do not look like you,like teachers and youth workers, who can help and support you. You have to throw off any pride and ask for help.• Mother Country: Real Stories of the Windrush Children, edited by Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff, is published by Headline (£20).

The report was hailed by Jacob Rees-Mogg as the alternative to Theresa May’s proposals.The Charity Commission told the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) to remove Plan A+: Creating a prosperous post-Brexit UK from its website and stop promoting the report.A statement from the watchdog said the report had “overstepped the line of what is permissible charitable activity”.Published in September, it had staunch backing from leading Brexiters including David Davis, Boris Johnson and former Treasury minister Greg Hands. Rees-Mogg, chair of the European Research Group (ERG) of Tory Brexiters, described it as the “most exciting contribution” to the debate in months.The report advocated ditching May’s Chequers plan in favour of a Canada-style free trade deal and a new Anglo-Irish agreement to preserve an open border with Northern Ireland. A new law would make it an offence to export to the “Irish market” in breach of the new arrangements.However, the charities watchdog said its contents were “not sufficiently balanced and neutral as required of an educational charity under charity law. We also found that the charity had been undertaking political activity not in line with the charity’s purposes.” The Charity Commission’s intervention prompted a robust response from the IEA which said it was “concerned” about the decision, yet agreed to remove the report from its website and stop promoting its contents.“We believe it is increasingly unclear what charitable thinktank activity is acceptable, and what is not,” said Neil Record, chairman of the IEA board of trustees, who also revealed it was looking at setting up a non-charitable arm.The saga has caused such consternation to the watchdog, a non-ministerial government department, that it will write to all charitable thinktanks in England and Wales to “remind them of their duties as trustees to ensure that they comply with the law”.David Holdsworth, the commission’s deputy chief executive, said: “Charitable thinktanks are first and foremost charities and need to behave as such. It is disappointing that the trustees of some charitable thinktanks appear not to fully understand their duties.”The development is not the first time the thinktank has been the subject of interest from the Charity Commission. In July the  and Greenpeace UK published an undercover investigation into the IEA’s work in the “Brexit influencing game”.The thinktank had been offering potential US donors access to ministers as it raises funding for research to support the free trade deals demanded by hardline Brexiters.Greenpeace secretly recorded the IAE’s director, Mark Littlewood, saying it was “in the influencing game” and gave the recording to the , which in July prompted the Charity Commission to open a regulatory compliance case into the IEA on the basis of concerns about its political independence.The IEA strongly defended its position, stating that donations were for research purposes and it made “no apology for seeking to raise funds”.Greenpeace deputy director Ben Stewart said: “For too long the IEA has wanted to have all the benefits of being a charity without the responsibilities. It seems they wanted to have their cake and eat it.“The Charity Commission has now told them they can’t. We await with great interest the commission’s report into our investigation.”The statement from the IEA also expressed concern that the commission was in danger of pushing its powers too far. “A worrying precedent is in the process of being set: research papers – and their launches – which put forward firm policy proposals may now fall outside the parameters of what the Charity Commission considers acceptable activity,” it said ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b69f17c524bd27a7bd788b24d9339cf3cc64fbc7/0_0_3431_2059/master/3431.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d82810760d694b2122343c7ab048db0a","title":"may v corbyn on brexit the debate over the debate","story":"BBC, ITV or stepping aside for a celebrity edition of The Chase? Whatever, you don’t get to decideWith little over a week to go until parliament votes on Theresa May’s Brexit deal, one issue is taking up a disproportionate amount of time among Westminster’s political advisers and the nation’s broadcasters: arguing over the format of a proposed hour-long televised debate between the prime minister and Jeremy Corbyn.While the real business of selling the deal to MPs continues in parliament, the political and media class are locked in debate over the debate format. This has now splintered into various strands of subsidiary debates, each of which plays to different issues and insecurities among the political class and the general public that have emerged during the Brexit process.There’s the debate over whether the BBC is too close to the government and is too willing to work with the Conservatives to refine its format and secure the broadcast. There’s the debate over whether supporters of a hard Brexit or a second referendum should be represented during the broadcast or whether it should simply feature the two main party leaders. And, perhaps most importantly, there’s the debate over whether broadcasters can justify ripping up a Sunday night TV schedule filled with popular light entertainment shows for a dry debate about politics.This has led advisers at the top of the two largest political parties to ponder questions that are usually beyond their remit: would they be popular with the British public if the debate replaced an episode of David Attenborough’s Dynasties or a celebrity edition of The Chase?“These debates are elaborate displacement activity because they’re not actually dealing with the people who are voting,” said Craig Oliver, who as David Cameron’s director of communications led the painfully lengthy negotiations over debate formats during the 2015 general election. “I think Downing Street are trying to call Jeremy Corbyn’s bluff and show they have a position, while saying Corbyn doesn’t have a position.”The starting gun was fired on Sunday night when May’s aides briefed the Daily  that she would challenge Corbyn to a live television debate. Perhaps unexpectedly, Labour swiftly accepted the challenge in principle, prompting a swiftly arranged beauty contest in which the BBC, ITV and Sky News took turns to pitch to both major parties.Sky, aware of its relative size, offered to host a straightforward debate, presenting itself as a neutral host who would offer the footage to other bigger broadcasters. ITV promised a head-to-head on Sunday night with all the questions posed by Julie Etchingham and no studio audience.The BBC, knowing the threat posed by complaints about partiality, said its debate would be hosted in Birmingham and would include 10 prominent supporters of May’s deal and 10 opponents who would have the chance to ask questions, a format which Labour felt was “messy and confusing” – while also giving May the chance to paint her opponents as squabbling among themselves.On Tuesday night Labour let it be known it wanted the ITV option. But the following morning the BBC and Downing Street confirmed they had agreed terms, with both challenging Labour to participate in the event on the public broadcaster. Absolutely no one was happy, with Labour feeling the BBC was attempting to bounce it into accepting a format which played to May’s strengths.“The format with the most integrity is the ITV one,” said Oliver. “The BBC one is an overly elaborate mechanism that will be unlikely to have anything other than heat in it, it will just be a vehicle for soundbites.”Claims of skulduggery abound. Labour and the rival broadcasters all claim that Downing Street had been in discussions with the BBC for several weeks before they publicly proposed holding the televised head-to-head. They base this on a leaked media planning grid published at the start of the November which shows the party had planned a one-on-one interview with David Dimbleby for the prime minister.Under this theory, May’s challenge to Corbyn was a quick media headline which accidentally spiralled into something bigger when Labour accepted. Rival broadcasters also mutter over the influence of May’s head of communications, Robbie Gibb, who until last year was the BBC’s head of political programming and was responsible for organising the corporation’s election debates – which May chose to skip.As things stand, there is still no agreement for a programme pencilled in for Sunday 9 December. “The ball is in Labour’s court,” said a Downing Street source. The expectation is that Corbyn’s team will eventually have to cave in and accept the BBC proposal – perhaps aided by the corporation’s head of current affairs, Fran Unsworth, making further concessions on the number of people on the panel – or look as though they are running scared.The only thing that both the Conservatives and Labour can agree on is that they want to exclude smaller political parties from the stage, prompting furious complaints from the SNP and the People’s Vote campaign. Meanwhile, Channel 4 could be tempted into producing a cheeky spoiler programme featuring other sides of the debate.Oliver insists that no one in the UK has yet found the best format for a discussion between political leaders: “What we realised about the television debate format is that they are not debates, they are vehicles to deliver messages. Basically you just get up there with a whole series of points and work out how you’re going to land them.”He said this was especially pronounced when ITV ended up hosting a discussion featuring seven leaders during the 2015 election: “David Cameron went down the line and said ‘you want to raise taxes, you want to raise taxes’. We had planned it and he did it. It becomes a basic method of message delivery rather than a real debate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f034d7537d5c1177646b18698586744629fe022c/0_249_5119_3073/master/5119.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e59a92fc33b7849045b7647a87eb6b04","title":"rightwing thinktank deletes offer of access to ministers for donors","story":"Adam Smith Institute offered £1,000 donors invites to ‘power lunches and patrons dinners’One of the UK’s most influential rightwing thinktanks has deleted passages from its website promising access to government ministers in exchange for donations after the  began making inquiries about its funding.The Adam Smith Institute, a neoliberal thinktank credited with inspiring some of the most controversial privatisations of the Thatcher and Major governments, offered invitations to “power lunches and patrons dinners with influential figures, including politicians, ministers, journalists and academics” to anyone donating £1,000 a year.The regulator, the Charity Commission, said on Friday that it had started examining the institute’s accounts for “potential areas of non-compliance” with accounting rules.It is the second rightwing thinktank whose conduct is being examined by the commission for possible breaches of the rules.Earlier this year the chief executive of the Institute of Economic Affairs was filmed by an undercover reporter appearing to promise a potential donor access to a minister in exchange for funding a report on agribusiness. The group says it is “spurious to suggest that the IEA is engaging in any kind of ‘cash for access’ system” and denies wrongdoing.The Adam Smith Institute is made up of three different entities: a British company, a British charity and an American non-profit foundation, each with different rules on tax and the ability to carry out political activity.In a 2012 book, Madsen Pirie, one of the institute’s founders, said: “It was a very messy patchwork and it took us years to sort it out. We used the term ‘Adam Smith Institute’ loosely to cover all our activities, no matter which heading they occurred under.”Charities, which enjoy support from the British taxpayer, are required to be genuinely independent from other entities.There are strict rules on how charities can spend their funds. Research and education are acceptable as long as they do not set out to promote a particular viewpoint, but political campaigning is banned. began making inquiries about the UK charity’s financial relationship with the UK company last week. By Wednesday several passages on the institute’s website had been deleted, including the sentence: “We are a registered charity in the UK.” A lengthy passage describing a “two-pronged strategy for changing the world” was also deleted, as well as a section listing benefits for the institute’s financial backers. It is unclear why this was done.Those contributing £1,000 a year were offered “opportunities to attend power lunches and patrons dinners with influential figures, including politicians, ministers, journalists and academics.”Donors paying £5,000 a year were promised “a private events list, from which you can choose the Power Lunches and Patrons dinners you wish to attend.”Financial accounts indicate that between at least 1993 and 2002 the UK company ASI Research was regularly loaned thousands of pounds by the UK charity Adam Smith Research Trust. The company began filing abbreviated accounts after 2002, making it impossible to see if the loans continued.A spokesperson for the Adam Smith Institute explained that the UK charity reimbursed the UK company for costs it incurred in the course of business as a non-profit service company, rather than making grants.“While it seems this structure was a common one some decades ago, it can on occasion lead to imbalances and hence the loan account that appeared in the 1990s,” the spokesperson said. “This complied with the advice of lawyers and accountants at the time and was fully reported in the public accounts of both bodies.”The Charity Commission said: “All trustees of all charities must ensure they preserve their charity’s independence and make decisions that are solely in furtherance of their charity’s purposes.“The public rightly expect trustees of charities to take these responsibilities seriously, and demonstrate accountability to the public for the way in which their charity is governed, and the work their charity undertakes.“An important factor in demonstrating transparency is ensuring financial accounts are compliant with the accounting framework. We can confirm that we are examining the Adam Smith Research Trust’s financial accounts to examine potential areas of non-compliance with that framework.”The development comes amid questions about the political campaigning activities of a network of thinktanks and groups linked to an address in Tufton Street in Westminster."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c7c95dcdc1761d2dcf7f70d40e65400a0c80dd4/0_168_4517_2710/master/4517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4097bfb6f6129665598679f98fcfe38f","title":"shinzo abe to theresa may avoid a no deal brexit eu","story":"Japanese prime minister hints that crashing out of EU could hurt foreign investment in UKShinzo Abe has told Theresa May to avoid a no-deal Brexit, hinting that investors from Japan need predictability and stability.Speaking before a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Argentina, the Japanese prime minister said he wanted to “pay tribute” to May’s leadership in securing the deal. But, he went on, any prospect of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal risked international consequences.Japanese investors have repeatedly said the UK could lose its standing as the country’s preferred “gateway to Europe” in the event of no deal, which could disrupt supply chains.The president of Toyota said last month that a no-deal Brexit should be avoided at all costs.Honda warned that a no-deal Brexit would cost it tens of millions of pounds in additional tariffs and would damage the competitiveness of its Swindon plant. And Nissan, which employs 7,000 at Britain’s biggest car factory in Sunderland, has said that a sudden change to World Trade Organization rules would have “serious implications for British industry”.Car manufacturers are particularly exposed to any disruption to trade because of their “just-in-time” supply chains constantly moving parts around Europe.May did not directly engage with Abe’s warning, saying her negotiated deal was “a good deal for businesses in the UK, including the many Japanese companies who have made significant investment into the UK and who will be able to continue on the basis of our deal to trade well with the European Union”.Abe was not the first world leader to raise the prospect of uncertainty over May’s Brexit deal. In an earlier bilateral meeting, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, acknowledged May had a difficult situation to navigate.He politely described May as dealing in “typical British fashion” with “a very tough set of issues”.“I think you’ve shown great resilience and great determination on one of the most vexed issues I think there is,” he went on, a diplomatic reference to her domestic struggles.Downing Street said the bilateral discussions were on trade and security, including “work to lay the foundations for an ambitious future UKAustralia free trade agreement”.No 10 has said trade is the focus of all but one of May’s seven meetings with G20 leaders at the summit – the exception being the meeting on Friday with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, where the topics were the war in Yemen and the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d47fa9912279cc8195902c316a1c03fed961b53a/794_333_3106_1863/master/3106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f001be27e0b666be38499c595009210e","title":"theresa may 20 brexit deal house of commons","story":"PM is steadfastly saying she has no plan B, but other leaders are starting to sound uneasyWhen Theresa May addressed reporters on her RAF Voyager plane en route to the G20, she wore an eye-catching bracelet that appeared to depict the Great Wave off Kanagawa, the famous Japanese painting of a tsunami. Hokusai’s famous painting depicts a huge wave threatening three small boats, whose fishermen look calm and decisive.It could hardly have been a more appropriate metaphor for May’s approach to this summit, which could be her last as a national leader if her mutinous backbenchers get their way in the Brexit vote next week. The latest analysis suggests more than 100 Tory MPs could vote against her deal.In public, she has steadfastly maintained to other leaders that her Brexit deal is the blueprint for Britain’s post-Brexit future as an independent trading nation, and to reporters that there is no plan B for losing the vote in parliament.It is a message devoid of the context that her version of the deal looks likely to be voted down in parliament by more than half of the backbenchers in her own party, many of whom have based their opposition on the belief that the backstop provision threatens the opportunity to forge trade deals. During the summit, yet another minister – Sam Gyimah – resigned, refusing to back the deal.Yet when pressed on how the government is preparing for plan B, May has stressed that none exists, and that she is focused on winning the vote in parliament on 11 December.“Everyone said we would not get a deal, and now we’re in the position of having a deal, all you seem to want to be asking about is the next stage,” she told reporters on the plane. “We haven’t had the vote yet. Let’s focus.”“It’s a long flight,” one journalist quipped as the prime minister finished up her press briefing. “Will you spend any time working up a plan B in case the vote falls?”Throughout the two-day summit correspondents have repeatedly asked if it might be seen as irresponsible to have no plan in place for a second vote, a renegotiation offensive, for an offer to the Labour party or for a commitment to pursue no deal.Each time May has deflected. It is a deliberate strategy by No 10 to focus minds on the vote in parliament as the real moment of truth. They believe that without convincing colleagues that beyond defeat lies only chaos, the prime minister loses vital leverage.During the summit, May met with leaders from countries that Britain hopes to forge not only new trading relations but also security partnerships, including collaboration on a new satellite system to rival the EU’s Galileo project, which the UK has now formally pulled from its defence programme.Only one bilateral was not focused on trade, according to No 10: May’s meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, where the focus was Yemen and the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.It was the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, who first raised the elephant in the room – that the deal May was here to promote was no foregone conclusion. He politely described it as dealing in “typical British fashion” with “a very tough set of issues”.“I think you’ve shown great resilience and great determination on one of the most vexed issues I think there is,” he went on, a diplomatic reference to her domestic struggles, which he called “a very difficult issue for you and your colleagues”.In her next bilateral with Japan’s Shinzo Abe, one of the world leaders who May had hoped would be most supportive, Abe warned in his opening remarks that the UK must avoid no deal “to ensure transparency, predictability as well as legal stability in the Brexit process”.When May returns to the UK, Downing Street sources said she would not embark on any major tour of the country to sell her deal. Her focus will be on SW1, where she is expected to speak in the parliamentary debates and ramp up a charm offensive to convince Tory colleagues.For now, those are the people she really needs to convince, not the national leaders gathered in Buenos Aires."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8972b2ee7d34262e20ff18a051389a3199cb5e82/0_49_2015_1209/master/2015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e70f3375f3906c872f686610d33d3a0b","title":"everything must go what next for the high street new retail empty shops","story":"Out-of-town shopping centres and online giants decimated our town centres – what can local spaces still offer that the internet can’t?It’s not as if no one saw it coming. The decline of physical shopping, the business of getting yourself to an actual place and receiving actual goods from an actual person in return for actual cash, has been predicted – prematurely, as it turned out — since the end of the last century. It was not news in 2011 when David Cameron’s government appointed the retail consultant and broadcaster Mary Portas as a “high street tsar”, in an attempt to reverse their failing fortunes. Still less was it news in 2017, when the pitifully tiny £1.2m that she was given to revive 12 “pilot” towns unsurprisingly failed, with 969 units having closed during the initiative.One could choose other landmarks along the journey, the point in 2015, for example, when Amazon surpassed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the United States, or the moment in February when it came to be worth 2.5 Wallmarts. This year, in Britain at least, has been a particularly bleak one for those businesses that somehow seemed part of the national furniture. Well known names such as Toys R Us, Maplin, Debenhams, House of Fraser, Evans Cycles and Mothercare have been either shrunk or terminated, with 85,000 retail jobs lost in the first nine months of 2018. One symptom could be found on Black Friday, the hideous sales-boosting device imported from the US. Over there, on the day after Thanksgiving, shoppers are beating down the doors in search of bargains. Over here, despite the lack of a national meaningful date or public holiday, they have been encouraged to do the same. The only problem is that, this year, the sales generated by Black Friday are more and more heading online.One by one, the things that used to be done only by shops have been picked off. Travel agencies, video rentals, banks and bookshops are now joined on the endangered list by takeaways, which might have been thought an imperishable fixture, thanks to delivery services such as Deliveroo. It would be dumb to foretell their complete demise, especially in high-value places like the west end of London, but shops, like CDs and DVDs, like typewriters, film photography and answering machines before them, are losing their quality of inevitability.The difference with shopping is that its departure is leaving behind swaths of redundant urban fabric. The identity and self-esteem of entire towns and city districts is wrapped up with retail – what, for example, is a “market town” if it doesn’t have a market? As it has become ingrained that one of the main forms of shared public life is shopping, its loss becomes an existential threat to society. The idea is summed up in the phrase “high street”, which carries with it ideas of locality and community, but is also routinely used as shorthand for “shopping”. The term “high street brands” gets applied to chains of stores that have no presence in high streets, but only in shopping centres and malls.The resulting voids will be of the scale of those left by the closure of docks and factories, with the difference that those left by retail will often be in the centres of towns and cities. A fundamental turning around is in prospect of the ways that towns and cities are inhabited. It might, for example, lead to yet more centripetal and atomised forms of existence, a world of cocoons, as physically isolated as they are digitally connected. It might, to look on the bright side, lead to a rediscovery of the things we like about human contact. For it required an impoverished view of civic life that it ended up being so dependent on shopping. And it is because the pleasures of shopping had become so meagre that it became vulnerable to takeover by the internet.It is important, in the great sweep of things, to distinguish between different types of physical shopping. There are markets, high streets, shopping centres, department stores, retail parks and megamalls. Until now, these types have tended to be at war with one another – the battle of the high street against the mall has been going for decades – and they still are, even though they all have a common rival in the internet. They are likely to have different fates of different significance: what happens when a town centre loses its life and purpose counts for more than the disappearance of an out-of-town mall, which mostly leaves a brownfield site that might be used for, say, housing. It is also important to note differences between geographical locations and levels of prosperity. Dwellers in big cities have certain kinds of relationship to what might be called their high streets those of rural towns have another.What you hear from more or less everyone concerned with physical retail is that the future lies in offering things that the internet can’t, in providing for the needs of humans as social and embodied beings. Just as the retreat of other media has created nostalgic reactions – for vinyl, for film, for manual typewriters – so retail experts now like to talk about the importance of “experience”. This can mean, for example, what the now ex-tsar Mary Portas has called the “brand temples” by which Nespresso immerses customers in the world of coffee capsules, or Dyson in the world of domestic appliance, curated, calibrated environments in which the actual product is made precious by its lack of abundance.One of the more ebullient figures in the field is Lara Marrero, of the architects Gensler, for whom almost everything is positive. For her it’s less a case of death than reincarnation, the emergence of a bright new world in which a brand “is engaging its customers at every single touch-point”, in which physical spaces work with events and social media to enthral their followers. Here we are rewarded for surrendering “an incredible amount of value” – that is, the personal information we carelessly scatter about the internet – by being offered experiences perfectly tailored to our desires. After which, of course, we reward the brands for rewarding us by buying their products.In this new world, a brand’s chief marketing officer is “at the root of everything”, a maestro pulling the strings of data and desire. They can identify the wants not only of their clientele, but niches of that clientele, and then hold (for example) pop-up events that perfectly serve those wants. They can “own everything from start to finish and have a real community about it”.She talks, for example, of “Sephoria”, a two-day pop-up created by the cosmetics brand Sephora in Los Angeles, in which you could, as the blurb had it, “run wild through rooms brimming with one-of-a-kind beauty experiences”. You could get makeup masterclasses and customise products. You could “celebrate the often indescribable euphoria you get from playing in the vast world of beauty”, as Sephora also put it. You could enjoy “plenty of Instagrammable moments”, such that the whole giddy pageant of social media and lived moments could go tumbling on.As part of this discovery of “experience” tech companies have started to irrigate the landscape they previously helped to parch. Amazon, having caused countless bookshops to close, is now opening some of their own , with warm woody surfaces approximately as bookshops are supposed to have. Amazon also acquired the Whole Foods organic supermarket chain, with its wholesome and enticing produce. Apple have started calling their stores “town squares” and are trying to shape the public realm around them.All those aspects of being human, in other words, that somehow got mislaid in the evolution of shopping from market to high street to mall to internet, that is to say sensuality, sociability, enfranchisement and exploration, the possession of a body and existing in nature, are to be reinstated by fast-moving brands and their wizarding CMOs, made omniscient by the personal data they have harvested from us. And, to the extent that physical retail had become a cheerless activity conducted in skimpily decorated and harshly lit boxes, good luck to them. I am happy for whatever happiness the citizens of Sephoria found in its two-day existence, and pleased if retail gets back some of the creativity that it had in the glory days of department stores.Observer readers will, however, have spotted the snag, which is that Apple or Amazon are not the same thing as the civic s of the public realm that we had before. The citizens of Stockholm spotted this too, when they opposed Apple’s plans to colonise, in the nicest possible way, one of the city’s squares. A new Amazon bookshop does not substitute for the multiple forms and idiosyncrasies that you get from a mixed economy of independents and chains. It is a rehydration, a low-res digital copy, a bookshop-droid. It might be asked too if a city of niches and pop-ups, of short-lived singularities, is going to fill the gaps left by old-fashioned shops.There are, luckily, more everyday forms of “experience” than these high-concept productions. If the hardware store that Ken and Sue Greenwood run in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, is a long away from Sephoria, they too ascribe the fact that their 27-year-old business is “holding its own” to the provision of something you can’t get on a computer. In this case it is “service”, cutting keys and fitting blinds, and the fact that “people know they can rely on us. The staff has always been there.” They also note that it is shops offering services – hairdressers, beauty salons – that are opening up in the town, which is one of those Portas Pilots for which one-twelfth of the government’s £1.2m wasn’t enough to make much difference. It is an observation that accords with national figures that show that such businesses are doing better than most, and with a belief of Lara Marrero’s that local high streets can also join in her bright new world of experience. She also thinks that there should be more places for fitness and communal gaming, which would require a change in the planning policies that currently stop shops from being converted to these uses.For Bill Grimsey, a former CEO of Iceland who now publishes reports about the future of the high street, every town has the ability to reinvent itself as “something bigger than shops”. Retailers “spent the whole of the last century cloning every town and it doesn’t work. Zara, John Lewis: how boring is that?” Rather, he says, they can draw on their inidual identities, on local produce, heritage, culture, art and crafts, to attract people. “Every town can be its own Disneyworld,” he says. “Every town can be its own ‘wow.’”If this sounds optimistic, he offers the example of Stockton-on-Tees, which “should be bottled up and taken to every town centre in the country.” Here, according to the local council’s chief executive Neil Schneider, “we decided to reacquaint ourselves with our history”, which means not only its role in the birth of railways but seven centuries as a market town. Historic buildings were revived. An amphitheatre, equipped for theatrical lighting and sound, was created in the re-landscaped town centre. A programme of events – performance, music, cycling, a car show – was launched. New independent shops are incubated. Activities – classes in pottery or sewing for example – are offered as well as products. New homes are being built so that people can live in the centre.“The most difficult bit is public expectation,” says Schneider. “If you haven’t got a high street with a Marks \u0026amp Spencer or a John Lewis, then it’s failing. But that’s not true.” This could indeed be the moment to pause and ask if shopping should actually characterise cities to the extent that it does. Not so long ago, commentators used to reflect on how everything – museums, airports, railway stations, Unesco world heritage sites – was becoming one great tissue of retail. Hands were wrung over its influence. Hard-up towns like Hastings and Hull felt obliged to trade their assets – a delightful cricket ground in the centre of the former, and expanses of water in the heart of the latter – for the financial benefits of shopping centres. If these decisions seemed questionable when they were made, they would be more so now.London’s Oxford Street, for one, could be set free. For decades, proposals have come and gone – monorails, pedestrianisation – for civilising Oxford Street, whose problems arise from its being too narrow for the crowds it attracts. But what if its multistorey volumes of retail diminished, leaving showrooms at ground level and places to live and work above? There would be fewer, calmer, happier people, a more enriching range of life, and no need for ambitious traffic engineering.Geoff Mulgan, chief executive of the National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts (Nesta), considers “what you would do if you were designing a city from scratch”. You would have “learning zones” (by which he means areas shaped around universities) and neighbourhoods suited to ageing populations, and layouts designed to encourage public health through walking and through access to healthy eating. These elements would not be hermetically sealed from one another but open and connected.This sounds quite like a traditional city – Oxford, say – give or take some adjustment for the greater scale of modern life. It would be a challenge, as Mulgan says, to retrofit it into existing fabric, but not an insuperable one. Tŷ Pawb, the arts centre formed within an underused market building in Wrexham, gives an idea how it might be done.Much of the repurposing of retail space can come from the bottom up, if it is allowed to. As happened with abandoned warehouses, new life occupies the slack space, made possible by low or nonexistent rents. The types are well-known – startups, artists’ studios, pioneer cafes, co-operative housing – but none the worse for that. An organisation called the Empty Shops Network, now 10 years old, helps artists and performers reuse redundant spaces. Among those they have helped is the Shopfront theatre in Coventry, formed out of an old fish and chip restaurant. In Elephant and Castle and Seven Sisters market, in south and north London respectively, shops and stalls serving the specific needs of local communities grew up in the margins left by what were (in commercial terms) unsuccessful shopping centres. Both, however, have been threatened with destruction precisely because they were considered commercially unsuccessful.Forms of sociability that do not rely on the adrenaline of consumption and events might also grow up. Might an empty shop, with minimal expenditure, become an informal library, stocked with second-hand books and DVDs, a gentle alliance of old tech devices and architecture, possibly for old-ish people? Or might it be just a public living room or informal club in which you might escape the isolation of private space? Might planters be permitted on the pavement, tended by the users of the different premises? Places like Bonnington Square in south London, a 1970s squat that is now a verdant tourist attraction, show how this can be done.If a high street had a number of such places it would become a truer community than one where people are rushing between chain stores. Which is not to say that this, or any of the other bright ideas about retail space will happen easily or everywhere. A lot of retail space is in the form of large, sealed black boxes, which make them less adaptable than characterful Victorian warehouses. Middle-sized shopping centres in town centres, with no special character, will be especially challenging.The government has again decided that something must be done. “The British have taken to online shopping like no other nation on Earth,” said the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in advance of his recent budget, in which he promised £1.5bn of help to small retailers.He delivered in his measured tones the same message as breathy brand consultants, that it’s not about stuff any more, but experience: “The high street of the future frankly will have fewer retail outlets and more leisure destinations, more food and drink outlets.”This is all sane and fine, although there was criticism that the £1.5bn wasn’t enough. But there is something bigger here, which is to make, as the old saw has it, an opportunity out of a problem. Rather than a rearguard action in defence of something we may not miss that much, there is a chance to revive what is actually good about towns and cities. If the retail kraken is enfeebled, it is time to escape its tentacles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e96976ed1b109bd7a299ec3b77d4cf4ea9625bb/0_141_4608_2764/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9870d065f0a9bde9e017a99fea60afdb","title":"teenage boys and young men tell us what issues matter to you","story":"We want to hear from young men living in the UK for a project exploring the issues most important to youWhat’s it like for teenage boys and young men growing up in the UK?

Jantjies struck in the 79th minute to edge Rassie Erasmus’s side ahead in the dying stages of an entertaining match the Pumas will wonder how they managed to lose.Argentina were comfortably in charge for most of the first half but ended the match with 17 penalties against. They led by 21 points after half an hour and 14 at half-time but the Barbarians, with a distinctly South Africa feel, were markedly improved after the break to ensure the Pumas finish their autumn campaign with four defeats.It was an experimental Argentina side, coach Mario Ledesma making 10 changes, but if anything this defeat only serves to reinforce their lack of depth. There is plenty of cavalry for Ledesma to call on next year and they do tend to pick up in World Cup years but England and France, who occupy the same World Cup pool, will not be overly concerned on this evidence.The Barbarians got off to the perfect start with Juan Manuel Leguizamón, who has 63 caps for the Pumas, scored the opening try, collecting Schalk Brits’ offload and going over on the right. Handré Pollard nailed the tricky conversion but that was as good as it got for the invitational side for most of the first half.A concerted period of pressure from Argentina allowed Matias Orlando to outpace the Barbarians defence in the right corner before the Ramiro Moyano scored the Pumas’ second on the left, running on to a deft kick in behind from the fly-half Joaquín Diaz Bonilla. Again, the conversion was good from Bonilla, who played with poise throughout. That he is 29 years old and has only three caps highlights Ledesma’s biggest problem, however.The Pumas were on top by this stage and while Orlando was denied his second try on 19 minutes, tackled just short, the former Leicester flanker Pablo Matera was on hand to plunge over. The fourth try came just five minutes later with Moyano cutting infield off his left wing and kicking diagonally ahead for the right winger Sebastián Cancelliere to pounce.If the Barbarians had been struggling up until that point, they seized their moment towards the end of the first half and hit back with a penalty try after a driving lineout in which all 15 players piled into at some stage. It brought a beaming smile to Rassie Erasmus and had proved so effective that the Barbarians did it again early in the second half, this time Pollard coming up with the try.Suddenly the Barbarians were back to within seven, had emptied their bench and were starting to play. The Springbok wing Aphiwe Dyantyi brought the crowd to life with a dart down the left while Tommaso Benvenuti almost wriggled free on the right. The handling errors that had plagued the Barbarians in the first half continued however, and Argentina soon restored their 14-point advantage with Julián Montoya going over at the back of a driving maul.It was back to seven before the hour mark, Damian de Allende – so impressive here a few weeks ago against England – winning the foot race to Jantjies’s grubber and Argentina were increasingly holding on, as demonstrated by a flurry of penalties conceded. Indeed, Siya Kolisi’s influence was growing, as was that of his compatriots De Allende and Jesse Kriel and it was the latter’s break up the middle that led to Lood de Jager going over to level things up at 35-35 with four minutes to go.Jantjies then saw his opportunity and took it, giving a lasting reminder of just how effective late drop goals can be and providing some late drama for the 31,000 fans in attendance. Hardly a bumper crowd – double were here last year for the match against New Zealand – which says a lot about the pull of the All Blacks and plenty about how cluttered the international calendar has become. Victories like these then, are all the more important for the Barbarians’s future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7f8917b0d9a3bae4ba56000b132deb6f1da8d46/24_164_2478_1487/master/2478.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a158e02091994f0469ec325c7b7c73d","title":"saracens wasps premiership match report","story":"One of the Premiership’s runaway leaders falters, the other strides out with a certain inevitability. Saracens go top, the only team left unbeaten, nine from nine. Their unbeaten run in all competitions extends to 20, their last defeat being to Leinster in the quarter-finals of Europe in April.They were a long way from their best, a somewhat makeshift line-up in this awkward weekend between the autumn internationals and Europe, but they had too much for a similarly unfamiliar Wasps team. This was not the try-fest of last season’s Premiership play-off between these two, but the dominance of the one side over the other was very much the same, even if it took a while to translate into points. “I’m most pleased that we didn’t become frustrated by the territory and possession we had,” said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall.Alex Lozowski, who had won the kicking audition over Alex Goode in the absence of Owen Farrell and Ben Spencer, collected 19 points, landing seven from seven. Having excelled on the wing last week, he moved into the centre this, where he is happiest. England will surely not have ruled him out of further involvement just yet.Opposite him was another England international, Elliot Daly, whose coach also described him as happiest in the No13 shirt, even if England are playing him at full-back these days. Further evidence of his discomfort in the No15 role was supplied by his gifting Saracens a late try to seal the win, covering back to field Lozowski’s long clearance and flinging the ball infield to Nick Isiekwe for a simple try.These were not the only England internationals to feature. Jamie George won man of the match, but Maro Itoje cannot have been far off. Meanwhile, Nathan Hughes was making his first appearance for Wasps since his ill-fated punch-tweet combination. It looked as if he had a few issues to work through his system. He left the field late on, but Dai Young, Wasps’ director of rugby assured us he was just winded.Hughes quickly became Saracens’ chief concern. After a few early looseners, his carrying started to punish them, but the champions’ line held. Wasps’ only points of the first half came courtesy of a remarkable Daly penalty, which cleared the bar by several metres from 55 out. That was one of only two penalties they were awarded in the opening period, both at scrums. Alas, Wasps conceded nine in the same time, three of them from scrums too. Eight were awarded at that set piece, 5-3 in Saracens’ favour, so no one was the wiser.Lozowski landed three penalties to establish a 9-3 lead at the break. The game deserved a try. Hughes had a threatening gallop, as did Itoje, who also ruled the lineout, Goode and Richard Wigglesworth, who combined beautifully with Sean Maitland down the right. Each clean break resulted in either a penalty or a handling error, of which there were a few.Still the lines held, even when Saracens drove a lineout at the start of the second half, having sent their fourth penalty from a scrum to the corner. Hughes’s enormous arms were under the pile to deny George. Daly pulled Wasps back to within three with a penalty, this time from a mere 45 metres, only for Lozowski to slot his fourth.The game by then deserved a try a little less but needed one desperately. It came on the hour. Lima Sopoago kicked straight out, and Saracens mounted the decisive assault from the lineout. Lozowski and Matt Gallagher made breaks, Saracens could smell the tryline, and Goode worked George over it, into the corner.Lozowski’s fifth penalty followed, before the game was finally sealed by that second for Saracens. Daly scampered back most of the length of the field to collect a wicked Lozowski clearance. He stepped the first chaser but then flung the ball into the path of the next, Isiekwe, who merely had to catch and flop over the line.McCall expressed his surprise that Saracens and Exeter have managed to put so much distance between them and the rest. To everybody else, it feels the natural order, and Saracens’ opening of some space at the top all the more so.

From Christmas cocktail parties to sit-down dinners, here’s how to host with impact and ease this seasonThe nights have drawn in, George and Mariah are in a state of perpetual soundclash, and with them comes the unsettling urge to host a seasonal get-together.If you’re an unsteady host, even an intimate dinner with a handful of friends can seem daunting, so when you chuck in the plus-ones, her next door and a cluster of colleagues, that “fun and festive” party can start to feel anything but.But things don’t need to get all out of control and Abigail’s Party. We live in a time when fine dining and Michelin-starred chefs appear in the most casual of settings, and that informality extends to the at-home-host, too. Claude Bosi - head chef of Bibendum restaurant and Rémy Martin cognac bar – is one such Michelin-starred chef who advocates this relaxed approach when entertaining.“The key to a great party,” he says, “is to ensure you are with your guests. There are so many dinner parties where you try to impress and find yourself spending more time in the kitchen than you spend with your guests. A great party is a balance between good food and good hospitality.”Here’s how it’s done:The dinner partyThis casual mantra starts at the top – the formalities of the past have been dispensed with. Invites can go out on WhatsApp or email. Similarly, boy-girl seating plans at dinner are a relic of another time. Remember, too, if there are only two single guests at a dinner party, they don’t necessarily want to be seated together, lest they feel like show ponies being watched over by the other guests for signs of good chemistry. And unless you have a particular gift for crafting, there’s no need for place names.That said, some small details done nicely can make a real difference. Take your dinner table, for example, as chef and caterer Stephanie Boote says: “I like a simple table, not too much fuss. A linen cloth can be lovely, napkins, if you have them. A couple of little vases or bottles with flowers or foliage. Candlelight is a must. You can have a pile of plates and cutlery on top of an undressed table, a water jug and a stack of glasses, and if you have candles lit it will all be just fine!”There are lots of ways to make life easier as you prep your dinner-party meal, especially as your guests arrive and the heat rises in the kitchen. For Bosi, a neat trick is to go for a cold starter. He suggests getting a terrine from a local deli and serving it with a salad, all handily ready to go on plates ahead of time.Food writer and author Killian Fox offers similar logic when feeding a crowd. “Simplify,” he says. “Instead of a starter, lay out a range of snacks – decent crisps and dips, olives, maybe some crostini – for people to eat when they come through the door. Use the time you’ve saved to make sure everyone has enough booze.”Drinks are, of course, key to a great dinner party. Leave time at the beginning for an aperitif, which will give you more breathing room to prepare your food, take account of inevitable late arrivals (“our Uber kept cancelling”) and let appetites build.Fox suggests a handy seasonal cocktail, too, named London Calling. “It was apparently devised at Milk \u0026amp Honey in Soho. It’s citrussy, it contains sherry, and it gives you a chance to look classy with a cocktail shaker. A fine Christmas drink.”Bosi suggests a drink can offer some surprises and lead to unexpected food pairings. He likes a Royal Sidecar, made with Rémy Martin 1738 Accord Royal cognac, Cointreau and lemon – and paired with oysters.“Until recently, cognac was something you would have after a great lunch,” he says. “It’s not something you’re expecting to drink at the start of the meal, but I find it goes very well with seafood. It’s a nice surprise, a bit of creativity. At that moment, you’ve made people really relaxed and given your meal a stamp of quality.”From then on, you can go with some classic dishes: a big joint of meat, a casserole that can be easily cooked in advance, a beautiful stew with game, or Bosi’s festive favourite: beef wellington.When it comes to serving, Bosi tends to stick to sharing plates. “I put pots in the middle of the table and we start sharing,” he says. “I think dinner parties with people closer to each other are a better atmosphere.”Boote adds a word of practical advice: “Preparation is key. Your guests are here to see you, not have you run about trying to do things. Keep it simple, with excellent ingredients that speak for themselves.”Dinner party music has long been something of a slur, a byword for a pleasant but bland background soundtrack. But you don’t want to be sitting in silence accompanied only by the sound of mastication and scraping forks, so head to Spotify to put together some playlists.For dinner, you want something that is eclectic but not too distracting – you don’t want to be continually flicking to the next song. However, you also don’t want to drift into nondescript tastefulness, either.The drinks partyInteresting people, nice snacks, some decent tunes and plenty of booze is all that’s needed for a drinks party. Keep things loose – this means submitting to the inevitable and assuming a crowd will congregate in your kitchen. Be ready to push some seats away in the living room if a late dance party emerges.When it comes to the drinks, try to be creative, says Boote: “This year, we have made a fig leaf syrup to go with lime juice, gin and soda. It’s delicious without the gin, too.” She follows that adding clementine flavours and fizz to spirits makes any drink feel “festive and delicious”.Of course, guests will be looking for something to nibble on, so lay out some decent crisps, popcorn or olives.You can also add some more expansive finger food into the mix. Boote goes for gougères, a French choux pastry filled with cheese, while Bosi will be serving up some intriguing offerings: Rémy Martin cognac, mixed with tonic (a Rémy Grand Tonic – the French spin on the British classic), served with his “pickled cockle popcorn”. The cockles are rolled in flour then deep-fried in hot oil, coming out as if popcorn. “It’s a fantastic pairing,” he says. To give it a seasonal twist, add some clove or orange to the cognac.Fox offers a snack serving with a backstory: “The Gilda – a pintxo created in honour of Rita Hayworth, who starred in the film Gilda. It’s pretty easy: skewer a couple of green olives on a toothpick with guindilla peppers and an anchovy fillet.”You want to keep the music equally eclectic but a little more upbeat. However, don’t feel the need to overload it with bangers and floor fillers. If the party goes late, you can bring out the hits. Remember to let a few people try out their music selections – it’s never fun to be overprotective of the music at a party, nor do you want one person hogging the speaker. Finally, if things take a particularly boozy turn, fire up some karaoke through YouTube.And finally …Really, there’s no set formula. Follow your instincts, embrace comfort and concentrate on having fun. And, if in doubt, remember some salient words from Bosi:“Just don’t try too hard. Don’t try to impress is the wrong thing to say – you want to impress – but stay in your comfort zone. Stay comfortable, enjoy yourself, keep it simple – and have a good time.”Make like Bosi and kick off that good time with a Royal Sidecar or Rémy Grand Tonic of your own – buy a bottle here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3726e0cf652a6dff90d706ddbed00a8be919ab9e/175_494_4443_2666/master/4443.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=730ac2405297defd496d7ac6d21e3183 1290w","title":"strictly come dancing week 11 live","story":"It’s Musicals Week as the competition headed towards the business end, and the contestants danced for a place in the semi finalsTime for a recap - my faves this evening were Lauren and AJ and Joe and Dianne – no idea who is going to be in tomorrow’s bottom two, things tend to get a bit unpredictable at this point. We’ll find out tomorrow at 7.20pm, so please join me then for some Sunday night Strictly fun. Thank you for joining in, and I’ll see you then!So Faye and Giovanni at the top of the leaderboard, and Lauren and AJ and Charles and Karen at the bottom. The voting lines are open!Scores: 8,9,9,10 - a total of 36 for Joe and Dianne. LOL. Bruno thought it had all the sparkly energy of the Salsa, with the magic of Joseph. Craig thought it lacked rotation in the hips, but he loved how theatrical it was. Darcey loved the conviction in Joe’s face, and she loved the lifts. Shirley thought it was an A star for presentation and it had great conviction - Joe made the whole thing his own.On a side note, I never did give the Dave Arch OrchestraSingers props for an incredible version of House Of Pain’s ‘Jump Around’ last week, it was spectacular. More 90s hip-hop please, I can’t believe nobody has ever done an American Smooth to ‘California Love’ by 2Pac ft. Dr Dre.Well this is quite rainbow-tastic, and Joe has gone HARD on the guyliner. I love this Salsa - it’s camp as Christmas and Joe has no hoots to give. Obviously as a Salsa it terrible in every respect, other than a very decent attempt at hip action, but I don’t care. Love Joe being lifted by Johannes, love the sheer joy and madness of this, love love love.And finally, it’s JOE AND DIANNE! This week they’re dancing the Salsa to ‘Joseph Megamix’ from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Ah yes, that famous Latin musical. I mean, how does one Salsa to Any Dream Will Do, or Close Every Door? We’re about to find out, and I for one am very afraid. Scores: 9,9,10,10 - a total of 38 for Stacey and Kevin.Genuinely just thought Claudia said “Stacey, your mum died”, but she actually said “Stacey, your mum DI”. Oh thank goodness, this is not the time or place for that kind of news.Can’t decide if I’m being a Debbie Downer this evening, or the judges are on something. Shirley is spouting poetry - it was seamless and she loved everything about it. Bruno is a crying mess, it was unforgettable and so special. Craig thought it wasn’t technically perfect, but it didn’t matter - it was real, honest and truthful (FYI those are all the same thing, Craig). Darcey thought it was a really impressive performance. I’m not sure which version of Fantine Stacey is supposed to be, but for some reason they’ve let her keep her teeth and hair. That said, am very much enjoying Kevin’s 80s New Romantic sleeves.Ooh, that spin looked a bit wonky, not sure what happened there. Lovely footwork from Stacey, but too much contempo-waft and not enough Foxtrot for my tastes. Oh, the judges are on their feet, just me then (again). Next up it’s STACEY AND KEVIN! This week they’re dancing the American Smooth to ‘I Dreamed a Dream’ from Les Misérables, because nothing says Saturday night family telly like the rock-bottom lament of a consumptive prostitute. Scores: 9,10,9,10 - a total of 38 for Ashley and Pasha. Darcey, you can’t have a criticism then give a ten, it renders the scoring system entirely pointless. Darcey thought it was demanding and difficult, but she had a tiny bend in her arm. Shirley loved the performance, but thought the choreography was too busy. Bruno thought it was a smash hit, and Ashley mastered it - the end sequence was breathtaking. Craig loved how fast and furious it was, despite the tiny bits of gapping. Train! DRINK! Loving Ashley’s fabulous salmon mousse dress, and obviously this Quickstep is incredible. Hard to tell which one of those dancers isn’t a professional. LOVED that. Quickstep of the year, probably.It’s time for ASHLEY AND PASHA! This week they’re dancing the Quickstep to ‘Don’t Rain on My Parade’ from Funny Girl. Last week Ashley was in the bottom two, at which point she probably realised that she should have pretended to be a bit more duff at dancing in the early weeks to give us a bit more J-word. Now of course it’s too late, and she’ll just have to settle for making the final and not actually winning. Don’t worry, Pashley, you’ll be in really good company."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce11fec1435267e12cb4865ff8bd8f5144369e3c/0_658_4745_2848/master/4745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03b1df73e12aa1f9108006fedf65a63b","title":"george hw bush a life in pictures","story":"George HW Bush, who has died aged 94, was the 41st president of the United States.

But in its heyday it made some of the finest household furniture in Italy. For generations of newlyweds looking to furnish their new homes, a visit to Cascina was a rite of passage.Hard-working and close-knit, the town’s politics were firmly to the left. In a small patch of green near the handsome 16th-century clocktower, Communist mayors erected monuments to those who died fighting Mussolini and the Nazis. After the fall of the Berlin wall, the Italian Communist party gradually morphed into the centre-left Democrats, but the Cascinese, by and large, stayed loyal.But over the past 20 years, most workshops have closed their doors. Some were unable to compete with the likes of Ikea others were finished off by the 2008 crash. The great exhibition hall, where the town’s finely crafted wardrobes, sideboards and chairs were laid out for prospective buyers to inspect, became a supermarket. Then, from 2011, a new challenge emerged as refugees who had made the crossing from Libya to Italy’s southern coast began to arrive.Two years ago, Cascina suddenly turned its back on seven decades of tradition and voted for a very different kind of politician. Susanna Ceccardi, the town’s 31-year-old mayor, is a rising star of the rightwing League party. For years an also-ran of Italian politics, the League is about to chalk up six months in coalition government following elections that routed traditional centre-ground parties and handed populists a landmark victory. Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister and leader of the League, has just made Ceccardi one of his chief advisers on security. Charismatic, confrontational and usually dressed in a leather jacket and jeans, Ceccardi is also the new party boss in Tuscany, where a Trumpian “Italians first” message is conquering great swathes of political territory. Pisa, Massa and Siena – traditional bastions of the left – all fell to centre-right and League candidates in local elections in the summer. Florence is the next target. According to Ceccardi, it is the League that now speaks to Italy’s anxieties and insecurities. A combination of economic stagnation, austerity and a migration crisis has swept old political certainties and affiliations away.“My grandparents were all communists,” she says, sitting in her mayoral office. “But I was born in 1987,” she says. “Two years later the Berlin Wall fell. So I feel no connection with those ideological battles between communism and fascism. During the election campaign here in Cascina, the left’s big theme was anti-fascism. They talked constantly about it – and they chose the wrong target because the League is not fascist. We talked to the people about real issues. The theme of dealing with mass immigration has nothing to do with fascism or anti-fascism. It’s about a problem people are experiencing in their everyday lives.”About 600,000 refugees and migrants have entered Italy since 2014. In Cascina, a town of 45,000, a few hundred who made it across the Mediterranean attempt to eke out a living, waiting in vain for something to turn up. Ceccardi has cancelled a government-funded project to integrate migrants by helping them with accommodation and work opportunities. “Those resources are needed for Cascina people,” she says. “Cascinesi first.”Non-Italians who request social housing are required to provide documentary evidence from their home country, proving they own no property there. For most, the likelihood of gaining access to such documents is close to zero. “People elected me to make sure Italians are first on the list for housing,” says Ceccardi.Twice a week an army Land Rover tours the town as part of the mayor’s new law and order strategy (one of Ceccardi’s nicknames is Lady Security). More police have been hired, with €30,000 (£26,000) spent on new uniforms. Free pepper spray canisters have been made available to women on request. “You only need to look at the prison population,” says Ceccardi, “to see the link between mass immigration and insecurity.” A local “welcome centre” for migrants, notorious for the squalor of its conditions, has been closed.Moses, 32, from Nigeria, who did not want to give his full name, has lived in Cascina for two years. “Life is a daily struggle,” he says. “I hoped to find farm work but there is no work here. People are unfriendly. It’s basically just me and God.” Most of his days, he says, are spent begging to find money to pay his rent.Ceccardi has waged a series of small culture wars with the local left, relentlessly attacking “buonisti” (do-gooders) – a favourite League target. Before becoming mayor she campaigned against a project to teach Cascina’s children the lyrics to John Lennon’s Imagine, a song she views as communist propaganda. Installed at the town hall, she has pressured schools to abandon the singing of traditional anthems of the Italian resistance such as Bella Ciao. “These songs are not really resistance songs any more,” she says. A local priest, Don Elvis, was condemned by a League councillor, now an MP, for providing free breakfasts for asylum seekers before mass on Sundays. The arts have also been targeted. Cascina’s theatre once specialised in experimental productions, often with a social message, but the actor and League supporter Andrea Buscemi became its president in August 2016 and changed the programme to standard Italian and European classics.Buscemi recently became embroiled in a row over the artistic merit of Pisa’s famous Tuttomondo mural, painted in 1989 on the wall of a church by the American artist Keith Haring. A colourful portrait of global solidarity – its name means “all the world” – the mural depicts different races reaching out to each other. In a polemic titled I Want Pisa Back, Buscemi condemns the mural as “utterly banal”. He also writes of “a strange suicidal tendency pushing Europe (and Italy) not only to open up its doors to whoever it might be, but also to forget to safeguard its own culture … In the ‘melting pot’ that follows globalisation, I see a precise ideological design being realised: the taking away of particularities of place … turning us all into migrants, without a homeland or borders or language.”These cultural skirmishes have their roots in a dark philosophy of history that senior League figures share with Marine Le Pen’s National Rally and Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz. “In the history of peoples,” says Ceccardi, “there isn’t one civilisation that didn’t have to defend itself. Think of the Mayans. Outsiders who were more powerful than they were arrived and defeated them. But in the past, beleaguered civilisations defended themselves. The only one which hasn’t is the western civilisation. Instead of defending ourselves, we say: ‘Come on in!’”As the Ceccardi revolution has unfolded in his home town, Michelangelo Berti, a teacher and Democratic party activist, has looked on with growing dismay. “In no time at all,” he says, “values which were the foundation of a cross-party consensus for 70 years are being demolished. Ideas of solidarity, tolerance, minority rights and moral obligation to those in need, even if it costs you something, have gone. The boundaries have been redrawn.”Western Europe’s first anti-establishment government is a strange hybrid. The original Northern League was formed in the 1990s to defend the interests and prejudices of small businesses in Italy’s north. Its cause celebre was a quixotic crusade to free “Padania”, a notional northern territory stretching from Umbria to the South Tyrol, from the fiscal demands of “Roma ladrona” – “thieving Rome”.Its coalition partner, the Five Star Movement (M5S), founded by the comedian Beppe Grillo in 2009 and led by Salvini’s fellow deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, has attracted support from both the right and the left. Electorally it has thrived in the south and among the young and unemployed, whose economic prospects have flatlined for a generation. In government, these odd bedfellows have found a vocation combining anti-austerity economics with, at times, outright xenophobia.The wildly unpopular Monti was succeeded by Matteo Renzi of the centre-left Democratic party in 2013. He promised to end austerity but did not, and failed to persuade the rest of Europe to properly share the burden of the migration crisis. When he called a constitutional referendum to consolidate his power and lost, the storm broke. The consequences, for Italy and Europe, are now playing themselves out. Sabres have been rattled on both sides. This month, the EU’s economics chief, Pierre Moscovici, warned there could be no compromise. In echoes of 2011, the ratings agency Moody’s has downgraded the country’s debt to one rung above junk status.Massimo Tamburri, a marketing consultant and M5S activist in the town of Ascoli Piceno in central Italy, says: “What we are attempting here is the most far-reaching experiment in the world. This is taking on the financialised capitalism that has held sway for so long. We’re being called stupid, crazy, and we’re being told to shut up. But we will see.“When was the last time a government commanded this kind of approval? And it’s a government that is constantly under attack by the mainstream media.”Since May, Salvini has energetically pursued numerous high-profile confrontations abroad and at home. In June, using his powers as minister of the interior, he caused an international outcry by closing Italy’s ports to NGO-operated ships carrying migrants and refugees. In the same month he denounced the mayor of a Calabrian town who had actively welcomed migrants.In July, Salvini filed a lawsuit for defamation against the author Roberto Saviano, one of the fiercest critics of his authoritarian style. Saviano responded to the announcement of legal action by accusing Salvini of being “afraid of critical voices”. The deputy prime minister also appeared to hint  on national radio that the author’s police protection, granted following mafia death threats, might be removed.When a security bill was introduced that proposed a 9pm curfew on “ethnic” shops, which Salvini claimed had become “meeting places for drunkards, pushers and hell-raisers”, opposition MPs compared the move to the politics of 1930s Germany. Last month a League mayor in the northern town of Lodi was accused of “apartheid” measures after refusing school meals to children of migrants who could not provide formal declarations of assets from their home countries. The policy, which Ceccardi advised on, was backed by Salvini before opposition from M5S forced a climbdown.Other minorities have been targeted. Using a favourite turn of phrase, Salvini has threatened to “bulldoze” a Roma camp in Rome and pledged to conduct a census of the community in Italy as a whole. Last month he threatened to “return with the bulldozer” to San Lorenzo, a leftwing quarter of the capital, following the murder of a 16-year-old girl.“In Rome, as elsewhere in Italy,” said Salvini, “we will have an emergency programme of evictions. We will hurt the drug dealers. We will make sure the rules are respected.” The violence of the language echoed a notorious election campaign speech in which the League leader said Italy needed a “mass cleansing, street by street, district by district”.No one died in the attack and Traini apologised in court for his actions, saying: “While in prison, I have understood that the colour of one’s skin has nothing to do with anything.”But Salvini blamed the shootings on “out-of-control immigration … which leads to social conflict”. That response led the then head of the Italian parliament, Laura Boldrini, to comment: “What happened at Macerata shows that to incite hatred and legitimise fascism, as Salvini does, has real consequences.”As the most powerful figure in the government, says DiMatteo, Salvini is in a position to perfect the role of strongman. “He is presenting himself as the father of all Italians, infantilising them in the process. And he is legitimising and fuelling their anger to a dangerous degree.”Italy was the proud host of the Treaty of Rome in 1957, which created the European Economic Community. Until only a few years ago it remained one of the most europhile countries in the EU. But the nationalist genie is out of the bottle.With alarming speed, Italy appears to be transitioning from the ‘austeritarian’ past embodied by Monti to an authoritarian present presided over by Salvini. “Wherever this goes,” says Baldini, “the technocratic option of 2011 is not available now, given the election result. Italy is hitched to this rollercoaster for better or for worse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acc1415df5d2a3c78c302d4c2624c9de112971ff/0_179_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c025370b813e8d6c4a09bf9cd9d4d0fa","title":"mexico andres manuel lopez obrador president","story":"Leftwinger to be sworn in on wave of hope that he can fix poverty, corruption and crime on behalf of ordinary MexicansMexico’s president-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador will take power on Saturday on a wave of hope that he can transform the country on behalf of the poor and marginalized – and suspicions that he will not be able to fulfill such great expectations.The silver-haired 64-year-old, who counts Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as a close friend, won a historic victory in July, bringing the Mexican left to power after 30 years of dashed expectations.Figures from around the world have been invited to the inauguration, including US vice-president Mike Pence, first daughter Ivanka Trump, Corbyn and – to the disgust of López Obrador’s domestic critics – Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro.The man known as Amlo takes office as international attention focuses on a caravan of Central American migrants camped out at the US-Mexico border – the first foreign policy challenge of his administration.Pundits had warned Amlo’s election would unleash a wave of latent anti-Americanism in response to Donald Trump’s racist provocations – but Mexicans seem more preoccupied with the domestic problems such as rampant corruption, persistent poverty and a militarized drug war that has left 200,000 dead.On 10 December 2006, president Felipe Calderón, launched Mexico’s war on drugs by sending 6,500 troops into his home state of Michoacán, where rival cartels were engaged in tit-for-tat massacres.Calderón declared war eight days after taking power – a move widely seen as an attempt to boost his own legitimacy after a bitterly contested election victory. Within two months, around 20,000 troops were involved in operations across the country.The US has donated at least $1.5bn through the Merida Initiative since 2008, while Mexico has spent at least $54bn on security and defence since 2007. Critics say that this influx of cash has helped create an opaque security industry open to corruption at every level.But the biggest costs have been human: since 2007, around 230,000 people have been murdered and more than 28,000 reported as disappeared. Human rights groups have also detailed a vast rise in human rights abuses by security forces.As the cartels have fractured and ersified, other violent crimes such as kidnapping and extortion have also surged. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by violence.\u0026nbspImproved collaboration between the US and Mexico has resulted in numerous high-profile arrests and drug busts. Officials say 25 of the 37 drug traffickers on Calderón’s most-wanted list have been jailed, extradited to the US or killed, although not all of these actions have been independently corroborated.The biggest victory – and most embarrassing blunder – under Peña Nieto’s leadership was the recapture, escape and another recapture of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, leader of the Sinaloa cartel.While the crackdown and capture of kingpins has won praise from the media and US, it has done little to reduce the violence.Mexico’s decade-long war on drugs would never have been possible without the huge injection of American cash and military cooperation under the Merida Initiative. The funds have continued to flow despite growing evidence of serious human rights violations.\u0026nbsp“We don’t like Trump, but we also understand that he’s a danger for the country – so if you can mollify the danger, so much the better,” said Federico Estévez, political science professor at ITAM, a private university.With Amlo, “it’s about being Mexico-first, not being anti-gringo”, he added.He takes power amid astronomical expectations from ordinary Mexicans.“We need a change, to do what’s never been done before,” said Erik Yniesta, 44, an addictions counsellor.“He took on the system and beat it. He was the only valid option,” said Eleonora Montes, a sales representative in Tijuana. “All our politicians steal. In a country that’s so poor, they come to power as a way to get rich.”Such opinions reflect widespread disgust with the country’s mainstream politicians: outgoing president Enrique Peña Nieto leaves office with historically low approval ratings.Peña Nieto was initially feted by international commentators for structural reforms – Time magazine featured him on a cover emblazoned with the words “Saving Mexico” – but his administration quickly became bogged down in corruption scandals and growing anger over the dismal economy.Meanwhile, the country raced past a series of grim milestones with record numbers of homicides, but the president seemed uninterested in tackling the violence and corruption which beset ordinary Mexicans.“He simply didn’t know how to deal with the problems his government faced,” said Javier Garza, an editor in the northern city of Torreón.Amlo promises clean government and has argued that previously corrupt politicians will fall into line if the president sets a proper example.But last week, he stunned the country by saying he wouldn’t pursue past cases of corruption, preferring instead to turn the page.He further dismayed supporters by unveiling a plans for a new militarized national guard under military command – despite mounting evidence that Mexico’s armed forces have committed widespread human rights abuses in the name of the war on organized crimes.Meanwhile, he has held a string of plebiscites before even taking office – overturning a proposed new airport in Mexico city and rubber-stamping a series of pet projects, including a new refinery in his home state and a “tourist” train to the Mayan ruins of Palenque.All of the proposals were overwhelmingly approved – but on a turnout in single figures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af3bf00ea1d9e3eb6bb3bba4e619a06865a71c2d/0_472_2271_1362/master/2271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5139e6a6b410ee0a1d6011ecf2af785d","title":"macron saudi arabia mbs conversation g20 summit caught on mic","story":"French presidential aide confirms they spoke about Khashoggi murder and Yemen after microphone picks up informal talkThe Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, suspected of ordering the murder of the dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi and accused of war crimes in the Yemen conflict, has told the French president, Emmanuel Macron, “Don’t worry” at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires.The two leaders were having an informal conversation on the sidelines of the summit, standing close together and apparently unaware their conversation was being recorded. The subject of the snatched conversation was not immediately clear but a French presidential aide said afterwards that the Khashoggi murder and the Yemen conflict were the two key topics of the short exchange.According to a  analysis of their only partly audible conversation, Macron replies to the crown prince’s assurances: “I do worry. I am worried … I told you.”“Yes, you told me,” the prince says. “Thank you very much.”“You never listen to me,” Macron says.“No, I listen, of course,” replied Prince Mohammed, smiling broadly after apparently becoming aware of a television camera.“Because I told you. It was more important for you,” Macron says, and gives a tight smile, before turning away from the camera to speak further to the prince.Macron then says something inaudible, to which the Saudi leader says: “It’s OK. I can deal with it.”After another indecipherable segment of conversation, Macron says: “I am a man of my word.”The Élysée Palace said the two leaders had a five-minute exchange on the sidelines of the summit in which Macron conveyed a “very firm” message to the prince over the killing and the need to find a political solution for the situation in Yemen.The Saudi prince’s decision to attend the G20 summit in Buenos Aires represented a calculated risk, as it was unclear whether the other leaders would condemn him. Many of his closest aides and security staff were involved in Khashoggi’s murder on 2 October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and the CIA has reportedly assessed that the prince gave the order for the execution.The results of the 33-year-old Saudi leader’s gambit were mixed at the start of the two-day summit. Macron and the UK’s prime minister, Theresa May, agreed to meet him. May insisted she had strong words to convey about the Khashoggi murder and the need for a full accounting of Riyadh’s alleged involvement.During a group photo marking the start of the summit, the prince stood at the far edge of the group, largely ignored and left alone as soon as it was over. But a few minutes later, Vladimir Putin greeted the Saudi prince warmly, giving him a high five as they sat down together at the large ring-shaped table for the first group session.Putin also came to the Argentinian capital fighting pariah status after an incident in the Azov Sea on Sunday in which Russian vessels rammed a Ukrainian tugboat and opened fire on two small Ukrainian navy cutters it was accompanying.Russian forces seized the vessels and their crew and Moscow’s refusal to return them was the reason Donald Trump offered for his decision to cancel a bilateral meeting with Putin, which had been planned for Friday morning.As Russian actions in the Sea of Azov had been known for days, there was speculation in Washington that the real reason for the change of mind was the court appearance of Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, on Thursday in which he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the extent and duration of negotiations with the Kremlin about a possible Trump hotel in Moscow, continuing up to July 2016, at the height of the presidential election campaign.Trump, whose campaign is being investigated for its alleged links to the Kremlin, had denied any business dealings in Russia.On Friday, Russian media reported that Trump and Putin would meet informally at the fringes of the full G20 summit, but a White House official said no such “pull aside” had been scheduled.There was similar uncertainty over whether Trump would meet the Saudi crown prince, whom the president has supported in the face of US intelligence findings of his alleged culpability in the Khashoggi murder. The administration also suffered a significant rebuke from the Senate, which ignored the urging of top Trump officials and refused to shelve a debate on whether to cut US military support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.The Saudi-owned broadcaster Al Arabiyah reported that the crown prince and Trump had held a “friendly meeting” on the sidelines of the summit, but the White House said the encounter only amounted to an exchange of pleasantries, similar to the US president’s greeting with every other leader.Before arriving in Buenos Aires, Trump had declared himself willing to meet the crown prince, while his national security adviser, John Bolton, ruled it out, saying there was no room in the president’s schedule. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, met his Saudi counterpart, Adel al-Jubeir, separately in a meeting that a statement said was focused on planned Yemen peace talks next week, “as well as the importance of making progress on the investigation into Jamal Khashoggi’s death”.On leaving the meeting, the Saudi foreign minister described it as “very productive”, saying they have discussed “challenges in the region and the bilateral relationship and ways of moving it forward”. Asked if they had also discussed Khashoggi, he did not reply.Trump began the day by attending a signing ceremony for a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, the USMCA, to replace the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). .“Just signed one of the most important, and largest, Trade Deals in US and World History,” Trump announced in a tweet. “The United States, Mexico and Canada worked so well together in crafting this great document. The terrible NAFTA will soon be gone. The USMCA will be fantastic for all!”Experts say the USMCA is a slightly tweaked and updated version of Nafta, which Trump has persistently pilloried. In his own remarks the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, repeatedly referred to the deal as “the new Nafta”, a formulation he must have known would annoy the prickly US president.The leaders began the summit without Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, whose plane had broken down on the way to Argentina and who was making her way to Buenos Aires on commercial flights, leaving May the only female leader at the meeting.As the proceedings began, it was unclear whether the participants would be able to agree on a final statement as the US had objected to some of the draft language on free trade and the need for multilateralism. The statement had not been settled by Friday afternoon, according to diplomats at the summit.Referring to some of the difficulties in finding even the most basic common language, the European council president, Donald Tusk, told journalists: “As this is a difficult moment for international cooperation, I would like to appeal to the leaders to use this summit, including their bilateral and informal exchanges, to seriously discuss real issues such as trade wars, the tragic situation in Syria and Yemen and the Russian aggression in Ukraine.”“I see no reason why the G20 leaders shouldn’t have a meaningful discussion about solving these problems. Especially because all the instruments lie in their hands,” Tusk said. “The only condition is goodwill.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709939.1543164372!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"suspect device the all metal hip replacement that caused untold hardship","story":"The DePuy ASR hip launched in 2004, was promoted as a game changer in orthopaedics, with 3,300 patients receiving the hip in Ireland.  Problems were discovered, resulting in its recall in Ireland in 2010. Video: Bryan O’Brien Report: Colm Keena\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGillian O’Sullivan: ‘He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.’Scandals involving breast implants and all-metal hips prosthetics have raised global concerns and prompted regulatory reform in the European Union. Now the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has conducted a major investigation into the medical device sector.The debacle that is the DePuy metal hip illuminates the ways medical devices are brought to market and the mayhem that can ensue if a product fails to live up to expectations.On a per capita basis, more of the DePuy hips were implanted in Ireland than in any other jurisdiction. In excess of 1,000 Irish patients have issued proceedings against DePuy. Hundreds have already settled.When Gillian O’Sullivan gets up from her chair to fetch some hip X-rays, you can’t but notice that one of her legs is shorter than the other.One of the difficulties with replacing hips is that the artificial implants wear out. As bone and tissue get destroyed when prosthetics are being implanted, replacing worn-out implants with new ones is not a simple matter. For this reason, the practice has been to wait until people are older, and less active, before giving them artificial hips. If you get the timing right, the patient may be dead before the hip implant has failed.But in the early 2000s, hip implant manufacturers started to market new, longer-lasting implants they said were suited to younger, active people.In 2005, when she was 40, Gillian O’Sullivan went to see the highly regarded local orthopaedic surgeon, Tadhg O’Sullivan, in the Waterford Regional Hospital. She was suffering from arthritis.“He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.”Her surgeon was referring to a new metal product from DePuy, a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and a major manufacturer of orthopaedic products. The so-called ASR hip came in two variants. One was a hip resurfacing device, which covered the cup and ball of the hip socket, while the second was a total hip replacement product, which involved replacing the top of the femur with a metal device, which then sat into the metal cup.Both products differed from what was previously on the market in that both traditional hip implants used a metal ball and a polyethylene or plastic cup. The DePuy hip had a ball and cup made out of a hard-wearing cobalt chromium metal alloy.Tadhg O’Sullivan was one of six design surgeons who had worked with DePuy’s engineers to design the new product. It is standard practice for innovative new products to be developed with the assistance of clinicians.At the time he saw Gillian O’Sullivan, the Waterford surgeon was showing surgeons around the world how to implant the new product, and taking part in post-market surveillance of how the product was performing.In October 2005, Gillian O’Sullivan had a DePuy hip replacement device implanted on her left side at the Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny. In May 2006, her second hip was replaced. She was told she now had the “hips of Brian O’Driscoll”.However, her operations were difficult and she experienced pain afterwards.“By Christmas 2006 we knew I was in trouble. I had no energy levels, I was really sick, and you could hear me coming down the stairs. There was a click, click, click, every time I moved.”Her children could hear the grinding of her metal hips.In May 2007, she went back to Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I said, I’m in trouble here. He argued with me. He said I was in better condition than I had been.”She was told that “the god of orthopaedics” had performed her hip operation and that she should wait and see.By this stage O’Sullivan had moved from the Waterford Regional Hospital to the private Whitfield Clinic, also in Waterford. “Between 2007 and 2010, I was in an awful state. I would say to myself, I think I am dying.”Gillian O’Sullivan now believes that during the years 2007 to 2011, metal ions from her hip implants were progressively damaging the flesh and bone of her hip joints.When the DePuy hip was withdrawn from the market in August 2010, Irish patients were advised that their future care would involve the monitoring of the cobalt and chromium levels in their blood.After the withdrawal, Gillian O’Sullivan got a letter for an appointment at the Whitfield and Tadhg O’Sullivan warned her that she would be hearing a lot of public debate about cobalt and chromium ion levels in the blood. He said it was “all bullshit”.“They are trying to frighten everybody.”She went to see Jimmy Sheehan at the Blackrock Clinic again and brought along her blood test results which showed very high metal ion levels. “He said, you need to get those hips out now. They’re poisoning you.”In 2011, the right hip was replaced by O’Sullivan at the Whitfield, and a year later the second hip was also replaced. The operations, which were paid for by DePuy, were difficult, she said, and left her with a left leg that was longer than her right.During her original operations and subsequent operations Gillian O’Sullivan met a number of other patients who were having DePuy hips implanted or replaced by Tadhg O’Sullivan. Among those she met was Kiera Kenneally, who had DePuy hips implanted by Tadhg O’Sullivan in 2005 and 2006, the first when she was just 16 years old.Kenneally, who now lives in Sandyford, Dublin, is originally from Hillview, Waterford, and Gillian O’Sullivan knew her family. Kenneally sued DePuy. Her case was heard over a number of days in the High Court in 2016, but the case was settled with the agreement including a confidentiality clause. However, the transcripts from the sitting days have been seen by The .In August 2005, Kenneally had a resurfacing procedure done by O’Sullivan in Kilcreene. In May of the following year, the second hip was resurfaced.The left hip implant was replaced by O’Sullivan in 2010. During the operation, substantial metal ion damage to her hip tissue was discovered and there was substantial loss of bone.Blood tests taken afterwards showed cobalt and chromium blood levels that were, respectively, 10 and four times above what would be expected, the High Court was told.Kenneally has since been advised she may in time need to have a Girdlestone procedure, which fuses the femur to the hip so that it can no longer bend. She may end up in a wheelchair.The medical records in Kenneally’s case showed that before her procedure, Tadgh O’Sullivan discussed both with her and her mother the concept of metal-on-metal hips, the possibility of failure, and the issue of debris (which in turn leads to the release of ions).Gillian O’Sullivan also sued DePuy. During her High Court action, she says, DePuy “fought me all the way”.She also enlisted Nargol as an expert witness and he told the court that 90-95 per cent of her problems were due to the DePuy implants. DePuy argued that 90-95 per cent of her difficulties were due to her congenital condition.Mr Justice Kevin Cross decided that 90 per cent of O’Sullivan’s difficulties were referable to the DePuy hips, and awarded her €740,000. DePuy said it would appeal and the matter was then settled for €520,000.Unusually for people who made settlements with DePuy, Gillian O’Sullivan did not agree to a “gagging” clause and so is free to discuss her experience.In his judgment in November 2016, Mr Justice Cross said O’Sullivan was an “honest historian” who did not consciously exaggerate, but that her difficulties prior to her hip operations were greater than she recalled.As was the case with the Kenneally trial, Tadgh O’Sullivan was not a party in the O’Sullivan case, was not called by either side, and no one criticised his surgical skills. The judge said he accepted that O’Sullivan’s relationship with her surgeon had broken down some time after the second DePuy implant operation.O’Sullivan would need future revisions and would continue to be severely disabled for the rest of her life, the judge said. “The plaintiff will also be in significant pain, probably for life.”Gillian O’Sullivan says, reflecting on what’s happened to her: “You make the most of your life. I can’t be on a beach. The balance is completely gone, and I would fall over nothing. I get pains and contractions. I was in bed for six weeks after Christmas.”She is a mix of being surprisingly upbeat, while also occasionally displaying a fierce sense of resentment towards Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I live my life. If I’m upright for the day, I’m happy.”The DePuy hip debacle may end up costing DePuy up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages. Other producers of metal hip implants are also being sued.Although figures are not available for the Republic, total damages of up to €80 million may yet be paid to Irish recipients of DePuy hips, with legal costs in addition to that. It is the largest corporate personal injuries episode to ever hit the Irish legal system.Despite the challenges a metal-on-metal product presented, a new all-metal hip resurfacing product, known as the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) system, made by Smith \u0026amp Nephew, came on the market in the late 1990s and began to prove popular.The device was attractive for young, active people with hip problems, and Tadhg O’Sullivan was an early fan. A former GAA player himself, O’Sullivan was known for treating young athletes with joint problemsO’Sullivan told The  that it was because of his extensive use of the Birmingham hip that he was invited to work with DePuy in relation to its new product. At the time “I was probably one of the most experienced hip resurfacing surgeons in the world.”Companies developing new implants often engage surgeons to assist them. Although DePuy engineers put a huge amount of work into designing their new product, this did not including clinical trials, something that was not necessary under EU rules.Simulator tests were used, but critics say the tests did not replicate the repeated stop and start motion that is intrinsic to human joint use, and were restricted to larger model components, the sort used by larger framed people.“It would have been a very good design process if they were designing a washing machine,” says Trinity College Dublin engineering professor David Taylor. “They seem to have forgotten that it was going into a human being.”Taylor, who specialises in materials that are inserted into the body, has acted for a number of people who are suing DePuy. For him, a critical failure made by the DePuy engineers was not testing the proposed product on people prior to going to market.The head of medical device regulation in Ireland, Dr Niall MacAleenan, speaking generally, said clinical testing of medical device products was complicated by the fact that many devices were designed to be inside the body for years if not decades.Assessments as to the suitability of implanted devices involves a “risk benefit” assessment. “There is always risk. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”In January 2004, DePuy got approval from a UK notified body, BSI, to market its two metal hip products throughout the EU. Approval across other, non-EU markets soon followed.For the US market, the company had to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was considered a tougher regulatory authority than the multi-agency structure operating in the EU.English surgeon Tony Nargol was an early enthusiast for the new DePuy product. In September 2003, he travelled to Rome for the product launch, where he met Tadhg O’Sullivan and some of the other design surgeons. He agreed to become involved in a clinical study of the device to be used to seek approval for the product in the United States, and also to become an “opinion leader” for the device in the UK.Between 2004 and 2009, the Newcastle surgeon implanted about 500 of the metal devices, making him one of the highest users of the product in the world.However, by late 2006 a number of his patients were presenting with difficulties. Nargol began to study the performance of the DePuy product in his patients, working with hospital colleague Simon Jameson.Among the matters they began to examine was the role played by the “angle” of implantation of the cup. They also began to notice that it was smaller models of the device, used in smaller framed persons, that appeared to be causing the most difficulties.When he revised the DePuy hip in some of his patients, Nargol noted a “greenish grey” fluid in the hip joint while doing so. This was “tissue necrosis”, he told the courts in Australia in an affidavit in 2013.In early 2007, he asked Ian Newell, DePuy’s regional manager in the Newcastle area, if he knew of other cases involving greenish grey fluid and tissue necrosis. “Mr Newell replied that he was ‘not aware of any’,” Nargol said in his affidavit.The response he got from DePuy caused Nargol to think that the problems he was encountering were caused by his work rather than the product.At a meeting with Newell and others in a hotel in Durham in September 2007, Nargol discussed the apparent link between smaller devices and high ion levels.In response, Newell showed him the data from a DePuy study of 89 patients who had received the hips in the UK, Australia, South Africa and Germany. The study subjected them to regular blood-testing to see if their cobalt and chromium ion levels became elevated.In November 2007, two papers about the DePuy hips were presented at the American Academy of Hip and Knee Surgeons conference in Dallas, Texas, one by Nargol and one by Graham Isaac, the DePuy engineer who led the team that designed the new product. Both flagged problems with the device.Isaac’s paper was entitled Whole Blood Metal Ion Levels after Surface Replacement of the Hip the effect of Component Positioning, and the authors included Isaac, Tadgh O’Sullivan and the other design surgeons, as well as a surgeon from South Africa. The authors reported that 24 months after their procedures, the ion levels for 50 patients (40 male and 10 female) showed three female (30 per cent) and three males (7.5 per cent) had significantly higher ion levels than would be expected.These elevated levels were associated with their devices being implanted at particular angles, the conference was told.DePuy, O’Sullivan and the other authors were saying the negative outcomes were related to how the devices were implanted rather than attributable to any defects in the device.During 2008, Nargol continued to have regular contact with Isaac, Newell and other DePuy representatives. He also began to notice patients with difficulties whose implants had been put in at an angle that was at or near the “safe zone” that he and his colleagues had identified from their research.In time, Nargol came to believe that the product was at fault, not his work as a surgeon. The implants put in at particular angles tended to fail earlier than others, and so created the early impression that the angle was the source of the problem.In August 2008, Nargol stopped using the complete hip replacement product and in early 2009 he stopped using the DePuy resurfacing product also.A colleague, surgeon David Langton, had by this time noticed a new problem with the DePuy implant called “edge-loading”, which contributed to high wear and debris and was, in Langton’s view, the result of the design of the DePuy product.During a meeting with Isaac on March 11th, 2009, at DePuy’s offices in Leeds, Langton and Nargol outlined their latest findings.Nargol said there were problems with the DePuy product even when it was implanted at the recommended angle. There was a “design flaw”, especially with smaller cups.One of the DePuy representatives at the meeting said, “we’re f**ked”, Nargol said in his Australian affidavit. Isaac said the problem was “multifactorial”, with the factors involved including patient weight and activity levels.Requests submitted through DePuy for interviews with Isaac and Newell were declined.In time Nargol became one of the harshest critics globally of the DePuy product. He and Langton became involved in litigation around the world as patients sued DePuy for damages. Nargol, along with Langton, gave evidence in a lot of these cases and the surgeons are party to continuing proceedings in the US where, as designated whistleblowers, they stand to make significant amounts of money if DePuy ends up having to pay out to the US Government for implants sold to public health programmes.The judge did not have to rule on the mala fides issue because of the position adopted by DePuy in the trial, but he rejected the attack on Nargol’s evidence. He said the expert witnesses for both sides had given honest evidence. Nargol would not be interviewed by The  because of the ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions.In 2010, by way of his involvement in litigation, Nargol discovered that other surgeons had expressed concerns during the mid-2000s about the DePuy product, contrary to what he said he had been told by DePuy.The highly regarded Belfast orthopaedic surgeon, David Beverland, told Nargol he had stopped using the DePuy product in early 2007. Requests from The  to Beverland for an interview met with no response.Nargol contacted Beverland in 2010 after being told by a former DePuy employee that the Belfast surgeon had experienced problems with his patients.In his Australian affidavit, Nargol quoted a 2010 email from Beverland to Isaac: “All in all, this ASR problem has to date been the worst problem I have faced in my surgical career. It has been a real nightmare.”Nargol also said that in 2010 he was shown emails from the Dutch surgeon Paul Born to a DePuy executive, dated June 2006, in which he said he’d experienced a significant failure rate with DePuy and would no longer be using the product.Nargol said that on several occasions during 2007 and 2008 he had asked Newell, Isaac and their colleague Magnus Flett if other surgeons were noticing similar problems to him.“Mr Newell, Mr Flett, and Mr Isaac told me on several occasions that ‘no one else has had any problems with the ASR’.”The DePuy metal hip was voluntarily recalled in August 2010 after figures from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed it was performing badly when compared with its peers.The registry collects information on all joint replacement operations so as to measure the performance of the different implants that are on the market.In its most recent annual report, the registry said that for the 992,090 hip replacements monitored since it began collecting data in 2002, some 7.27 per cent have been replaced (or revised, as the medical term goes).The replacement rate would be lower if it were not for metal-on-metal implants which showed a replacement rate of 19-22 per cent. The most successful type of hip replacement, metal-on-polyethylene, had a replacement rate of 4.87 per cent.“Metal-on-metal resurfacings have a revision rate at 14 years of 14.76 per cent and their use, as with all metal-on-metal bearings, is now very limited.”After DePuy withdrew its product from the market, there was extensive discussion as to how it had been approved for sale in the first place.The EU and the United States are the world’s two most important bodies when it comes to the regulation of the medical devices sector. In the EU, there are multiple “notified bodies” each of which can award CE marks to proposed new medical devices, thereby allowing them be marketed across the union.In Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the body that licenses new medical devices, while the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has a role in monitoring the safety of devices that are on the market.The DePuy products were approved by BSI, a UK-notified body. Clinical trials were not required under EU rules, even though the products are recognised as among the higher-risk category of medical devices. Approval by an EU-certified body opened the way to the devices being marketed in other economies, including Australia and South Africa. Many of the world’s poorer nations rely on the developed world for the regulation of medical devices.In the US, the FDA decided that the DePuy hip resurfacing product was a significantly new product and required clinical testing. It allowed the marketing of the total hip replacement product.In 2009, DePuy was told confidentially by the FDA that it would not be granting approval for the hip resurfacing product after reviewing company studies that showed it had failed prematurely in “significant” numbers. In response the multinational quietly withdrew its request for approval.The DePuy hip replacement product was approved for the US market by way of a controversial pathway called “substantial equivalence”.Medical devices can be approved for the market in both the EU and the US if they can be shown to be substantially equivalent to a product already on the market, or if they can be shown to be made of parts that are substantially the same as parts already on the market.The rule applies even if the device or parts already approved have since been withdrawn, even for poor performance reasons.As a study in the New England Journal of Medicine put it in January 2013, approval by the FDA by way of substantial equivalence “does not mean that a new device is safe and effective: it means that the device is deemed no less safe and no less effective than a predicate”.The study looked at how the DePuy hip replacement device came to be approved for implantation in US citizens. It found that the lineage of the device involved 95 different devices or device parts that had operated as predicate devices or parts to which DePuy said its new product was substantially equivalent.The predicate devices included ones that were “discontinued long ago because their risk of revision was so much higher than that of other hip” products, the authors noted.The NSAI was not able to tell The  how many higher risk devices it had approved over the past decade by way of equivalence, or how many had been approved after clinical trials, even though the information was sought as far back as September 3rd last.However, MacAleenan of the HPRA points out that precisely because implanted medical devices designed to last a long time inside the body are hard to subject to pre-market clinical testing, the data that comes from devices that are already on the market is particularly valuable.There is another interesting aspect to the substantial equivalence phenomenon both here and in the US, according to a Newcastle University biomedical engineer, Tom Joyce, who has extensively studied the DePuy debacle“It happens all the time that a product comes onto market via substantial equivalence, meaning that it is supposed to be similar to a product already on the market, but it is then marketed as if it is wildly different,” said Joyce, who has worked with Nargol and Langon on behalf of Irish plaintiffs.The EU is currently introducing a new regime for the certification of medical devices that is in part a response to the DePuy hip and other high-profile failures.Tadhg O’Sullivan told The  that up to the date that the DePuy products were withdrawn, he never had a problem with any of his resurfacing patients.Despite the global controversy over the performance of DePuy hip, there is no mistaking O’Sullivan’s continuing enthusiasm for the product.During a lengthy interview in his consultation rooms in the Whitfield Clinic, O’Sullivan said the DePuy implant was an important innovation for patients with serious hip problems.Asked if in his view there was a design flaw with the DePuy hip resurfacing device, his answer was simple: “Not really. If put in properly, no.”Likewise, he said he did not believe there was a flaw with the ball and cup of the total hip replacement product, though there was a problem with the stem that attached it to the patient’s femur.He believed that DePuy, and J\u0026ampJ, were probably acting on the advice of lawyers when they decided to withdraw the product from the market. The decision, he says, was the equivalent of saying: “Sue the f**k out of us.”And that, he said, is what has happened.DePuy has “pumped an outrageous amount of money into putting this thing right. Unfortunately, the more they pump in, the more our legal profession want. They’re like an insatiable dog.”As well as assisting the DePuy engineers and attending design team meetings over a number of years, O’Sullivan was also the co-inventor of two patents registered in the name of DePuy that were associated with the hip product.Publicly available information in the US indicates that the two US design surgeons who worked with O’Sullivan on the DePuy project, Tom Schmalzried and Thomas Veil, received a number of million dollars each in royalties and other payments from the manufacturer.However, O’Sullivan says his royalty income from DePuy was “relatively small” and that if the time he had spent as a design surgeon travelling to meetings and conferences for DePuy had instead been spent working at the Whitfield Clinic he would have been equally well rewarded.He has earned more from DePuy as a result of the programme it has put in place for patients post the withdrawal of the hip product than he did while working as a design surgeon, he said.The enormous global medical legal battle that has erupted since the product was recalled has led to a great amount of misinformation coming into the public domain, the surgeon said. “We have poor people coming in here thinking they are going to die.” It is “very hard to get at the truth when there is a huge amount of money to be made from suing a company”. he added.O’Sullivan said he had not seen one paper which, read closely, showed heightened cobalt and chromium levels causing medical problems. Yet people were coming to him now, he said, with normal ageing problems such as becoming forgetful, and blaming it on their ion levels.The patient may feel fantastic, and may have no problem with their hips, but he tells them the only way to get their ion levels down is “to take out the generator”. It is their choice.Surgeons want to do what is best for their patients, he said. The DePuy project was about “trying to help people of 30 years of age who needed a hip and not be sending them home and have them not working for the next 20 years.”As matters now stand, most metal hip products have been withdrawn from the market and all major manufacturers are producing a similar ceramic ball and cup product. “They’re all giving you the basic Ford Focus.”The threat of being sued means doctors feel pressurised into doing what is safest in terms of legal exposure, rather than what is most appropriate for their patients.Surgeons know that if they put in a product that has been around for decades, but which fails, they cannot be sued, he said. And manufacturers, if they are going to fear being sued, are deterred from creating new devices.The loser in the end, he says, because of the stifling of innovation, is the patient.A special alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process has been put in place by the Irish courts such is the level of claims that have been lodged against DePuy over its metal hip product.The highest award to date has been €750,000, but the average is in the region of €100,000. If a settlement is not agreed, a claimant can take their case to court.As of July, 540 of the 1,108 sets of proceedings lodged against DePuy had been resolved. Many of the proceedings lodged do not qualify for the ADR.A spokeswoman for DePuy said she would not give a figure for total awards made in Ireland to date.“DePuy has no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products,” she said in a statement to The . “We are committed to the wellbeing of our patients and believe the full history of the ASR system shows we have worked properly and responsibly to improve patients’ lives through innovation.“We will continue to stand by our patients.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3716357.1543613086!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish preparations for no deal brexit intensify","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSenior executives from the main airlines, aircraft leasing and aircraft maintenance companies met Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney to discuss contingencies.Behind the scenes preparations by the Government for a no-deal Brexit have intensified in recent weeks, with detailed planning now under way for the possibility of the UK crashing out of the EU next March.Senior executives from the main airlines, aircraft leasing and aircraft maintenance companies met with Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, Minister for Transport Shane Ross and senior officials on Wednesday to discuss Brexit contingencies and preparations.This meeting preceded a European Commission seminar in Brussels on Thursday, also attended by senior Irish officials, on how air travel would be affected by a no-deal Brexit. Measures to keep aircraft flying in the event of such a development were also discussed. Though Irish Ministers have been warned to stay off the airwaves in the UK in the run-in to the vote in the House of Commons on the UK-EU withdrawal treaty on December 11th, the Irish Embassy in London is providing daily updates to Dublin on the state of play in Westminster. Irish diplomats were pessimistic about Mrs May’s prospects during a weekly video conference which involves officials in Dublin, London and Brussels on Thursday morning, sources said.However, they reported that a series of amendments on which House of Commons speaker John Bercow has said he will allow votes, before the substantive vote on the treaty, could result in the British parliament voting to rule out a hard Brexit.Senior Irish officials were also in Brussels for meetings with the commission on Friday about Brexit and no-deal preparations. Irish officials have also been meeting with French counterparts to discuss possible arrangements for Irish trucks coming through the UK and into the port of Calais, where a special EU lane could be reserved for Irish traffic.Government sources say preparations have intensified in recent weeks amid continuing political uncertainty in London.Senior officials say that there is likely to be a step-change in the Government’s public stance after the vote on December 11th, with more obvious and explicit preparations for a no-deal scenario being put in place. While the Government will continue to plan for what it calls the “central scenario” of an agreed Brexit following a two-year transition period, there will be an acknowledgment if Mrs May is defeated on December 11th that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit will move significantly closer.In particular, there are growing concerns over the potential economic impact of a no-deal Brexit, following a Bank of England report this week which warned of an economic crash worse than the one precipitated by the financial crisis of 2008. Concerns centre on the effect on exporters of a sudden fall in sterling, but there are also concerns in the Department of Finance about the budgetary implications of a damaging Brexit.Mr Coveney said on Friday there is still hope the withdrawal treaty could be passed by the House of Commons, adding that he thought Mrs May “has been underestimated at every step of the Brexit process”. However, privately, senior Government sources say that a more realistic – but still optimistic – scenario is that the deal passes on a second vote after being defeated the first time.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin was critical of the Government’s Brexit preparations, saying it had “failed to show the urgency or activity required to fully prepare for it”.But Mr Martin reiterated his pledge not to bring down the Government “during the critical phase which Brexit is in”. He said: “An election campaign and lengthy government-formation period would have posed a serious risk to our national interest.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Bryan O’Brien Methodist College in Belfast – better known as Methody\u0026nbsp– is an interdenominational, co-ed grammar school located at the bottom of\u0026nbspMalone Road in Belfast, next to Queens University. Founded by the Methodist Church in 1865, it has a long-established academic and sporting pedigree in Northern Irish second-level education and is ranked among the top schools in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.Traditionally a Protestant school, Methody now draws both Protestant unionist and Catholic nationalist students. Past pupils include the\u0026nbspDUP MPs Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley jnr, the Nobel physics laureate Ernest Walton, the former Church of Ireland Primate of All Ireland Robin Eames, the artist Colin Davidson, the Hollywood actor Jamie Dornan and the rugby player Paddy Jackson.Joni Mcilroy, who is 18 and\u0026nbspfrom Newtownards, Co Down, says she is Northern Irish. She grew up in a non-religious household. She wants to study politics in the United States.Jonathan ‘Jonny’ Mearns, an 18-year-old\u0026nbspfrom Dunmurry, is a Protestant unionist and identifies as British. He would like to study politics at Queen’s and eventually set up a new conservative political party.Izaak Carnduff, who is 17 and from Bangor, Co Down, identifies as Irish. He comes from a nationalist background and is non-denominational. He hopes to go to university in England next year.Hala Heenan, who is 17 and from south Belfast, is a Catholic nationalist but is not overtly religious. She identifies as Irish. She hopes to study history at university abroad and to return to live in Belfast.Adam Flanagan, a 17-year-old\u0026nbspfrom south Belfast, is a Protestant unionist and British. He wants to study economics in Britain and to return to Northern Ireland to work in business and, later, possibly politics.Shannon McKeown-Gilmore, also a 17-year-old from south Belfast, is a Catholic nationalist and Irish, though she is not religious. She has applied to study law in England and hopes to become a barrister.Jake Lowry, who is 17 and from east Belfast, is a Protestant unionist and British. He hopes to study politics and international relations in England next year and would like to be a civil servant or diplomat.Six out of the seven students raise their hands.None of the seven students puts up their hand.This group of 17- and 18-year-old students, are all in their final year at Methodist College in Belfast and are thinking seriously about their future education and careers. They sat down with The  to discuss Brexit and what it means for them and Northern Ireland.The discussion takes place as the draft orce deal emerges and stirs isions in Northern Ireland, Britain and beyond. The political consequences of a no-deal, disorderly Brexit are huge five students, including one unionist, believe Brexit could result in a united Ireland in their lifetimes.Just two of the students have Irish passports but some of the others, and their family members, are applying because of the potential restrictions on travel after the UK quits the EU in March 2019.Even the only student who supports Brexit within the group, Jonny Mearns, a Protestant unionist, says he might consider an Irish passport if it became very difficult to travel.For these seven students at Methody, Brexit has reopened a complex debate about nationality and identity politics that the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement – negotiated two or three years before they were born – attempted to settle.Jonny\u0026nbspThe money the UK puts into the EU could be spent elsewhere, particularly education. Britain is much better off using that money and trading with the EU or the rest of the world on its own terms.Joni\u0026nbspIt is kind of a regression of ideas to combat globalisation, which I think is impossible anyway. I am not really sure what it is achieving. The main things at the beginning were immigration, sovereignty I am not really sure how we are going to gain those things through Brexit.Izaak\u0026nbspIt is breaking up different people, different countries and it will make it a lot harder for students and people early in their lives to get as many opportunities as they do right now.Jake\u0026nbspAs always in Northern Ireland, identity is a huge issue and you could almost say that Brexit has created an identity crisis. There are nationalists within Northern Ireland who feel that they are being drawn away from their Irish identity and the uncertainty over a hard or soft border, or indeed for unionists, if there is going to be a border down the Irish Sea. Young people within Northern Ireland still remain very close to their identities and all this is being thrown into uncertainty by Brexit.Shannon\u0026nbspI don’t think it will be a deal that everybody wants or agrees with. It’ll be a very middle-ground deal trying to please as many people as possible and ultimately will do the complete opposite.Jake\u0026nbspI live in a predominantly unionist area and in fact the post office ran out of Irish passport application forms within days of the Brexit vote, so there is a real appetite because of the uncertainty.Joni\u0026nbspOur Irish passport forms are in the post. I have always wanted to travel loads so it is pretty crucial that you are not held up in loads of different queues. It was a bit of a no-brainer really.Jonny\u0026nbspThere are a lot of unionists taking up that opportunity but I just think the border question in terms of travelling from France to Britain, having control over our own border, is more important to me than being able to walk through a line at the airport.Adam\u0026nbspThe rulebook of identity in Northern Ireland is almost being torn up by Brexit. There were people who five years ago would have thought it unthinkable to get an Irish passport but they think it now just makes sense. As a Northern Irish unionist, I think that’s what makes Brexit most frightening. If we continue barrelling down this uncertain path towards Brexit, it genuinely calls into question unionism in Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland’s very existence ultimately as well.Hala\u0026nbspIt is a worry for my family because we have a house just across the Border. Are we going to have to bring our passports or other ludicrous questions like that? It is usually a quick 45-minute trip down the road. When travelling in the car, there is a little pole with a little red stick on it. That’s how you know you have crossed the Border.My mum and dad recount the tales of when you used to have to stop and open the boot of the car and there would be army checks. Now there is such an ease of travel. It instils quite a big fear inside me that there is a very small possibility that that might come back.Jonny\u0026nbspTo a certain extent. From Northern Ireland’s perspective, we worry about it a lot but we fail to realise that the majority of our trade is with the rest of the United Kingdom. We also fail to realise that the Republic relies on the United Kingdom more than we rely on the Republic of Ireland.Adam\u0026nbspAny hard border or any hardening of the border, even whether it avoids a totally hard border, is certainly dangerous in that it could risk a return to violence. Whether that would be the case, no-one can foresee that but I think the risk of that isn’t a price worth paying.Shannon\u0026nbspThe DUP – because of their own personal interest, they were obviously a pro-Brexit party – are not recognising that the people of Northern Ireland voted to remain.Jake\u0026nbspThe DUP are a Eurosceptic party. They campaigned for Brexit and Sinn Féin unfortunately don’t take up their seats so how can they advocate for the people of Northern Ireland if they refuse to go to Westminster. It is the issue of symbolism. Sometimes you have to put pragmatism before symbolism.Izaak\u0026nbspIf a “no deal” Brexit was to occur due to chaos from an event such as the DUP pulling the rug out from under Theresa May’s government, then I could potentially see a fracturing of the union that would cause Northern Ireland to splinter off from the UK.Jonny\u0026nbspDespite Northern Ireland voting Remain, it is highly unlikely that many of those who voted Remain but identity as British would be willing to sacrifice the union for the sake of remaining in the EU.Joni\u0026nbspIt seems that unionists in the North are too adamant in their support of the union to concede, and southern nationalists don’t feel strongly enough for Northern Ireland to leave the union at this moment in time. Yet the uncertainty created by Brexit and the changes in Northern Ireland suggest that the prospect is not as far-fetched as it once was.Jonny\u0026nbspBrexit could perhaps result in a united Ireland, but it is improbable. It would have to take Brexit to be a catastrophe before even thinking about this, which I do not for one moment believe will be the case.Jake\u0026nbspA no-deal Brexit would expedite any potential unification of Ireland. Regardless of the actualities of such a scenario, the symbolic significance of a hard border could galvanise moderate voters and pro-EU unionists to turn to Irish nationalism as their solution to a no-deal scenario. Of course, that wouldn’t be a sudden change in thinking but something that would perhaps develop over the decades to come.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: PA Britain’s Universities and Science Minister Sam Gyimah on Saturday became the latest minister to quit the government over prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan, has dismissed her agreement with Brussels as a “deal in name only”. Mr Gyimah said Britain was giving up “our voice, our veto and our vote” in Europe and would get “hammered” in the next stage of the talks on future relations with the EU. He urged the prime minister not to rule out a second referendum if - as many at Westminster expect - she is defeated in the crucial Commons vote on the Withdrawal Agreement on December 11th. Senior ministers continued to argue that while the agreement was not perfect, it was the best that could be achieved. However, with scores of Tory MPs now publicly opposed to the deal, Mr Gyimah’s departure highlights the scale of the task facing Mrs May if she is to avoid a potentially crippling defeat in the Commons.He is the seventh minister and ministerial aide to resign from the government since Mrs May unveiled the draft Withdrawal Agreement less than three weeks ago. Like Jo Johnson, who quit as transport minister, Mr Gyimah backed Remain in the referendum, underlining the fact that opposition to the deal comes from both the Leave and Remain wings of the party. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Mr Gyimah said: “Looking at the deal in detail, we don’t actually have deal.“ We have a deal in name only. We have given up our voice, our veto and our vote. Our interests will be hammered because we will have no leverage. “My worry is the British public will be sleepwalking into a situation where we will wake up and find out that we are no longer equal partners with the countries in Europe. “We are pure supplicants and rule takers. The democratic deficit and the loss of sovereignty that will result in that situation is one the British public, rightly, will never accept.” After Mrs May, in Argentina for the G20 summit, announced she was finally giving up on efforts to secure access to the EU’s Galileo satellite navigation system, Mr Gyimah said the EU’s uncompromising stance foreshadowed the way it would approach the rest of the negotiations. “What has happened with Galileo is a foretaste of the brutal negotiations we will go through that will weaken our national interest, make us poorer, less secure,” he said. He said that if parliament does vote down the deal, Mrs May’s only realistic option may be to put the decision to the country in a second referendum, even though he acknowledged Leave could win again. “There is a blocking minority in the House of Commons for almost every possible option which means that letting the people decide, now that we know more, might be the most sensible path for both Leavers and Remainers,” he said. “The prime minister has already taken one step in that direction by appealing to the country to put pressure on MPs to vote for her deal.“If you are going to appeal to the country to put pressure on MPs to vote for a deal then by all means you can give the decision to the country in terms of which direction we go in. “If we want to avoid to avoid chaos and we want to make sure we are dealing with a decision that is irreversible I would rather go down that path than a go down a path that would cripple our interests for generations to come.” Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said that as MPs and ministers decided which way to vote, they would have to compare the deal with the “realistically available alternatives”. “All of my colleagues are going to have to make their own judgment about what they think about this deal,” he told the 4 Today programme.- David Davis, Brexit secretary: Mr Davis left his role on July 8th, two days after the Chequers plan was agreed. In his resignation letter, he said the role should be filled by someone who was an “enthusiastic believer in your approach, and not merely a reluctant conscript”.Key quote: “The general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one.”- Steve Baker, Brexit minister: Mr Baker followed Mr Davis a day later in resigning over Government strategy on Brexit.Key quote: “I cannot support this policy with the sincerity and resolve which will be necessary.”Mr Johnson became the third departure in two days, saying the Chequers agreement was leaving the UK was heading towards “the status of colony” and the Brexit dream “was dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt”.Key quote: “As I said then, the Government now has a song to sing. The trouble is that I have practised the words over the weekend and find that they stick in the throat.”- Chris Green, parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to the transport secretary:Mr Green also left following the Chequers deal on July 8, saying he feared Mrs May’s proposals would mean “we would not really leave the EU”.Key quote: “I recognise that delivering Brexit is challenging, however I had hoped at tonight’s meeting that there would be some certainty that my fears were unfounded but, instead, they have been confirmed.”- Conor Burns, PPS to the foreign secretary: Mr Burns followed Mr Johnson out the door on July 9th, saying he wanted “to see the referendum result respected”.Key quote: “I’ve decided it’s time to have greater freedom.”- Robert Courts, PPS to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office: David Cameron’s replacement in the Witney constituency left his role on July 15 over Chequers, saying that he could not tell people in his constituency that he supported the proposals in their current form.Key quote: “I had to think who I wanted to see in the mirror for the rest of my life.”- Ben Bradley, Conservative party vice-chairman: The Mansfield MP also left over Chequers on July 10, saying he owed it to his constituents to “raise concerns and speak freely” over the policy.Key quote: “If we do not deliver Brexit in spirit as well as in name, then we are handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to Number 10.”- Maria Caulfield, Conservative party vice-chairman: Mrs Caulfield also left on July 10, saying Chequers “will be bad for our country and bad for the party”.Key quote: “I cannot support the direction of travel in the Brexit negotiations which, in my view, do not fully embrace the opportunities that Brexit can provide.”- Scott Mann, PPS to the Treasury: Mr Mann, MP for North Cornwall, left his role on July 16 as he felt aspects of the Brexit white paper would put him in “direct conflict” with views of his constituents.Key quote: “I am not prepared to compromise their wishes to deliver a watered-down Brexit.”- Guto Bebb, defence minister: Mr Bebb voted against the Government on changes to customs legislation rlating to Brexit, effectively quitting his frontbench role on July 16th.Key quote: “I felt duty bound to try and vote to highlight the fact that the Conservative Party should be led by the prime minister not by the leadership of the ERG (European Research Group) group.”- Jo Johnson, transport minister: The brother of Boris became the second Johnson to leave when he resigned on November 9 to vote against the Brexit deal, saying the choice being offered to the British people was “no choice at all”.Key quote: “To present the nation with a choice between two deeply unattractive outcomes, vassalage and chaos, is a failure of British statecraft on a scale unseen since the Suez crisis.”- Dominic Raab, Brexit secretary: Mr Raab left his role on November 15th following the publication of the draft Withdrawal Agreement citing a number of concerns, saying the backstop arrangement to prevent a border with Northern Ireland was “a very real threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom”.Key quote: “Ultimately, you deserve a Brexit Secretary who can make the case for the deal you are pursuing with conviction. I am only sorry, in good conscience, that I cannot.”- Esther McVey, work and pensions secretary: Mrs McVey followed Mr Raab’s resignation, saying it was “obvious” Mrs May’s plans failed to “honour the result” of the referendum.Key quote: “We have gone from no deal is better than a bad deal, to any deal is better than no deal. I cannot defend this, and I cannot vote for this deal.”- Suella Braverman, Brexit minister: Ms Braverman left her role - which she called a “dream job” - over the Withdrawal Agreement, saying she had concerns about the backstop.Key quote: “I have reached a point where I feel that these concessions do not respect the will of the people — the people who put us here and whom we humbly serve. We must not let them down.”- Shailesh Vara, Northern Ireland minister: Mr Vara said the result of the referendum was “decisive” and that the Government “must deliver”, and that he could not support the Withdrawal Agreement.Key quote: “It leaves the UK in a half-way house with no time limit on when we will finally be a sovereign nation.”Mr Chishti cited the Withdrawal Agreement and a “lack of leadership” on the Asia Bibi case as reasons for leaving.Key quote: “The UK in effect will be part of a system where it will be a rule taker without any say on the rules.”- Ranil Jayawardena, PPS at Ministry of Justice:Mr Jayawardena said the draft Withdrawal Agreement would not allow the country to “take back control” of laws, adding: “I entered public service not to be defined by the European question, but to deliver for my constituents and for our country.”Key quote: “I cannot agree, in the cold light of day, that the deal in front of us today is right for our country. It does not deliver a good and fair Brexit.”- Anne-Marie Trevelyan, PPS to Department of Education: The Berwick-upon-Tweed MP said she had struggled “for months” to continue to support Mrs May on Brexit as she “battled through” negotiations but that she could not back the Withdrawal Agreement.Key quote: “I believe we must protect the Brexit mandate by trying to secure a deal which understands the spirit of the referendum.”Mr Gyimah said he could not support Mrs May as he felt the deal would leave Britain “poorer, less secure and weaker in the pursuit of our national interests”, thus leaving his role on November 30.Key quote: “It has become increasingly clear to me that the proposed deal is not in the British national interest, and that to vote for this deal is to set ourselves up for failure. We will be losing, not taking control of our national destiny.” - PA Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

The country has been launching intense crackdowns on pornographic and adult websites, to broad criticism.The pre-emptive order – which was given before the film was actually released, let alone made available online – is thought to be one of the most wide-ranging ever to be granted.As well as the wide breadth of the number of sites being covered by it, it is notable in that many of the sites covered had not actually started offering the film.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

On a weekday, when thousands of commuters were trying to get to work, college and school let alone the other, vast number of folk who thought they they would see the railway as their most convenient form of travel.Because it was in the North, the stoppage raised barely a glimmer of interest in the South. If it had happened in Kent or Surrey, to trains into London Bridge or Waterloo, all hell would have broken loose. Instead, it was just another day of misery, to go with the other numerous days lost, including when they changed the timetable, and the services across the North could not cope.Meanwhile, the Government is pressing ahead with a £56bn plan to develop HS2. Will the new high-speed link between London and the North-West change any of this? Will it improve things? Not at all. Will it make a difference that justifies such vast expenditure? Hardly. Is it a grotesque example of ministerial machismo, of gesture politics, of a total inability to see the wood for the trees? You bet it is.Archaeologists begin examining 10,000 years of history along HS2 routeNow we know HS2 really is a flawed projectHS2 requires extra £43bn \u0027for people to make the most of it\u0027The trains I’m talking about, the ones that were cancelled, were mostly on the branch lines, on the routes that people use day in, day out - not the West Coast Line, which already has a fast, comfortable service. In my lifetime, since growing up in Cumbria, and travelling to and from London to visit family, journey times have plummeted. On the main, trunk route - not on the secondary ones. This is where the problem lies, where the service is creaking.Cutting several minutes off the London to Manchester service does not matter a h’apporth. What would boost the experience immeasurably there would be to ensure that wifi works all the way, that a mobile signal is not lost. But that, too, is not what HS2 is about.Already, there is talk by those on the inside that the projected costs are soaring. The “main works civil contracts” on the London to Birmingham section, reports The Sunday Times, are “several billion pounds” over the official budget of £6.6bn. That’s before any earth is turned, and all manner of unseen, below ground problems are discovered.Conscious of a final bill that could spiral out of control, and being seen to get a grip, ministers are demanding that instead of sanctioning extra expenditure, costs are being renegotiated, to stick to the budgeted figure. This, in turn, has led to delays, as more design and development is required, and specifications redrawn. Again, the word is that the vast project - the country’s biggest and most demanding infrastructure scheme - is likely to be more than a year behind schedule.That\u0027s how fast HS2\u0026nbspservices will travel at when the project is completedPart of the issue here is that mooted figures are proving inaccurate, the result, apparently of an insistence that the new railway meets a deadline for the beginning of services, of 2026.The thinking behind this demand, that Britain is sick and tired of major capital constructions that seem to take forever to reach fulfilment (runway expansion of Heathrow was first raised exactly 50 years ago) is laudable. But put that together with a scheme that is huge and complex, and it can become a recipe for chaos. And that’s without HS2 being unnecessary in the first place.This is what ministers should realise: that £56bn buys you an awful lot of terribly needed enhancements, for instance to existing country and suburban services, and to digitalisation.There is a subtext, of course, to HS2 - one that is hardly ever raised, let alone publicly admitted. And it is that the 250mph railway has another purpose, beyond rushing passengers from London to Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. It is that the faster railway makes commuting from Birmingham in particular all that more manageable. House prices in the West Midlands are so much cheaper than in the South-East. Public sector workers in essential occupations, in sectors like the NHS and education, will be able to afford to commute from Brum. HS2, you see, is aimed in part at alleviating London’s growing housing crisis. Which makes it a very expensive solution indeed.When confronted with the news of the overruns and delay, the Department for Transport said it would not comment on speculation. “Our priority is to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.”Yes, but does the overall project seriously provide value for money?Ministers have the ability to stop it in its tracks, to ert the investment elsewhere. Of course, that would involve a loss of pride. There would be some dismay in the North, but not as much as might be expected - particularly if the money was spent on other local, much-needed advancements. Perhaps they should test attitudes towards the new service before it\u0027s too late.For there are warning lights flashing all over this. An awful lot of cash is being committed to something for which there is little demand. Getting from A to B may become quicker, but B to C will be just as slow –\u0026nbspand it’s the B to C that is used by so many people every day, that ceased to operate last week and will do so again, even with HS2.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Regulated fares, meanwhile,\u0026nbspare linked to\u0026nbspretail price index\u0026nbspinflation and will rise by 3.2 per cent, as has previously been announced.Regardless of whether they buy regulated or unregulated tickets, the lot of users is not a happy one. They pay through the nose for\u0026nbspa shabby service prone to widespread disruption.\u0026nbspThese trains are affected by the Northern Rail strike this SaturdayA wake up call for rail operators? Commuters now have an ombudsmanThe near meltdown that followed the introduction of new timetables earlier this year brought\u0026nbsppublicity to the problem. But just as serious is the constant low-level pain inflicted upon passengers. No wonder the announcement left them, and their representatives, spitting tacks.\u0026nbspThe backdrop to this is the government’s policy of having taxpayers spend less subsidising the railways, with the\u0026nbspburden being shifted on to the fare-paying public. \u0026nbspAt first blush, that would seem like a credible plan, and even more so when you look at the numbers.\u0026nbspAccording to Full Fact, the fact checking charity, the railways have received subsidies averaging about £5bn a year over the last five years.\u0026nbspBut that’s just the start of it when it comes to public money. In 2016-17 about £15bn was spent in total, partly due to the way Network Rail, which owns and operates the tracks and infrastructure, is funded.\u0026nbspWanda Wyporska\u0026nbspof the Equality Trust\u0026nbspmade the point in  last year that this spending is weighted disproportionately towards London and the southeast, and so favours well-to-do commuters. She argued that the government should focus\u0026nbspon poorer areas\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsptransport used by the less well-off, such as buses and trams. She made a good point.\u0026nbspHowever, I would argue that one needs to look at rail in the context of an integrated transport policy that serves the needs of the nation, and its economy, as a whole.\u0026nbspRail, which has seen a sharp increase in passenger numbers and requires investment to cope with them, plays an important role in keeping people off Britain’s congested, polluting roads. Through that lens, the money is\u0026nbspwell spent.None of this changes the fact that the private rail operators have done a rotten job. Given what they’ve experienced, and what they pay for it, passengers’ outrage is entirely justified.\u0026nbspAt times like this, rail companies are fond of pointing out that 98p out of every £1 in fares goes into running the railways and that the extra money is needed to keep the show on the road.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

There is no limit on how many times the offer can be redeemed it is valid for use once per participating shop.Small retailers in the UK could certainly do with a boost as the high street reaches the end of one of its toughest years in memory, with little sign of any easing of\u0026nbspextremely tough trading conditions.Third of small firms think pound will fall sharply after Brexit dayThis is what Facebook is doing for small businesses in the UKSmall business body calls on Hammond to address late payment ‘crisis’Shop closures jumped 17 per cent to 24,205 in the first half of the year according to the Local Data Company.The number of pubs fell 6.5 per cent in six months as people increasingly choose to buy alcohol from a supermarket and drink at home. Newsagents and clothes shops have also seen large numbers of closures thanks to falling print media sales and competition from online rivals.But research from GlobalData points to some green shoots of recovery breaking through as high streets are reshaped.It found growth in independent operators offering entertainment services like cinemas and escape rooms, hair and beauty, and health and fitness.The findings confirmed that for almost two-thirds of shoppers the desire is for experiences and opportunities\u0026nbspto buy things that can’t be easily sourced online.Maureen Hinton, retail research director at GlobalData, said it was encouraging to see that town centres were evolving to keep up with changing shopping habits.“The growth of online has also made the high street’s role as a service-led\u0026nbspsocial space increasingly important, encouraging the rise of hybrid businesses, with shops, gyms and cinemas now often boasting their own bars, coffee shops and restaurants.“Meanwhile, new categories of business continue to emerge, such as “experience bars”, which combine a night out\u0026nbspwith a complete entertainment experience, centred on an activity\u0026nbspsuch as darts, mini golf or table tennis.\u0026nbsp“There is no doubt that the high street is in a period of unprecedented change, but the rise of new businesses such as these\u0026nbspdemonstrates that this is as much an opportunity as a challenge.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Across England, more than 1.9 million new dwellings have been built in the last decade.But when it comes to prices the market is likely remain “stuck in low gear” with overall growth dragged down by London and the southeast, said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY Item Club.“Consequently, we expect overall house price gains across the UK over 2019 will be limited to around 2 per cent,” he added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That should allow people to share more personal moments with a smaller group, Instagram said.Instagram Stories has become the place to express yourself and share everyday moments, but our community has grown — sometimes what you want to share isn\u0027t for everyone, the company wrote in its announcement blog post.Instagram’s latest feature aims to tackle social media addictionInstagram had always intended for stories to be a more personal way of sharing information on the site. Not only do they disappear 24 hours after they are posted, users can see everyone who has watched them.Adding people to the list of close friends is simple: go to your profile and click on the Close Friends option in the side menu and add people. Then when you share a new story, you\u0027ll have the option of sharing only with the people in that list.Only you can see your own close friends list, people will not know from the app if they are not in it, and there is no way for people to ask to be added.\u0026nbspIf you are chosen as someone\u0027s close friend, you will see a green ring badge when you\u0027re viewing their stories, and a green ring around their profile photo in the list of stories.Close friends will be rolling out globally today on both iOS and Android, the company said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

William Cook catches\u0026nbspup with him in his Bristol studioClick to followThe IndependentKnees up at Yates\u0027s Wine Lodge, in Ashton-Under-Lyne: these lodges had a dismal reputation, seemingly designed for taking the quickest route to oblivionAt Manchester Art Gallery, in the beating heart of England’s most happening city (sorry, London – you’ve had your turn), Martin Parr is showing a gaggle of reporters around his latest exhibition. It’s called Return to Manchester, and the title is telling. Parr is a southern softy, born and raised in Surrey, but it was as a photography student at Manchester Polytechnic in the early 1970s that he found his creative focus. His first exhibition, back in 1971, was just down the road, in a corridor at Kendal Milne department store. Half a century later he’s back in the metropolis that made him, to open a one man show of Mancunian photos, then and now.It’s an exhibition of two halves: black and white photographs of the rundown Manchester of the 1970s colour photos of the dynamic Manchester of today. Wry and playful, yet imbued with a deep, unspoken sense of melancholy, it’s a profound and powerful evocation of the way that Manchester – and Martin Parr – has changed. “I had a fantastic time in Manchester,”\u0026nbsphe says, and his affection for the city – then and now – is evident in these photos.Picture of heart-shaped cancer cells wins science photography prizeThe earliest photographs in the show were taken while he was still at college, and the images that encapsulate\u0026nbspthe Manchester of the early 1970s are the June Street photos he took with his friend and fellow student, Daniel Meadows. They’d gone in search of Coronation Street, but the street which inspired the Salford soap opera had already been demolished. However, a few scenes had been shot on June Street, an adjacent street which had survived.Instead of photographing the drab exteriors of these terraced houses, they ventured within. Their portraits of the people they found inside exude the poise and dignity of Old Masters, which is ironic, for Parr has often been accused of being a photographer who takes the piss. “Unless there’s some vulnerability there, I don’t think you’re going to get good photographs,” he once said. There’s vulnerability here aplenty, and that’s what makes these portraits so appealing.June Street was one of several photographic projects which Parr undertook, entirely of his own accord, during his student days in Manchester. A series of photos inside Prestwich Mental Hospital captured the bleak ambience of that institution, but it was his Love Cubes series (which doubled as a board game) that epitomised his sense of fun. Parr photographed couples on the streets of Manchester, together and then separately. The idea of the game is to try and work out who’s going out with whom.Half a lifetime later these student projects still feel fresh and vital, but Parr’s course was a vocational training for a career as a commercial photographer, and so his superiors weren’t impressed. He could have been chucked out if it hadn’t been for Alan Murgatroyd, the one tutor who fought his corner. Happily, after all these years, Murgatroyd is still with us, and he appeared as the guest of honour\u0026nbspto open Parr’s new show.For this show Parr has returned to Manchester to shoot a new set of photographs, and the city of today feels a world away from the city of his student days. It’s multicultural and, above all, colourful –\u0026nbspfrom Media City to the Eithad, from mosques to yoga classes, from royal wedding street parties to Gay Pride. It was unimaginable, 30 or 40 years ago, that Pride would have such a big impact in a city like Manchester,\u0026nbsphe says. From pies at Bury market to gluten-free brownies in the Northern Quarter, like an anthropologist Parr finds signs of change amid the ephemeral and the mundane.Created with Sketch.The best of The

I doubt it. But the rest of Britain has changed almost as much, and Parr has chronicled that change with more wit and insight than any other artist I know. What makes his vision so acute? To try and find out, I travelled to Bristol, where he’s lived since 1987, to meet this elusive and enigmatic man who excels at examining the minutiae of our daily lives.We meet at his studio, on an industrial estate on the scruffy side of Bristol. His studio is tidy and businesslike (not for him the chaotic squalor of the tortured, tormented artist). His appearance is similarly anodyne, almost anonymous – nondescript leisurewear, neither smart nor scruffy. His manner is friendly but noncommittal – warm smile, wary eyes. He speaks quietly, clearly, lucidly. His voice is classless, rootless. He chooses his words with care.“I was fully aware that Manchester had changed enormously in the 35 years since I lived there,”\u0026nbsphe says. “There are now two Manchesters – there’s the traditional one and the gentrified one, so I went to both.”He’s broadly enthusiastic about the gentrification of the city, but he can see the downside too. “Gentrification can be a mixed blessing. It can tend to kill off the sense of community that was there before – richer, younger people move in – but in the end I think without it these places would suffer even more.”As befits a born observer, accustomed to travelling incognito, he’s used to blending into the background. With his pleasant but forgettable face, his neat grey hair and his bland chainstore clothes, he’d make a good private detective. He looks more like a middle ranking civil servant than a famous photographer - which is fitting, for that was his father’s job (though his passion was ornithology). Martin used to accompany him on his birdwatching trips - though Martin always used to watch the birdwatchers, not the birds.He was born in 1952 in Epsom, the buckle in the commuter belt. His parents were Methodists (“I went to Sunday School and argued with the teachers”), comfortably off, in a humdrum way, and reasonably contented. He has one sibling, a sister, seven years younger, which made him almost an only child. It sounds like a barren beginning for a creative artist, but the absence of high drama compelled him to look more closely, more keenly, at the world around him. “The advantage of coming from suburban Surrey is that everywhere else looks more interesting.”\u0026nbspHe was a meticulous collector, and a quintessential trainspotter. He still collects all sorts of trash-aesthetic bric-a-brac today.His main inspiration was his paternal grandfather, George Parr, a lay preacher and a keen amateur photographer, who lived in Calverley, in West Yorkshire. George taught him the rudiments of photography. For Martin, it was love at first sight. “There was never any doubt. As soon as I saw it, I thought ‘That’s the medium for me – that’s what I want to be.’”\u0026nbspMartin’s summer holidays in Calverley were among his happiest childhood memories. ‘I’ve always had a soft spot for Yorkshire – my father’s from Yorkshire, I’ve got Yorkshire in my blood.’ His first photographic project was a study of Harry Ramsden’s, the celebrated Yorkshire fish and chip shop. It was here that his passion for photography – and the north of England – began.Martin passed his 11-plus and went to Surbiton Grammar School, but compared with his Yorkshire apprenticeship school was distinctly uninspiring. He was a mediocre student and his teachers were underwhelmed. His school report makes interesting (and, in retrospect, amusing) reading. ‘He has considerable flair for photography and a certain amount of ability in the art field, but there seems to be little chance of realising his potential if his attitude to his general work continues to be so poor,’ wrote his form tutor. “Very little work achieved – very lackadaisical,”\u0026nbspconcurred his art master.It was only when he went to Manchester that he really spread his wings. In Manchester he encountered a sense of community more akin to the one he’d found in Calverley. “Coming from suburban Surrey, I was very taken with that – the friendliness of people, and how open they were.”He lived in Moss Side, which was thrilling. When they started demolishing Moss Side we used to go round and pick the stuff out of the old houses and photograph it – we had a great time. Photography was his calling. Despite being on a course which didn’t suit him, making work for which there was no real outlet, he never doubted his abilities. I knew what I wanted to do and why, and I just got on with it. I had total self-belief.In Manchester he met Susie Mitchell, an English student from the Home Counties who collaborated with him on various projects and subsequently became his wife. In the 1970s, Manchester was an exciting place to live, like a foreign country after the outer London suburbs, she wrote, in her eloquent introduction to The Non-conformists, his haunting book of photos of Yorkshire chapel life. Swathes of condemned terraced housing, monstrous Victorian public buildings, acres of wasteland awaiting redevelopment, grimy parks and odiferous curry houses…\u0026nbspFor Martin it was paradise.After graduating from Manchester they moved to Hebden Bridge, where they formed close relationships with some of the subjects of The Non-conformists (Susie interviewed them Martin photographed them). This intimacy resulted in some remarkable photos, but the relationship ended rather unhappily when some of their subjects realised, belatedly, that they were only photographic subjects (rather than soulmates) after all.I wasn’t a believer,\u0026nbspsays Parr. I respected their religion and I enjoyed partaking in it and photographing it.\u0026nbspHowever, he was essentially an atheist. From then on Martin kept his distance and his work became more detached. You’re never part of what you photograph,\u0026nbsphe says. You’re always an outsider.Susie became a speech therapist, a job that took her to Ireland and then to Merseyside. Martin went with her and on Merseyside he found the subject that made his name. His stark photos of New Brighton (a rundown seaside resort near Liverpool) were revolutionary. For one thing, they were in colour (a medium still shunned by so-called “serious”\u0026nbspphotographers) but above all it was his stark treatment of these Liverpudlian daytrippers which broke new ground.Parr showed New Brighton in all its gory glory – the fractious toddlers, the bored parents, the litter, the fast food... There was nothing falsified about it, but there was nothing prettified about it either, and for middle class audiences used to quaint depictions of the worthy poor, it was a rude awakening. This is a clammy, claustrophobic nightmare world where people lie knee deep in chip papers, swim in polluted black pools and stare at a bleak horizon of urban dereliction,\u0026nbspwrote Robert Morris in the British Journal of Photography. Parr called his series The Last Resort.The show was well received in Liverpool. Ironically, it was when it went to London that the reaction became more critical. Our historic working class, normally dealt with generously by documentary photographers, becomes a sitting duck for a more sophisticated audience,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspwrote David Lee\u0026nbspin Art Review. They appear fat, simple, styleless, tediously conformist and unable to assert any inidual identity. They wear cheap flashy clothes and in true conservative fashion are resigned to their meagre lot. Only babies and children survive ridicule, and it is their inclusion in many pictures which gives Parr’s acerbic vision of hopelessness its poetic touch.With the hindsight of history, this seems rather unfair. Parr’s vision is acerbic but he never ridicules his subjects. On the contrary, his day-trippers actually seem rather admirable, striving to give their children a nice day out in the face of overwhelming odds. Merseyside was a pretty hopeless place in 1986. Like all good photographers, Parr was simply shooting what he saw.I don’t think I’m out there to take the piss, particularly. There has to be a sense of mischief, because that’s part of the British make-up and identity, but the mischief is applied equally to everything and anybody, because life is weird. People are strange, and people are entertaining. I do like people –\u0026nbspI love what they all get up to.’Most of the things he photographs are things he does himself.‘Portrait of Britain’ photo competition highlights ersity of nationFive tips for underwater filming and photographyStanley Kubrick\u0027s unseen photography reveals early talent of directorHe’s impervious to criticism of his work. I realised pretty early on that that controversial aspect to what I do never does you any harm,\u0026nbsphe says. I’m very democratic when it comes to classes – I put it up all classes.\u0026nbspHe followed up The Last Resort with several projects about the bourgeoisie.If anything, these projects were even more acerbic, attracting further criticism. One picture editor called him a gratuitously cruel social critic who has made a large amount of money by sneering at the foibles and pretentions of other people.\u0026nbspAgain, this seems unfair. It’s hardly Parr’s fault that he’s made a decent living, and it seems harsh to describe his stance as sneering. He delights in bathos and absurdity, but his vision is dispassionate, not cruel. I continue to be amazed that people still find my work controversial, because I’m just photographing western life, the leisure pursuits of the western world.One of his most successful series, Small World, was about mass tourism, a phenomenon which straddles every class. We have this idea of what a place would be like because we’ve seen it in the pictures and the postcards. When we get there the reality is quite different. I’m showing the reality of peoples’ expectations.We have this idea of what a place would be like because we’ve seen it in the pictures and the postcards. When we get there the reality is quite differentAs beauty spots become tourist traps, that reality is pretty grim – but for Parr, it makes great photos. “I find it completely fascinating. Remember: when a place is mobbed I’m happy, because I can make my point even clearer.”\u0026nbspAnd the point is? “That the mythology is different to the reality.”The overall conclusion one draws from Parr’s photos is that consumerism is pretty tawdry, and globalisation is making a bad situation even worse. And yet, inidually, his photos are full of fun. “That’s all part of the contradiction – the ambiguity is what this is all about.”Back in Manchester, Martin is winding up his tour. Most of the pictures I take are rubbish – I take more rubbish than most people because I take more photographs than most people, he says. What you’re trying to find is that magic moment, and how and when that happens is almost impossible to predict. So, even though I’ve been doing it for many years, I couldn’t quite tell you how to do it – but you have a very strong intuitive sense when it starts to happen.Martin Parr: Return to Manchester is at Manchester Art Gallery (www.manchesterartgallery.org) until 22 April 2019Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As James Moore\u0026nbspexplains, it wouldn’t be the first example of a team machinating its own demiseClick to followThe IndependentThe Raiders’ defeat by the San Francisco 49ers earlier this month triggered much adverse commentThe Raiders are officially tanking,” declared USA Today’s Touchdown Wire last month. It’s not the first time this has been suggested by those covering the NFL for a living in response to the\u0026nbspteam’s dismal season.The contention that there’s nothing accidental about the losing streak is based on the notion that a lowly position in the final NFL standings this season\u0026nbspwould\u0026nbspsecure a favourable position in next year’s NFL draft. It allocates the first pick from each year’s pool of eligible players from the college game to the worst team, and then proceeds in reverse order, with the Super Bowl winner going last in each of seven rounds. Just over 250 rookies, many of considerable quality,\u0026nbspare selected in this manner.While no one from the team would admit it, and certainly not coach Jon Gruden\u0026nbsp(who indeed has flatly denied it), the suggestion that the Raiders are “tanking” was hard to dismiss\u0026nbspduring the 34-3 loss to the crosstown San Francisco 49ers at the start of November.Baseball players race to capture escaped ducklingsIt was a truly dreadful performance. Michael Wilbon, one of the hosts of ESPN’s talk show Pardon the Interruption, was moved to describe it as “the worst I’ve seen” from one of the league’s marque franchises.Having followed the Raiders for more than three decades, including through some very rough seasons, I couldn’t disagree.Gruden is the returning prodigal son, a man who\u0026nbspumpteen teams, both college and pro, had been trying to tempt back into the game from the broadcast booth.He was head coach during the construction of the last truly successful Raiders roster. That squad\u0026nbspwent to the Super Bowl in 2002, but ironically Gruden\u0026nbsphad by then been traded by the late Al Davis, the team’s mercurial owner, to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And the Bucs won that game.Gruden got one of the rings traditionally handed to the winners, but critics sniffed that he did it with the team of his predecessor, Tony Dungy, who himself\u0026nbspwent on to win it all with the Indianapolis Colts.Bent upon moving the Raiders franchise to Las Vegas, Davis’s son and successor as team owner Mark needed to make a splash and create some excitement. He did it by re-signing\u0026nbspGruden\u0026nbspin January, courtesy of a reported 10-year, $100m deal that is unprecedented for an NFL coach. The package offered Gruden the chance to do things\u0026nbsphis way.With the sort of security no other NFL coach has, the man nicknamed “Chucky”, after the horror movie character,\u0026nbspfor his facial expressions during games\u0026nbsphas set about tearing apart a team that went 6-10 in 2018\u0026nbspbut had made the playoffs the previous year.Gruden during the NFL Football game between Oakland Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers in November (RexThurman James)Homegrown stars such as defensive wrecking ball Khalil Mack, one of the league’s best players, and the talented, if inconsistent, receiver Amari Cooper, were traded away for future draft picks, with the team fielding a combination of ageing castoffs and ultra green rookies this year.Mack wanted a monster extension, which he got from the Chicago Bears, his new home. Cooper, now with Dallas, would soon have been after a new deal of his own. Their departures, and other moves, have given the Raiders considerable head room under the NFL’s salary cap to spend in free agency. But this year’s team is a mess, and there were times when it looked like the players had quit on their coach during the Thursday night debacle in San Francisco. The Raiders made the 49ers rookie quarterback Nick Mullens, who had gone undrafted and had never started a game, look like 49er legend Joe Montana.Could the critics have been correct? Were the Raiders\u0026nbspthrowing away a season to make themselves competitive for their projected 2020 arrival in the city of sin?The idea of winning by losing is hardly unique to the NFL. World sport is peppered with examples, perhaps the most infamous being the ‘Disgrace of\u0026nbspGijon’ in the 1982 football\u0026nbspWorld CupThe result of the trades is that the Raiders have not only accumulated spending money they also have an impressive five picks in the first round of the NFL draft over the next two years.The position of the Raiders’ traded future\u0026nbsppicks from the Dallas Cowboys and the Chicago Bears will be determined by the\u0026nbsprecords of the latter two teams. The better they do with the help of the Raiders players they have acquired, the worse the return to the Raiders will be (and the Bears look like a lock for the playoffs, with the Cowboys in with a decent shot).The Raiders’ own picks, however, will be determined by the team’s record, and after losing to the LA Chargers on 11 November\u0026nbspfollowing the 49ers debacle, they were in pole position for the top slot and a shot at another defensive wrecking ball, Nick Bosa, the Ohio State Buckeyes product, and brother of Chargers star Joey Bosa. He sits at the top of the draft boards of most experts.It’s hard to see Bosa being as good as Mack. It’s hard to see anyone being as good as Mack. But the advantage with Bosa is that he will be stuck on a relatively cheap, league-mandated rookie deal for four years, with an optional fifth.If Bosa is the man the Raiders are after, it’s easy to see how they could win by losing.There was a similar case a few years ago, when quarterback Andrew Luck was coming out of Stanford, and was seen as an even more desirable commodity – a can’t-be-missed quarterback. A team prepared to “suck for Luck”\u0026nbspwould, it was said, be set for years. The Colts won that derby, and jettisoned legend Peyton Manning as a result. Luck has been decidedly unlucky with injury, but he has looked incredible this year, and easily worth the pain of the two-win, 14-loss\u0026nbspseason the Colts endured before getting him.Created with Sketch.The 20 contenders for 2018 Sports Personality of the Year Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.121 The 20 contenders for 2018 Sports Personality of the Year121 The 20 contenders for 2018 Sports Personality of the YearThe idea of winning by losing is hardly unique to the NFL. World sport is peppered with examples. Perhaps the most infamous in what Europeans call football was the “Disgrace of Gijon” in the 1982 World Cup.Having played all its group games, Algeria had four points (at the time it was two for a win). Two of them came from the shock of the tournament when the north African side beat West Germany 2-1, the other two from a 3-2 victory over Chile. The intervening game was a 2-0 loss to Austria. With West Germany having thrashed Chile, a complex situation was created ahead of the final game between the Germans and\u0026nbspAustria. The upshot was that they could both qualify and prevent Algeria from becoming the first African side to reach the knockout stages if the Germans won by either one or two goals (a third would push Austria out).After a 10-minute barrage Horst Hrubesch found the back of the net for West Germany. The rest of the game was a depressing spectacle, with lots of passing taking place in the two teams’ own halves, and an almost complete lack of any effort to find a goal. The crowd cried foul. Actually, they cried “fix”!Both teams denied collusion and Fifa considered no rules to have been broken, but from the 1986 World Cup onwards the final pair of group matches has kicked off at the same time with the aim of preventing a repeat.Hrubesch celebrates scoring in West Germany’s controversial 1982 win against\u0026nbspAustria\u0026nbsp(RexColorsport)Cricket is a sport in which accusations of match-fixing regularly crop up, mostly as a result of players allegedly manipulating the outcome of games (or specific in-game elements) to the benefit of gambling syndicates.But teams have been known to do it for their own advantage too. The most notorious incident of this type came when Somerset captain Brian Rose declared his side’s\u0026nbspinnings closed after just six balls during a match in the early\u0026nbspstages of the one-day format\u0026nbspBenson \u0026amp Hedges Cup of 1979. Rose had worked out that his team would qualify for the second round from their group as long as they weren’t overtaken on strike rate, which was the formula in use for splitting teams at the time (it has since been replaced by net run rate)\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspirrespective of the result of the specific match.Unfortunately for the county, the game’s administrators intervened, calling an emergency meeting that led to Somerset’s expulsion. The rules of the game were subsequently changed to prevent declarations in one-day games.It isn’t just at the top level that the sort of shenanigans deemed “just not cricket”\u0026nbspoccur either. The supposedly genteel world of village cricket has seen it too, and in more recent times. Last year Carew Cricket Club made headlines nationally after declaring at 18-1 during their Pembroke County Cricket Club title-decider against second-placed Cresselly. They were 21 points clear, with 20 available for a win. But their opponents could potentially make up the gap through batting and bowling bonus points if they were to win handsomely.Man beaten to death in baseball bat attack‘10 out of 10’ drunk smashed guitar over sleeping mamba user’s headTo prevent this from happening, Carew closed its innings early, losing the game but winning the title by ensuring no bonus points could be scored. A Twitter storm ensued\u0026nbspand a disciplinary panel was set up, leading to Carew’s relegation to a lower ision, a fine and a ban for the team’s captain. But Carew kept the title. So they could still be said to have won by losing.In addition to the potential of securing an advantageous draft position –\u0026nbspand all the big four US sports of American football, baseball, basketball and ice hockey operate a variation on the draft theme –\u0026nbspit’s the absence of any\u0026nbspthreat of relegation that facilitates throwing away not just a game but the entire season in US sports. At least in theory.It might seem extreme to do it, but if you’re not a top-of-the-table contender\u0026nbspthere’s nothing to lose and everything to gain for a “rebuilding”\u0026nbspoperation. It’s more or less accepted practice in baseball\u0026nbsp(where around half the professional teams are essentially building for the future)\u0026nbspto throw in the towel come the end of July, at which time Major League Baseball imposes a trade deadline.The truth is that losing is anathema to professional athletes, particularly those who put their bodies on the line like American football players doTeams with no chance of making the end-of-year playoffs regularly swap their stars for prospects from contenders’ minor league “farm”\u0026nbspsystems. The Boston Red Sox got a pitching ace (Chris Sale) from the Chicago White Sox for four prospects in 2017, and a closer, Craig Kimbrel, from the San Diego Padres for another four in 2016. Those two were important parts of the team’s world series run this year. No one’s complaining about what the Red Sox gave up in return. Meanwhile the Padres lost 96 of their 162 games and the White Sox 100. The problem with “tanking”\u0026nbspfor tomorrow is that tomorrow doesn’t always arrive. It doesn’t matter how many prospects you accumulate if they don’t work out.The NFL draft is no more certain to improve your team than baseball prospects are. It’s a crapshoot, and although some are better than others at finding hits, Gruden’s record at Tampa wasn’t great.There is, however, a postscript to the story. The Raiders found themselves in Phoenix, Arizona on Sunday 18 November, facing the Cardinals, another struggling team in rebuilding\u0026nbspmode and with no chance of making the playoffs. Gruden’s men won a thriller courtesy of a field goal in the last second\u0026nbspthat was set up by a drive engineered by quarterback Derek Carr. Such comebacks were a hallmark of his during the 2016 playoff run.In so doing, the Raiders arguably hurt themselves, dropping from first to third in the notional draft order.\u0026nbspThey lost by winning. One headline writer said they were even managing to screw up tanking.But the truth is that\u0026nbsplosing is anathema to professional athletes, particularly those who put their bodies on the line like American football players do. The\u0026nbspraucous celebrations in the visitors’ locker room after the game showed how much victory meant. The members of the Raider nation who made their way out into the desert to watch were similarly delighted. Gruden looked pretty happy too.As the late, great Al Davis said: “Just win, baby.”\u0026nbspBecause winning’s much more fun.Still, the season isn’t over. And the road ahead will be a rocky one. The Raiders proved that by getting blown out by the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday. The remaining schedule sees the team facing the potentially Super Bowl-bound Kansas City Chiefs (twice), the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Cincinnati Bengals and the Denver Broncos in the weeks to come.It isn’t hard to see them losing the lot\u0026nbspand still having a very realistic shot at that first pick in next season’s draft. The tank\u0026nbspis still more or less on track.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But they missed it the first time around, making it one of a number of objects that the team hopes to go back and have a proper look at.The rover already snapped a photo of the object, showing its shiny coating amid the dust and rocks of the Martian surface.But it will investigate it further with other tools in an attempt to understand its chemistry. That will be done using the onboard ChemCam, a set of tools that can examine objects remotely.In the same journey, it will have a look at a number of other interesting specimens. One very small piece is “Flanders moss”, which has an interesting, dark coloured coating which the team hope to come to understand by examining its chemistry.All of the work comes after Curiosity welcomed another visitor to the planet from Earth, the InSight rover. Curiosity played Mr Rogers’ song “Won’t You Be My Neighbour”\u0026nbspto welcome its fellow visitor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This has never been done before, said astrophysicist Marco Ajello​, who is lead author of the paper. Most of this light is emitted by stars that live in galaxies. And so, this has allowed us to better understand the stellar-evolution process and gain captivating insights into how the universe produced its luminous content.The calculations allowed scientists to work out the total number of photons ever emitted.Expressing the number they found is very difficult, in part because it relies on a number of variables. But it is also literally difficult to write out, because there are so many zeroes.In all, there have been four and then 85\u0026nbspzeroes of them.Despite that vast amount of light ever emitted, very little of it ever gets to us beyond the light we see from our own sun and galaxy. The brightness of the universe as it reaches us is roughly equivalent to looking at a 60-watt lightbulb in complete darkness, from 2.5 miles away.That is because the universe is so vast and distant. But the Fermi telescope allowed the researchers to look at the dim swirl of light that comes from stars, and in so doing calculate how much light was being absorbed and therefore how much there might ever have been around.The new discovery will now allow scientists to peek out into the very beginnings of the universe.The first billion years of our universe\u0027s history are a very interesting epoch that has not yet been probed by current satellites, Ajello said. Our measurement allows us to peek inside it. Perhaps one day we will find a way to look all the way back to the Big Bang. This is our ultimate goal.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

To compound this disaster, we will have to pay out billions to replace the project.”But Ms May defended the decision, saying: “Given the European Commission’s decision to bar the UK from being fully involved in developing all aspects if Galileo, it is only right that we find alternatives.“I cannot let the armed forces depend on a system we cannot be sure of. That would not be in our national interest.“And, as a global player with world-class engineers and steadfast allies around the world we are not short of options.”\u0026nbspMPs reject Theresa May agreement, EU president Donald Tusk saysThe announcement came after the EU piled further pressure over Brexit, by rejecting the prime minister’s surprise suggestion that her deal could be renegotiated, if MPs throw it out.Donald Tusk, the European council president, said there was no other deal on offer and the only options were to leave with no deal – or to remain in the EU.“If this deal is rejected in the Commons, we are left with, as was already stressed a few weeks ago by prime minister May, an alternative. No deal or no Brexit at all. I want to reassure you that the EU is prepared for every scenario.”Meanwhile, the prime minister ducked two chances to say she can still win the crucial vote on her Brexit deal, amid mounting evidence that MPs will reject it on 11 December.She also came under pressure to push harder for the truth behind the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, after Emmanuel Macron demanded an international investigation.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Just 10 per cent said they thought the deal would produce a stronger economy while 22 per cent said “about the same” and 18 per cent replied, “don’t know”.\u0026nbspThe poll of 1,655 iniduals was conducted on Wednesday and Thursday, meaning some of those surveyed could have seen the alarming analysis of different Brexit scenarios from both the Treasury and the Bank of England.Outlining worst-case scenarios, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank, said a no-deal scenario could send the pound plunging, shrink the economy by eight per cent and that house prices could fall by almost a third.Referring to the findings, Mr Kellner added: “These are significant results, and not just because Remain’s lead is the biggest yet. For the first time, more than one in five Leave voters are having second thoughts.\u0026nbspwouldn’t be a ‘walk in the park’“While 88 per cent of those who voted Remain two years ago would vote the same way in a new referendum, the equivalent figure for Leave is down to 79 per cent.“This means that 3.5 million\u0026nbspLeave voters are having second thoughts – of whom two\u0026nbspmillion\u0026nbsphave changed sides and would now vote Remain. (The rest\u0026nbspare now don’t knows or would not vote).“The big majorities among Labour voters both for Remain and a People’s Vote also send a clear message to the party’s MPs about the decisions they will shortly face in parliament.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They\u0026nbspwere asked their opinions on their bank’s current account, and how likely they were to recommend the company. TSB’s overall score was 58 per cent, putting it in joint last place with Bank of Ireland, which was bottom of the table for the second year running. TSB sheds 20,000 current accounts in wake of massive IT failure Monzo to launch new crowdfunding round as it seeks $1bn valuationTSB boss Paul Pester steps down after new IT problemsTSB, which came in fourth in last year’s ranking, has suffered a crisis this year after a series of major IT failures, which caused\u0026nbspthousands of customers\u0026nbspto leave.Chief executive Paul Pester\u0026nbspstepped down over the tech meltdown and the chaos prompted a parliamentary inquiry. More than half of the TSB customers surveyed by Which? said they had experienced technical issues in the last year. The bank also scored poorly on customer service, telephone and online banking and complaint handling. “TSB’s slump suggests that customers felt outraged to have endured the prolonged IT issues that left millions locked out of their accounts,” said Gareth Shaw, money expert at Which?A TSB spokesperson said: “We’re sorry for the problems customers experienced as a result of our IT switch.“Regrettably this is why our scores are low in this poll. Our priority is putting things right for our customers and we’ve made significant progress.”Meanwhile, Monzo came out on top after reaching a large enough sample size for the first time since it launched in 2016. The\u0026nbsponline-only bank scored full marks for both communication and its app. With a total customer satisfaction score of 86 per cent, it narrowly beat telephone and online-only First Direct, which scored 85 per cent. Nationwide\u0026nbspcame in third\u0026nbspwith 79 per cent and challenger\u0026nbsp Bank was fourth with 76 per cent. Which? said this year’s ranking showed challenger banks were gaining favour. Mr Shaw said: “Impressive results from challenger banks place them well ahead of many of the biggest banking brands in Britain, showing that innovation and modern ideas are shaking up the market, with good customer service truly valued by customers.“Our research shows a clear gap between the best and worst providers and should act as a catalyst for customers unhappy with their service to switch banks – as it’s never been easier.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is no limit on how many times the offer can be redeemed it is valid for use once per participating shop.Small retailers in the UK could certainly do with a boost as the high street reaches the end of one of its toughest years in memory, with little sign of any easing of\u0026nbspextremely tough trading conditions.Third of small firms think pound will fall sharply after Brexit dayThis is what Facebook is doing for small businesses in the UKSmall business body calls on Hammond to address late payment ‘crisis’Shop closures jumped 17 per cent to 24,205 in the first half of the year according to the Local Data Company.The number of pubs fell 6.5 per cent in six months as people increasingly choose to buy alcohol from a supermarket and drink at home. Newsagents and clothes shops have also seen large numbers of closures thanks to falling print media sales and competition from online rivals.But research from GlobalData points to some green shoots of recovery breaking through as high streets are reshaped.It found growth in independent operators offering entertainment services like cinemas and escape rooms, hair and beauty, and health and fitness.The findings confirmed that for almost two-thirds of shoppers the desire is for experiences and opportunities\u0026nbspto buy things that can’t be easily sourced online.Maureen Hinton, retail research director at GlobalData, said it was encouraging to see that town centres were evolving to keep up with changing shopping habits.“The growth of online has also made the high street’s role as a service-led\u0026nbspsocial space increasingly important, encouraging the rise of hybrid businesses, with shops, gyms and cinemas now often boasting their own bars, coffee shops and restaurants.“Meanwhile, new categories of business continue to emerge, such as “experience bars”, which combine a night out\u0026nbspwith a complete entertainment experience, centred on an activity\u0026nbspsuch as darts, mini golf or table tennis.\u0026nbsp“There is no doubt that the high street is in a period of unprecedented change, but the rise of new businesses such as these\u0026nbspdemonstrates that this is as much an opportunity as a challenge.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Now ministers are set to use the time to fix problems in the system - but the programme wont be halted or scrapped.A series of documents revealed that a whole raft of new changes could be coming to make the transition easier for Brits -they are signed off by the Treasury.It comes after a revolt by Tory backbenchers who demanded that extra cash be put in to soften the blow for Brits on benefits.Plans have been drawn up to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to continue paying some benefits to claimants for two weeks after their new Universal Credit claim has been made.Housing benefit tenants can already get this two week space, after reports of Brits going into debt at last years Budget.The documents also revealed that more help would be given to the self employed, and that the advance payments will be spread out and paid back over a longer amount of time.Labours Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said today the news was proof that the government have quietly accepted that their flagship social security programme isnt working.She went on: The Government must stop the roll out of Universal Credit immediately. We need urgent answers from Esther McVey about whats going on and what action the Government will take to tackle the many flaws in the system.And ex-Labour MP Frank Field said the changes that could take place arent enough - and demanded benefits must continue until the new benefit is up and running into your bank account and that paying back advance payments more slowly should include other historic debts too.Dame Louise Casey said the design was flawed from the outset and it had pushed people further and further into debt because it tried to force people to be paid monthly.She told Radio : The poorest people are often paid weekly and fortnightly - those are the people we need to help... Civil servants are telling ministers this is a mess, and it needs fixing.Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Even Philippa Stroud, who used to work for the DWP, added that more money needed to be pumped in to offset cuts: Universal Credit is the right mechanism for delivering welfare, but it needs the investment restored.Campaigners including Citizens Advice welcomed the proposed moves, but said that it wouldnt solve all of the problems.Universal Credit aims to roll six benefits into one monthly payment, but the controversial new programme has been hit by a string of problems.First announced in , it was meant to be fully up and running by  - this has now been pushed back to .The new system had also been attacked for taking weeks for claimants to get their first payment, and for stopping domestic abuse victims from leaving their partners as benefits are now only paid into one account per family.Analysis from Labour revealed yesterday that Universal Credit sanctions hit Brits under  the hardest.A Department for Work and Pensions statement said today that it would be putting back the rollout.A spokesperson said: We have long said that we will take a slow and measured approach to managed migration. This will not begin in January , but later in the year, after a period of preparation.For a further year we will then begin migration working with a maximum of , people, continuing with our ‘test and learn’ approach. This is to ensure the system is working well for claimants and to make any necessary adaptions as we go.We will publish full plans for the next stage of Universal Credit rollout, including managed migration, in due course. Anything before that point is speculation and we do not comment on leaks.Claimants are able to get some cash within five days or on the same day they make a claim in emergency cases - rather than waiting weeks for their first Universal Credit payment.But the upfront payment is a loan which means youll have to pay it back.The repayments will be automatically deducted from your Universal Credit payments after youve taken the loan.You should ask for the advanceyou dont think youll have enough money to live on between when you apply and when youll get your first payment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0003730276661-e1541888658682.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour mp lives in social housing","story":"Shadow development secretary Kate Osamor has faced intense criticism after it emerged that she promoted her son in his House of Commons job, regardless of his conviction for having £, of Class A drugs with intent to supply at Bestival in Dorset last year.Now the Sun on Sunday can reveal that Ms Osamor and her son Ishmael, , are living in social housing in Tottenham, north London - despite their earnings classing them ineligible by council guidelines.Haringey Council documents from  state that households earning in excess of £, are not eligible to apply for a social housing property.And it has been reported that , people are waiting for social housing in the borough - one of the poorest in Britain - and a further , are living in temporary accommodation due to the limited supply of properties.Ms Osamor, a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, is paid a salary of £, plus expenses.

I only want to be with her. I can never wait to see her.”Cue the nation emitting a collective swoon and ’Arry becoming odds-on favourite to take the jungle crown.“Aw, he’s sooooo lovely,” gushed one twentysomething TV commentator, asHarry had just bequeathed all his worldly possessions to help save an endangered species.Given the borderline hysterical response to this “man still loves we after  years” declaration, he might even be considered one himself.But is it really so unusual  To those dating in this Tinder-centric age where people start swiping right the second there’s a minor hiccup, perhaps. But to my generation, less so.Shortly after my Uncle Jack died in his early eighties, my Aunty Mabel announced that she wouldn’t be around for much longer because she couldn’t bear to be without him. Sure enough, she literally lost the will to live and died soon after.It was the same story with my godparents and, as a trainee reporter, I interviewed countless golden wedding coupleswho had endured all manner of marital bumps in the road but lasted the course.How many of today’s liaisons will reach that -year milestone When Harry and Sandra took their vows, they clearly both understood the now largely outdated concept that love is a decision, not just a feeling.In other words, there might have been plenty of niggles and quarrels along the waybut they pushed on through in the knowledge that reaching old age with your spouse and best friend by your side is one of le’s greatest pleasures.The shared experiences, the joy of shared memories, the private jokes, the non-awkward silences and the companionship — bliss.Interestingly, Harry and Sandra’s marital set-up is one that’s increasingly regarded as outdated in this supposedly “progressive” day and age — that of the man bringing home the bacon while the woman runs the house and does the lion’s share of parenting.Consequently, Harry, now , freely admits he can barely make a cup of tea because Sandra does everything for him.It wouldn’t be my, er, cup of tea, but it has worked for them and perhaps it’s because Harry clearly doesn’t view Sandra as “just a housewe”he sees her as the boss and someone whose input he values and respects.And therein lies the key to a happy marriage. It doesn’t matter what the dynamic is as long as each feels appreciated and respected in their chosen role.Harry is what many might consider to be an old-fashioned gentleman, when men were allowed to be one without fear of being branded patronising.He turned away from the female contestants while they were showering and, whenever he gets the chance, awards “the ladies” the rare camp comforts on offer instead of the men.A magnanimous gesture, I notice, that they all accept readily without a passing thought that it might be unfair to the male contestants in these times of supposed equality for both genders.Ashley Roberts danced her bobby socks off in the Lindy hop on Saturday’s Strictly and performed a crackingly good samba too.But she ended up in the bottom two.Why  Because the public never like what they think might be a foregone conclusion.And however much the show tries to dress her up as a plucky amateur, her previous dance experience makes it as implausible as putting Bear Grylls in the I’m A Celebrity “jungle” and seeing him scream at the sight of a cockroach.Remember that moment in Crocodile Dundee when a yob pulls a blade on Mick Dundee in New York and he responds by saying “That’s not a kne”– “that’s a kne”.Fast forward  years and consider the story of Alun Powell, of Newport, Gwent, who takes part in medieval role-playing contests as “Sir Fightalot”.A court heard that when he arrived home to find his father being plagued by a gang outside the house, he pulled a sword, axe and knuckleduster from the boot of his car and “took up a fighting stance”.The prosecution added: “They saw the weapons and got so frightened that they left as quickly as possible.”Job done. End of. Right Nope. Alun ended up in court, convicted of possessing bladed articles in public and given  hours of community service.Perhaps this is why more members of the public don’t get involved when they see trouble.Becausethey don’t have a weapon themselves, they could get hurt.Andthey do happen to have one in their house or car, and brandish it in self-defence, there’s every chance they’ll end up in court themselves while the troublemakers get away scot-free.Robert de Niro is the new face of Warburtons bread.It’s hard to choose my favourite movies starring this acting titan, but Midnight Bun would be top, followed by The Kingsmill Of Comedy and Jackie Brown Bread.Posh store Anthropologie has been ridiculed for selling a bunch of twigs for £.But is the laugh on them or the idiots who buy them In the words of the marvellous Harry Enfield, it must include “we saw you coming” tax.Following on from the debate on whether or not they should have built a ramp to rescue stranded penguins, the crew of BBC’s wildle series Dynasties are in the news again for helping a stricken lion cub.As a rule, those who film such programmes are discouraged from intervening in the events they are trying to capture on the basis that nature should be allowed to take its course.But the cub was shown collapsing and spasming after eating bait laced with poison by tribesmen who had lost their cattle to a lion a few days earlier.So perhaps the new “rule” could be that human intervention is allowed when it’s human intervention that caused the crisis in the first place So how come a -year-old Iranian man – pretending to be  – was blithely placed in a class full of GCSE pupils in Ipswich without so much as a routine dental check Education Secretary Damian Hinds has added to the curriculum certain feats he wants primary school children to achieve before they move up to secondary.He says pupils will be urged to climb trees, explore caves and watch the sun rise to help build character.A good idea, but how depressing that all the things most of us did as a matter of routine in our youth now have to be actively prescribed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and has been threatened with eviction in the meantime.She told The Sun Online: “I couldn’t even afford a loaf of bread this week - my family had to give me money and cook for us.“It was my daughter’s birthday and I had to borrow the £ she was given.“I feel so guilty, I haven’t got another option.”Joanne, who can’t walk far because of her illnesses, had to visit her job centre several times to provide reams of proof before she got help - and had to beg for lts from family and friends to get there.Her husband previously sorted out her finances, but has now moved out of the family home leaving her and their two kids Hannah, , and Zoe, , behind.Joanne, who lives in the West Midlands, is just one of hundreds of Brits who say that going onto Universal Credit has pushed them into debt.In last month’s Budget the Chancellor announced a raft of measures to help ease their struggle - but they won’t come in for months.New DWP Secretary Amber Rudd has vowed to “fix” the problems with the flagship benefits system, which rolls six payments into one.Last week she even hinted she could slash the five-week wait to try and help those who are desperate waiting for their first payment.Joanne’s got letters and phonecalls saying she is almost £ in debt on her rent alone - and could face eviction from her houseshe doesn’t pay soon.She opted for a £ advance to help her while she waited but soon struggled with making ends meet.“I’m struggling to pay for anything including food for my girls,” she added.“I’ve been worried to death, I haven’t had anything to eat some days.“I’ve been going around to my family to get food - it makes me feel so bad.“Dad paid for us all to come over with a taxi so we could have a meal.”After waiting five weeks for her benefits to come through, she is now set to get around £, a month from UC - and her PIP disability payments are paid on top ofBut it was the “huge struggle” of waiting for it all to come through which really put a strain on the family, she said.Joanne’s former partner used to do everything beforehand for her, adding: “I never really did any shopping - or even had a bank account.”She’s slashed her bills to the minimum amount she feels is possible but still is struggling to pay the bills.“Universal Credit has been a nightmare, the benefits system should have been left how it is,” she added.“It’s caused me so much trouble and stress.”A DWP spokeswoman said: “We offer advances of up to  per cent of the first Universal Credit payment to help people who need extra support, and we’ve announced a £m partnership with Citizens Advice to support vulnerable people with their claims.“Other benefits, such as Personal Independence Payments, are available for people with mental and physical health conditions to help with additional costs.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004516094471-e1543445105186.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"britain needs brexit leaders steve hilton opinion","story":"It says: “Consider the possibility we are led by idiots.”When you look at the shambles Brexit has become, as far as Britain is concerned it’s not a possibility but a downright certainty.Let’s review the idiocy.It began with David Cameron stomping off in the biggest and most ruinous huff in history, leaving a sleep-deprived and shell-shocked Tory party scrambling to find a new leader overnight.Then Boris Johnson and Michael Gove threw away a golden opportunity as potential PM and deputy to achieve the vision of a positive, outward-looking, go-getting, post-Brexit Britain.Over a bizarre few days they stabbed each other in the back, shot themselves in the foot and indulged in whatever other self-harming metaphor you can think of.Their antics landed us with hapless and hopeless Theresa May, so desperate to prove she could deliver Brexit despite opposing it that she rushed into announcing the end-point without the faintest idea how to get there.More misguided Remainer pandering came from then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd, with her ludicrous plan to force businesses to list their foreign workers.This offensive announcement alienated Remain voters who might have given Brexit a chance and helped set in stone the horrible isiveness of the past two years.As Foreign Secretary, Boris made one gaffe after another, starting with the most heinous: Sticking to his silly remark about having your cake and eating it — guaranteed to wind up the EU bigwigs and make them even more determined to give Britain a rotten deal.On and on the idiocy has gone — from Philip Hammond trying to prove his discredited Project Fear predictions were right all along by being the most anti-businessConservative Chancellor anyone can remember, to Matt Hancock’s hysterical claims about people dying from a lack of medicineswe leave the EU without a deal. He is the Health Secretary, for God’s sake. Why doesn’t he get the medicines, instead of issuing stupid threats At least Michael Gove’s pitul descent into Project Fear ignominy, with his own Hancockian warning about running out of drinking water, turns out to be fake news — or so I’m told.And where has all this left us With a Brexit “deal” that is not really a deal and doesn’t actually deliver Brexit. The transition period leaves Britain subject to most EU rules, and there is no agreement on what comes next — just an agenda for more negotiations.How dare Mrs May say last Sunday, “The British people don’t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit. They want a good deal that fulfils the vote” Her plan guarantees years more “arguing about Brexit” and obviously doesn’t fulfil the vote. I know politicians spin everything but this is in a dferent league. It’s not spin, Prime Minister — what you are saying is a bare-faced lie, and you know it.It is also disgraceful that the civil service is helping push out this lying propaganda at taxpayers’ expense with its Cabinet Office “Project Vote” operation.But we shouldn’t be surprised. The senior civil service has catastrophically mishandled Brexit all along, finally exposing as self-serving fiction the idea that it is the professional, reliableof the national interest, there to save the nation from the half-baked schemes of here today, gone tomorrow politicians.Yes indeed: “Consider the possibility we are led by idiots.”But now what, you might say. It’s easy to criticise — what would you do Well, I’ve said it before : Pursuing a “deal” with the EU is a waste of time. Of course you can’t stay in the single market but regain control of immigration. Of course you can’t stop paying membership fees but still set the rules. And as President Trump noted, of course you can’t strike new trade deals unless you fully leave.There is no such thing as a “soft Brexit”. There is Brexit, without adjectives — or staying in the EU in some form. “Fulfilling the vote” now requires two things: Preparing for a clean break and counteracting the inevitable short-term disruption.Disgracefully, and cynically, the Government refused to prepare for a clean break over the past two years, so now we are behind. But that doesn’t mean we can’t do it — it just means an all-out effort must be made, andnecessary the exit date pushed back.However solid the preparations, though, there is bound to be economic turbulence. But here too, we can be proactive. The Government could almost instantly make Britain the world’s top destination for business and investment.Slash corporation tax and regulations. Roll out the red carpet for entrepreneurs, scientists, investors. Commit to building the world’s most modern infrastructure and best-trained workforce.Business hates uncertainty more than anything. That is why Theresa May’s deal is a disaster — it prolongs uncertainty.A clean break and a radical pro-enterprise agenda would end uncertainty and counteract the short-term shock of departure.Once we have left, and shown how dynamic post-Brexit Britain can be, we will have much more leverage to negotiate a trade deal with the EU.Objectors will say: This is fantasy — there is no majority in Parliament for a clean break. But there is no majority for anything  either, and in any case, with a clean-break scenario the EU Withdrawal Act does not require a vote that binds the Government.But perhaps the biggest question is: Who can make this happen My idea of bringing back Cameron went down like a lead balloon. After the Rees-Mogg rebellion flopped, we are stuck with Mrs May — evenshe loses on December . No one can see a way out.There is only one answer. Pro-Brexit MPs, inside and outside Cabinet, must develop a spine, step up and unite to offer a positive alternative.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Other benefits like Carers Allowance, Personal Independent Payments, and Child Benefit are still separate to Universal Credit and wont be part of your lump payment.But the income from that could affect your Universal Credit amount.You might need to book and attend an interview at your local Jobcentre before you get your first payment.Once you have successfully applied and have given all the relevant information, it will take five weeks for your first sum to come through.But you can apply for an advance  you dont feel youll be able to manage financially until that happens. The money you owe will be taken off your UC sum in future months.After youve applied you can sign in to your Universal Credit online account to report changes in circumstances, add notes to your journal, see anything you need to do, and check when your payment is coming."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004506571551-e1543531251522.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn trying to ruin economy","story":"Just the threat of the lelong Marxist in Downing Street has seen huge amounts of cash leave the UK, and it could be just a taster.We don’t buy the ridiculous Project Fear sequel.But imagine the Bank’s apocalyptic scenario is anywhere half-close to true.Now imagine a Corbyn government committed to massive increases in corporation and income tax, a wealth windfall tax, and nationalising everything within touching distance.Even the Shadow Chancellor has said there’d be a run on the Pound.It’d make even the most chaotic clean break look a walk in the park.People think Venezuela-style destitution could never happen in Britain.

A growing number of other ministers share this concern.Theresa May, of course doesn’t want no deal. She wants Parliament to approve the deal she has negotiated.But, right now, it is hard to see how it passes.The DUP have said they won’t vote for it, denying the Government its majority, and  Tory MPs have declared they will vote against it — ­suggesting the Government is on course for a heavy defeat.“It is increasingly dficult to see what rescues this,” said one of those charged with getting it through.Given thatthe withdrawal agreement is defeated and nothing is put in its place then this country leaves the EU without a deal, it is foolish not to massively intensy planning for that outcome.At every point since the ­referendum, the Government has put off crucial decisions on no-deal planning.This has weakened the UK’s negotiating position and means the UK is now ill-prepared for what Mrs May admits is one of the three most likely outcomes.The situation is so serious that one member of the Privy Council told me this week that the military should be drafted in to help.This former Cabinet minister’s argument was that only the military had the logistical know-how to ensure that ­critical supplies make it all around the country in time.May still hasn’t given up on getting the withdrawal agreement through Parliament.But there is little sign of a decisive sht in her favour.Cabinet ministers are still talking in terms of the scale of defeat, rather than of victory.The expectation among ­ministers is thatMay loses the vote by  or less, she will seek clarication on the ­backstop and then try and bring it back to the Commons.But, as one leading member of the Cabinet warns, May will have to move fast.If she loses the meaningful vote she “could face the  letters and a vote of no confidence in short order”.THE Housing Secretary, James Brokenshire, has scored a ­signicant victory over the Chancellor.Brokenshire wanted to reduce the maximum deposit that renters would have to pay from six weeks’ rent to five.The idea was that this would be fairer on tenants who must find the money for the deposit up front. But Philip Hammond objected.The Chancellor wrote to Cabinet colleagues that “I cannot agree to the proposed concession to lower the deposit cap from six weeks’ rent to five weeks’ rent.“Six weeks’ rent was already placing landlords at risk of uncovered loss for damage to property, as well as risk of loss of rent.“This bill was always a high- risk measure. A cap of six weeks’ rent was already a major concession and I believe we have to hold the line at this level.”However, Hammond’s objections have not carried the day. The Government will now back reducing the deposit cap to five weeks for all but the most expensive properties.One of the Tories’ biggest problems is being seen as the landlords’ party. Hammond himself declares rental income of more than £,.In , the Tories were more popular than Labour among those who rented in the private sector.But at the last election, ­Labour had a -point lead over the Tories among private renters.The Tories won’t win these voters back by dragging their feet on measures that make le easier for tenants.SENIOR Labour figures are plotting a route to an early General Election that doesn’t involve having to get two thirds of the Commons to vote for it.One close ally of Jeremy Corbyn in the Shadow Cabinet tells me that the plan would be to defeat the Government in a confidence motionthe ­Government loses the meaningful vote.The idea would be to persuade the DUP to join with Labour and the other opposition parties in voting against the Government. This would result in a narrow defeat for Theresa May.At that point, the Fixed Term Parliament Act allows  days for the Commons to approve an alternative government.In these circumstances, no government could be approved – the DUP wouldn’t actively put ­Corbyn into No  while no Tory leader could be elected in that time who would meet the DUP’s requirements on the backstop.The result of all this would be that with ­Parliament deadlocked, there would have to be another General Election.How realistic the Labour front bench consider this scenario is crucial. For there is mounting tension in the Shadow Cabinet about whether or not Labour should formally back a second referendum.At the moment, Labour’s policy is to push for a General Election above all .But this week, John McDonnell – the Shadow Chancellor – admitted that securing a General Election was “very dficult” so the party may well back a second referendum instead.TORY party donors have received a letter from party HQ defending the deal that Theresa May has ­negotiated.Attached to the letter is a rather revealing document setting out why “the backstop is needed in all scenarios”.It lists four future scenarios for UK EU relations – a Canada-style trade deal, EEA membership, a UK EU customs union and the UK being in both the customs union and the single market.Three of these four options would be deemed unacceptable by most Brexiteer MPs.WHEN the then Culture Secretary Matt Hancock scrapped Leveson , the next stage of the inquiry into the Press, critics claimed that either Parliament or the courts would force him into a U-turn.But the key votes in the Commons were won, and this week the courts rejected the appeal for a judicial review of the decision.With Labour having gone cold on Section , which would have forced newspapers to sign up to a state regulator or pay both sides’ costs in disputes, the freedom of the Press remains.The challenge now is never to allow it to be threatened in this way again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The French President told the de-facto Saudi ruler that international experts need to be involved in the investigation into his death. Mr Macrons demand came shortly before Theresa May held face-to-face talks with the crown prince in which she promised to send a robust message about the murder, as well as the war in Yemen. Bin Salman has appeared isolated among fellow world leaders at the G summit in Argentina, with the exception of a vigorous public handshake from Russias Vladimir Putin - himself treated as a pariah by some of those present. The crown prince was filmed in an apparently tense conversation with Mr Macron, telling the French president not to worry. Mr Macron responded: I am worried...You never listen to me.   The widely-shared video showed bin Salman replying: I will listen, of course. It concluded with Mr Macron saying: I am a man of my word. Later, an Elysee Palace official said the president had conveyed a very firm message on the need for international involvement in the Khashoggi investigation, currently the subject of two separate probes by Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Mrs May said she would use her meeting to press Britains call for a credible and transparent investigation into Mr Khashoggis death in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October and urge Mohammed to ensure his country offers full co-operation to the Turkish investigation.   Mrs May was also pressing the Crown Prince to ensure his countrys engagement in talks in Stockholm next week to find a political solution to the bloodshed in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting Houthi rebels. Amnesty International UKs director Kate Allen said Mrs May should politely but firmly insist that only a UN investigation into the grisly murder of Jamal Khashoggi is going to be sufficient. Speaking to Sky News ahead of the meeting, Mrs May said: It is the relationship we have with Saudi Arabia that enables me to sit down with him and be robust on our views on two issues. On the Khashoggi case, she said Riyadh must ensure that their investigation is a full investigation, that it is credible, that it is transparent and that people can have confidence in the outcome of it and that those responsible are held to account.   And she said she was very concerned about the humanitarian situation in Yemen resulting from the long-running conflict. Now is the time, there is an opportunity to find a solution, said the PM. I will be encouraging all parties, including the Saudi Arabians, to ensure that they sit down at the upcoming UN-led talks in Stockholm in the coming days and weeks and find a way through this, find a political solution for a stable future for Yemen. Mrs May also held talks with the summits host, President Mauricio Macri, at which the long-standing dispute over the sovereignty of the Falklands took a back seat as discussions focused on trade.   Mrs May presented keen Queen fan Macri with a book about the rock band, while the Argentine president gave her a special cup for drinking national beverage Yerba Mate herbal tea. Mrs May is the first Conservative Prime Minister to visit Argentina since the  war, and only the second serving PM to do so, after Tony Blair briefly crossed the border from Brazil in . Mr Macri has toned down official rhetoric over the islands Argentina knows as Las Malvinas since taking over from Cristina Kirchner in . This weeks announcement of a new air link between the Falklands and the South American mainland via Argentina has been greeted in London as an indication that relations are headed in a positive direction. Speaking during her flight to Buenos Aires, Mrs May said the establishment of the flight showed a dferent relationship developing. I am talking to President Macri about issues about trade and opportunities for trade, but our position on the sovereignty of the Falklands hasnt changed and will not change, she added.

The camera pans to a grim-faced Tess Daly, stood in Elstree Studios in army fatigues and camouflage paint. Good evening and welcome to Strictly Brexit... Get Me Out Of Here! Next to her, Declan Donnelly - in a gorgeous pink floaty ballgown perfect for the Viennese waltz - shouts: Its politics week, and our final contestants are going head-to-head in the shout-off. Please welcome, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn!The studio audience clap despondently in the trees as Theresa abseils to the ground dressed as a giant sequinned eagle . Jeremy joins her in a small wheeled kayak filled with cockroaches all muttering about Palestine.The two take up position at podiums in the centre of the dancefloor, as forest rangers screw large, transparent plastic boxes to their heads.

Please welcome our judges, who will deliver their verdict on your technical performance. You will be subject to a phone vote and at the end of the show one of you WILL be leaving the contest. Spotlights fall upon the pair, and Theresa speaks first. Im standing up for Britain, she begins, then squeaks as a Jacob bites her on the nose and tells her shes hysterical. This is a deal that will give us control of our borders, she continues, while an Arlene crawls into her ear demanding Northern Ireland has special treatment but is also treated just the same. This is the best we could hope for, she adds as a Boris slithers down her blouse looking for his point.Jeremy then takes his turn. We respect the referendum, but were going to stop the government acting on it, he says, with a cough. Theresa has botched the deal, and we could do a better onewe just go back to the start again, he gasps. A second referendum is an option but we prefer a... general election... we had a peoples vote already...he continues breathlessly, going blue in the face.Nobody is ruling out remain, Keir whispers. Jeremys eyes bulge. Keir goes on: We need single market access or the economy will collapse. Jeremy begins clawing at his box.

You need to really point those toes, yes, arch your nose a little more, yes She collapses back into ennui as Bruno leaps to his feet, grinds his pelvis and shouts: THERESA THE PLEASER! My God, woman, the way you travelled the floor with those backbenchers trying to destroy you reminded me of Anton du Beke and Ann Widdecombe. You are the one to beat, but I must admit my darling the footwork was a little illogical, you havent really sold it to me. The camera pans to Craig, whose face resembles the morning after a whisky bottle and a bad break-up. The whole thing has been a dis-AAAAAAAA-ster, darlings. Neither of you made me happy, you both fudged your fleckles, and Im afraid the only paddle youll see is when the nation tells you both to get in the sea, darling.Dec turns to Shirley.

Jeremy, you got... NO votes of approval. Theresa, you got... NO votes of approval. So we go to the votes of disapproval, she says.She takes a deep breath. Jeremy, you got disapproval votes from the majority of your shadow cabinet, your parliamentary party, and your party membership as a whole. Theresa, you got parliamentary disapproval votes only from Boris, Jacob and their friends, but also Im afraid the vast majority of your party members, Brexiters, Remainers, and readers of the .Overall, neither of you has won. So we go to sudden death.A crash of drums, and a spotlight falls upon stage left. Dec says: You will now present your business plans to Claude Littner. Claude enters, flanked by feather-covered dancers. This is a bloody disgrace!, he barks. Theresa, none of your figures add up. Ive read through your deal and its exceptional. Exceptionally BAD, that is. If this had been suggested on day  it would have been laughed out. And Jeremy. Youre talking nonsense, arent you  Quite clearly the statements youre making are ludicrous. Youre not a big fish. Youre not even a fish! Frankly, youre both parasites. This contest is terminated.Claude exits. Tess and Dec look at each other and the cameras, uncertain of what to do. In their earpieces, a producer wonders about the wisdom of getting Mr Blobby on with a bucket of crocodile eyes. Bollocks to this, says a member of the audience, standing up. Youre all hopeless. No-one voted for the Tories to disentegrate, no-ones pointed out this is a transition agreement, not the actual deal. If youre all this hopeless just limbering up, what hope do we have of winning the thing  Ive heard enough. Youre all bloody fired.  We wont get any that, of course. Those who organise political debates rarely include a gunge machine, and politicians who behave like infants whove lost a rattle ironically think such stunts would be childish.Instead, the broadcasters will put the debate on just before the Im A Celeb final or after the Strictly semi-final. The question is not who gets voted out, but whether its a BBC audience, a more-plebby ITV one, and whether anyone will watch for more than  minutes.Which is a shame, because as a country we have more faith in X Factor phone votes than we do the ones cast in the ballot box.

Katie Cornwall, , suffers from Asperger’s syndrome, so at times she does not understand her surroundings in the same way others would. Miss Cornwall regularly shops in Hull and often wears bed socks and UGG boots, even at the height of summer, because it makes her feel comfortable. However following a shopping trip to Boots and Debenhams on Thursday, she was left in floods of tears. Hull Live reports that her mum, Catherine Cornwall, claims her daughter was followed out of Boots by security staff. She believes staff then called ahead to Debenhams to warn them that she may be heading there, which led to her being evicted from the store. She says she is dismayed at how her daughter’s condition was treated by staff. Boots has already issued an apology for an “honest misunderstanding” while Debenhams has encouraged them to contact the store manager. Catherine says that while the biggest impact has been felt by her daughter, she has also been left distraught by what happened. “I’ve been in bits this morning thinking she was just getting somewhere but it’s set her back,” she said.  “In Katie’s mind, they were keeping a close eye on her. She felt that they were on her. Katie began by shopping in Boots, where she was buying Christmas gts for her boyfriend, before moving on to the Prospect Street department store, where she claims she was “marched out” by security. Katie’s mum believes it is more likely that she felt hassled to leave after picking up on security guards paying extra attention to her in both shops, and would have felt more pressured than usual given her autistic Asberger’s syndrome. Explaining what she claims happened to her daughter during her trip, Catherine said: “She has autistic Asperger’s. She dresses dferently but that’s her only crime. “She ended up in tears. She said the security had been watching her in Boots and she said she went across to Debenhams and they marched her out the shop. “She’d been looking at some children’s clothing which fit her because she’s really tiny. She’d done nothing wrong.” Katie only looks like a teenager according to her mum, which could have raised suspicions. She often takes the bus into Hull from her home in Patrington to look around the shops and to treat herself as well as her partner, but her mum now says the experience might have put her off venturing into town on her own again. “She goes around and looks around by herself looking at things,” Catherine said.  “I don’t knowshe wants to go in those places ever again. She went back to my mum’s saying she daren’t go into town again. “She’s a vulnerable adult. If you’re a vulnerable adult, you shouldn’t be picked out.” Catherine is now calling for more understanding from staff in shops to make sure others aren’t left feeling as uncomfortable as her daughter did. “I can’t believe thatsomeone looks dferent they would call around all the shops saying to watch out for her. “Not everyone is perfect and I want people to be aware of people’s dferences.” In a statement, a spokeswoman for Boots UK apologised for the misunderstanding. They have also offered to meet with the family so they can once again feel comfortable while shopping at the store. The statement reads: “We would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our sincere apologies for this honest misunderstanding and for any inconvenience or distress caused.

Now, five months after she came into the world, Sussie made it home from the neonatal unit to be with her family in time for Christmas. Lee Patrick, who lives in Birkenhead, said that his partners pregnancy was perfectly normal and healthy - with no indication Sussie would be born so prematurely.

He is the longest-serving resident across all three of Battersea’s sites – he’s been in their care for well over  days. The average stay for a dog is  days, which shows just how long Aidan has been waiting to find a family to love him. There is no limit on how long an animal can stay at Battersea. For cats, the average stay is  days. Aidan has found it extremely dficult to cope living in kennels for such a long period and is currently spending time in a foster home where he can put his paws up while he waits for a new family to love. Kaye Mughal, centre manager at Battersea Old Windsor, said: “Christmas is one of Aidan’s favourite times of year. Monster who stabbed his we  times blamed cough medicine “He loves nothing more than being wrapped up in a big fluffy blanket, watching Christmas films and being surrounded by his favourite toys. “It’s heartbreaking for us that he won’t be spending this Christmas with a new family unless someone makes that call. Aidan is a sensitive soul and can get quite nervous in new situations, which has put people off rehoming him in the past. However, since being in Battersea’s care, he’s become much more confident. “Aidan needs a home with an owner who is willing to continue his training and work with him to bring out the best dog that he can be. We really hope he will find someone who has opened their hearts and home to this lovely boy, in the true spirit of Christmas.”  Aidan needs a particular type of setting to fulfil his potential. He is fully house trained and provided he has been walked, can be left alone for an hour or two. He likes the sound of his own bark and needs an owner who would not be put off by this – and he can’t live with cats or other dogs. Families with young kids probably wouldn’t be best suited. Ideally he would be better off away from the inner city and would be fine in a family with teenagers.If you are interested in giving Aidan a home, visit battersea.org.uk to find out more about him, email bow.rehomers@battersea.org.uk or call   ."},{"url":null,"title":"christmas weather forecast uk blasted","story":"NewsChristmas weather forecast: UK to be blasted with ice, wind and snow over festive periodA white Christmas could happen in the UK, an ex BBC weather presenter says as Coral slashes odds on festive snowShareCommentsByBradley Jolly:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video watch-weather-forecast-weekend-more-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritain is braced for reservoir of cold Arctic air which will cause a sudden blast of wet and windy weather - and lead to increasing chances of snow for the festive period. Forecasters say the weather is on a kne-edge and therefore we cant write off a white Christmas already. Former BBC meteorologist John Hammond said: I expect a greater dominance of colder weather. Mild and wet conditions are more likely to be restricted to southwestern areas. The iding line is impossible to call, but will be crucial in terms of snowfall. [Theres] increasing chance of snow later in [this] period. But Mr Hammond, who now writes his forecasts on blog weathertrending, stressed temperatures will drop in the next two weeks, particularly in the north-east of England.

John Hill, the bookies spokesman, said: Punters are dreaming of a White Christmas as we have been knocked over in recent days with bets on snow to fall on the big this year,” said Coral’s John Hill. “The betting suggests snow is more likely to come down in the major Scottish cities, however, it is not stopping punters backing flakes to fall in London too. It supports reports insignicant snowfall will hit the UK in late December during the UKs snowiest winter in  years. And experts saythe mercury does indeed plunge, forecasted rain could fall as snow in some parts of the UK. The Met Offices long-term forecast states: Some wet and possibly windy weather is likely in the west, with the east having generally drier weather with some fog, frost and possibly some snow showers too.  Spells of rain and strong winds are set to spread across the British Isles from the west, although remaining most active across western and northwestern areas. Speaking earlier this week, James Madden, of Exacta Weather, said: “After this brief interlude of milder weather there will be a quick reversal back to cold conditions accompanied by wintry weather and some notable snow showers, particularly, across the north. “This will pave the way for a number of further snow events during the early to mid part of December, some of these could be severe enough to cause disruption.

The past few months have been unbearable. The -year-old began to suffer from migraines and dry eyes shortly after his surgery but Canadian doctors were unable to diagnose what was causing his pain.  Desperate for answers the self-made-millionaire travelled to Europe and the US to find a specialist who could help. He began treatments and underwent more surgeries which only made the pain worse.Pauls parents Gene and Christine Fitzpatrick spoke to CTV about their son.Christine said: We didnt know what to do for him. We would recommend pain killers and he would take some. He wasnt one to take pain killers much, but when they wore off he said the pain was worse so hed keep his eyes closed most of the time.  Gene said his son had researched the procedure - photorefractive keratectomy- and said he felt it was safer because there was less cornea used. PKR was the first form of laser eye surgery and involves removing the thing, top layer of the eye and discarding it before the underlying corneal tissue is reshaped using a laser in order to sharpen vision. Now his family believe he suffered from a rare, yet severe condition known as corneal neuralgia - although he never received a diagnosis for it.

A lack of play can cause  shybehavioural problems, including shyanxiety, aggression, pulling on the lead, whining and not coming when called, a Bristol University study found. Dog trainer Dominic Hodgson said: “It’s heartbreaking that thousands of dogs are handed in to shelters and even put to sleep. This could be avoided by owners simply understanding they need attention and stimulation.” Many people spend eight hours away from home each day, so dogs are left to develop destructive habits such as chewing, digging and getting into bins.

But Dominic says the key to having a happy dog is the time you spend with them. And he reckons owners need to be as entertaining as another dog. He said: “By making walks fun – shytaking out a tennis ball, a toy, even a smelly old sock – you can bond and take away the stress of them being badly behaved through boredom.” Dominic claims many owners get overwhelmed trying to follow shycomplicated advice on dog psychology and behaviour and then give up.  He has written a book, Worry Free Walks, explaining how to build a better shyrelationship with your dog. Dominic, , from Sunderland, said: “The reason dogs behave better with walkers and trainers is because they work harder to get their attention. “Start by playing with their toys and get them to focus on you in the house or where there’s little distraction. “Each time you go on a walk, take a bag with their favourite toys and tasty treats and play with them.

They are not natural chums, a royal aide has now cautiously admitted to the Daily Mail. The two Duchesses are undoubtedly very dferent characters from dferent backgrounds, with Kate having aristocratic ties and Meghan being a former Hollywood actress. Now royal experts are saying that the sisters-in-laws dferences mirror a previous royal feud, between the Queen Mother and Wallis Simpson - which, it seems, was a far more dramatic row.  Like Meghan, Wallis was an American orcee. She captured King Edward VIIIs heart, and he decided to abdicate, choosing love over his duty, and gave up his spot on the throne in . The Queen Mothers husband, the younger brother of Edward, then reluctantly took the throne as George VI, and was said to have felt very unprepared for the role. The Queen mum blamed Wallis for her husbands early death when he died in , aged just . Elizabeth never married again, remaining a widow for the next  years until she died in , aged . Although nothing remotely as dramatic as this has happened between Meghan and Kate, people have observed some similarities - and its mostly down to their dference in character.  Royal experts Richard Kay and Geoffrey Levy write that there are also parallels in the way Harry and Edward chose to distance themselves from royal le. There are uneasy similarities in the frosty relationship between Meghan and the Duchess of Cambridge as there were between Wallis and the then Duchess of York, later the Queen Mother, they wrote in the Daily Mail. They describe Kate as reminiscent of the young Queen Mother, dutul, committed and cautious and Meghan as a glossy American. But not everyone sees the parallels, Andrew Morton, the author of the biography, Wallis In Love, told MailOnline that Meghan is much more selfless than Wallis. He said: Meghan seems to have a sense of wanting to give back, whereas Wallis only ever wanted to take.  Another key dference is that Meghan is adored by the public, whereas Wallis was not very popular. A source told the Mirrors royal correspondent that although they arent close, there hasnt been a big fall out. They said: Its obvious the two women are pretty dferent and while they haven’t been involved in a soap opera-style falling out, they aren’t exactly the best of friends. These comments follow recent claims that Meghan and Kate fell out over Meghans treatment of the Duchess of Cambridges staff. The claims, denied by the Palace, allegedly took place before Meghan and Harry’s wedding in May, the source told The Sun. They said: Her and Kate fell out when she b*****ked Kates staff. Kate reportedly told the former Hollywood actress: “Thats unacceptable, they’re my staff and I speak to them. The source said to the Sun: Its a tricky situation, but it was a one-off and they are determined to maintain a positive relationship even though they are obviously very dferent in their approach.

All of the gts are bought from just one shop - Harrods - and has been known to wander around the closed store for hours selecting presents.In recent years, it has become tradition for Princes William and Harry to play a Christmas Eve football match alongside workers from the Sandringham Estate, with the Princes always on opposing sides. They usually wear the socks of their favorite teams - Aston Villa for William and Arsenal for Harry - and they take it pretty seriously. But theres nothing serious around the red drawing room at the estate come Christmas Eve, when the royals hand each their gag gts to one another.The rule is that no-one should open their present until given permission by Philip, who supervises the proceedings, and that every present should be a cheap “joke gt”, and the cheaper the better.

There are decorations to hang, food to prepare and presents to buy.And it will come as no surprise that each royal has their own traditional tipple - or two - that they like to drink on Christmas Day. Prince Charles reportedly prefers cherry brandy or a   martini made from gin and dry vermouth.While William and Harry both enjoy a pint of beer or Sandringham cider, made from apple trees planted by the Queen’s father King George VI. Philip is reportedly an avid beer lover, with Boddingtons being his favorite. While Camilla is understood to enjoy a gin and tonic. Kate is said to enjoy red wine, particularly Merlot, or she likes a Jack Daniels whiskey. Meanwhile, the Queen loves nothing more than a cocktail called the Zaza, made from Dubonnet and gin. The Queen Mother was also said to be a big fan of the drink too.This year, it will be Meghans second Christmas at Sandringham House, the Queens country estate in Norfolk, but her first as Prince Harrys we - and as an expectant mum, so theyll be no sipping sherry under the mistletoe for the duchess. As we previously reported, while Christmas naps are custom in a lot of households to sleep off the booze, there is no sneaking in forty winks for the Royal Family - instead there is a bedtime rule. The family are said to play charades until midnight, with nobody permitted to go to bed until Her Majesty retires. So no matter how tired one is, they must stay awake until the Queen decides shes had enough.   Meanwhile, their Christmas lunch starts at .pm with a starter of salad with shrimp or lobster, followed by roasted turkey with traditional sides like parsnips, Brussels sprouts and carrots, then Christmas pudding with brandy butter for dessert. Menus are all in French and the family eat from blue and white Copeland dinner service and drink from crystal stemware engraved with EIIR. As is tradition, just before the family tuck in, the senior chef goes into the dining room and carves the turkey, after which the Queen presents him with a glass of whiskey and they toast - the only time in the year that the chef joins the royals in the dining room. Meanwhile, The Queen has three strict rules when the Royal Family open Christmas presents. And there is a heartbreaking reason the Queen doesnt take down Christmas decorations until February.

The breed of cattle have freakish muscle-bound bodies due to a naturally occurring gene mutation called double muscling.But many are convinced that farmers have been injecting the bodybuilder bulls with steroids sparking a furious row online.It comes after Knickers, a ft ins steer from Australia, hit the headlines for being too big to to be butchered.While Knickers achieved fame because of his height, these Belgian Blues boast bulging muscles all over their bodies. While its a natural occurrence, some still claim their muscle mass is due to steroid injections.This should be illegal to inject so much hormones and steroids into any animal it takes it out of its natural healthy looking character. This is sick and sad, one commenter online wrote.It should be illegal to inject steroids into any animal... it takes it out of its natural healthy looking character, another added.But others hit back at the steroid claims and explained their bulging muscles are due to genetics.This is a Belgian breed of cattle that looks like this because of a genetic mutation that results in increased muscle mass!!! So stop this steroid and animal cruelty nonsense.  However, the breed do suffer from a number of health problems as a result of their beefcake bodies.Pregnancies can be dficult and calves often have to be delivered via c-section.The calves often suffer from birth defects, such as enlarged tongues, which makes it dficult for them to feed from their mother.As oversized cows continue to hit the headlines, a farmer in Canada has claimed his steer is even bigger than Aussie beast Knickers. Karl Schoenrock, who runs Kismet Creek Farm in Manitoba, has come forward and said his friendly big black steer Dozer is a whole inch taller than colossal ft  Knickers. Karl and we Raelle decided to get out a measuring tape after seeing Knickers story go viral and they were pleasantly surprised when Dozer came up at a whopping ft . “He’s just the friendliest animal,” Karl told the New York Post. “He’s not very intimidating at all, except for his size. If you stood next to him he’ll just lay down next to you.”  Although both Dozer and Knickers have been described as cows, they are in fact steers - a male bovine that has been neutered. The term cow refers to female cattle who have had a calf. As we previously reported, Knickers, who weighs a whopping st, eats more than kg of grass and grain each day. Hes so large he cannot be slaughtered in an abattoir and made into steaks.

There were more than , new HIV diagnoses in Russia in , taking total cases to more than .million, but the number of infected people is believed to be higher. The situation has concerned experts - who marked World Aids Day on Saturday - as Russia and Ukraine account for  per cent of all new infections in Europe amid a global decline. Russia faces an escalating crisis with a rate - . new infections per , people - that is more than  times that of Western Europe .  Most new cases in the former Soviet Union in  were from\u2028 heterosexual sex as the disease spreads beyond high-risk groups,\u2028 according to research by the World Health Organisationand\u2028 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\u2028 The increased rate of new diagnoses in the region since \u2028 comes amid a global decline. Masoud Dara, HIV specialist at\u2028 the WHO, said it could be an early indication of overspill in\u2028 the general population.\u2028 He told the Thomson Reuters Foundation: HIV starts offkey populations - meaning drug users,\u2028 commercial sex workers and men having sex with men - but after\u2028 that itexponentially ...there is no more\u2028 intervention.  Russias figures are probably an understatement, said experts. Nikolay Lunchenkov, a doctor at the Moscow\u2028 Regional Aids Centre, said: We dont have enough medication, we dont treat every\u2028 patient. We are increasing the number of people who receive\u2028 antiretroviral therapy, but its still not enough.\u2028 The number of HIV treatment courses bought by the Russian\u2028 government rose  per cent to about , last year, according\u2028to the Treatment Preparedness Coalition, an NGO. But methadone, which research has shown helps to prevent\u2028 injecting drug users passing on HIV, is banned in Russia.  Cases\u2028 have increased in Crimea since it was annexed from Ukraine in\u2028 , according to the Moscow Times.\u2028 Mr Lunchenkov said: We also dont have enough data about men who have sex with\u2028 other men, because of high levels of stigma. The number of Russian men who were infected with HIV through\u2028 having sex with another man more than doubled to  between\u2028  and , according to official data.\u2028 Discrimination against LGBT+ people means those at risk of\u2028 HIV Aids are afraid to seek out testing and treatment, experts\u2028 say.\u2028 Russia was ranked Europes second least LGBT-friendly nation\u2028 in  by ILGA-Europe, a network of European LGBT groups.\u2028  A requirement introduced in  for some international NGOs \u2028working in Russia to register as foreign agents led to a\u2028decrease in organisations working with groups vulnerable to HIV,\u2028 said Oli Stevens, a HIV researcher based in Britain.\u2028 He said: The message was very clear, MSM \u2028 are not us, they are the other, they are not part of society\u2028 were trying to build. President Vladimir Putin has pushed traditional values, and under his rule the Orthodox Church has become an even greater influence. Boris Shapiro, professor and head of the psychology department at the Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences, said in two-thirds of Russian families, parents dont discuss sex with their children. Attempts to introduce sex education into the curriculum have failed, he told US News  World Report.  Daria Rakhmaninova, a biology teacher who organises sex education seminars in Moscow, said Russian teens know little about safe sex. She added: They dont know about birth control, they dont know about sexually transmitted diseases. Some heard about HIV, but thats about it. In the rest of the former Soviet Union, new cases of\u2028 infected drug users have fallen  per cent to , a year in a\u2028decade, while new cases of heterosexual transmission increased\u2028  per cent to almost ,.\u2028 Activists blame widespread discrimination against LGBT+\u2028 people for an eight-fold rise in transmission among men having\u2028 sex with men, to more than , cases annually.\u2028  HIV diagnoses are falling in the European Union and European\u2028 Economic Area, thanks to more widespread testing, fast treatment\u2028and the roll-out of pre-exposure prophylaxis.\u2028 Transmission rates fell  per cent between  and \u2028 among men having sex with men in the region, according to the\u2028 WHO data. \u2028Nonetheless, experts warned against complacency.\u2028 Matthew Hodson, executive director of NAM, a British\u2028HIV Aids information charity, said: If you look at the late diagnosis rates, which are still\u2028 quite high, that tells us that theres still much more to be\u2028 done. The theme of World Aids Day  is Know Your Status. This is the th anniversary of the international event. Some  million people live with HIV around the world, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV Aids. Death from Aids have fallen to the lowest level this century, with fewer than one million people dying from Aids-related illnesses last year, it said. But a funding crisis, prevention services not reaching vulnerable populations and discrimination remain worrying issues. More than million people around the world have become infected with HIV since the epidemic emerged in the s. Just under half, or .million people, have died from Aids-related illnesses.

That is what Aberdeen will be doing.“There will be plenty written about how Aberdeen will be underdogs on form and howCeltic perform they will win the trophy.“Aberdeen players will have read all that during the last week but that maybe gives them the fuel to take that underdog role to prove the critics wrong.“That is how I used to look upon it and how Aberdeen looked upon it in the seventies.”Under Miller’s captaincy the Dons dominated Scotland and conquered Europe in the early to mid-eighties.However, it was not always that way. Miller believes there are similarities between the Aberdeen team of the late seventies and McInnes’s squad now.Aberdeen are rated as - underdogs by bookmakers to triumph tomorrow and Miller was in the same situation in  when facing Celtic in the League Cup final.Celtic would go on to win the league title and Scottish Cup that season but Aberdeen denied them the treble by triumphing - at Hampden after extra-time.Miller said: “I have experienced both sides of it as I played in a number of finals in the seventies where Aberdeen were going in mostly as underdogs. That was because we hadn’t proven that we could consistently take care of beating the Old Firm in Glasgow.“We were fighting our way through to set the  for the eighties where it did become routine for the players to get to finals and win them.“Aberdeen now find themselves in that same position.“However, they can look back to the Scottish Cup final of two seasons agoin particular where they were so close to overturning Celtic and winning that trophy.“They can take confidence from that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"download your dons mask here ahead of betfred cup final","story":"Every day this week we#ve featured people wearing our cut-out-and-keep Dons mask.If you#ve yet to get yours, either from Pittodrie with your ticket, or missed it inside last Saturday#s Evening Express, you can now download yours right here. vw, px\"  Click the download here link above to save the mask as a pdf.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting.

It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13662436.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS168584632.jpg","title":"ayrshire sands mark 30 years","story":"NewsAyrshire SANDS mark  years of support and prepare for Christmas bauble serviceThe voluntary group has been offering an invaluable support network to bereaved parents across the county for three decades.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsSANDS team Marion Boyd, Jenner Stamp, Sarah Spiers and Alison McNeil \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThat they are needed at all is a matter of huge regret. But to those within Ayrshire SANDS, a common bond and desire to unite burns bright. Behind this voluntary group for bereaved parents lies many a heartbreaking story. The Stillbirth and Neonatal Death organisation is there, in the first instance, to reach out to those in desperate pain. As a support network, mums and dads who have been in the darkest of places are often the very people best placed to act as rocks for those perishing behind them. But back in , when the Ayrshire branch of this inspiring group formed, few could have imagined the size of their task  years on. Local chair, Marion Boyd, explains: “Our first meeting had only a handful of parents and the whole topic of losing a baby was very taboo. “Thankfully the world has changed a lot since then, and people have become far more open about their loss. “But there’s no doubt that back then, you were not encouraged to speak about it.” For newly grieving mums like Marion, having a place to turn was not in the script of the s. And her experience – along with those of many others – has helped drive the st century changes to hospital support.  Marion, , said: “I had to share a room with another mum who had just given birth. “Watching her push her baby around and hear the cries of a newborn was heartbreaking. “But that was the reality back in those days. “It was almost like you had to dust yourself down and get back to normal as soon as possible. “Then there were the people who wouldn’t know what to say to you...so they’d maybe say nothing at all.” Marion and fellow committee members in the Ayrshire branch of the SANDS group are among Britain’s longest serving. Along with fellow parents, they have raised thousands during the intervening three decades and made friends through their grief. New facilities, latterly built at the Ayrshire maternity unit in Crosshouse, now give newly grieving parents their own space – with SANDS instrumental in their set-up. Treasurer Alison McNeil, , said: “Each of us has our own personal story which brought us together, and obviously they are very sad. “But through the years a special bond has grown between so many of the parents here. “Some of us have become friends for le and we’re just glad we can be here to offer support to others now. “But one stillbirth or neonatal death is one too many and it’s a sad reality that our group continues to grow like it does.” From the handful that began the journey in , so many more have passed through the hands of Ayrshire SANDS since then. And on Sunday, hundreds will attend the group’s annual bauble service at Prestwick’s St Nicholas Church. And such is the growing need for the team, they even have their own social media officer. Mum Sarah Speirs, , added: “The best thing is that nobody will judge you. “Ultimately, the only person who can truly understand what it’s like to lose a child is another parent who’s experienced the same thing.” And Marion said: “We were very keen from the outset that we had NHS involvement in the group. “We have an office on site at Crosshouse and work closely with midwives. “Perhaps they could have been wary of us at first, thinking that some parents would want to criticise them. “But they quickly realised that we are all here for the same thing and it’s a relationship that has worked very well. “Ideally the need for our group wouldn’t be there at all, but we’re just glad it can do some good.” •Parents wishing to attend Sunday’s service can bring their own bauble to hang on the Christmas tree.

Whilst providing a first-class service to her clients and the long hours spent in the office, Margo manages to achieve the perfect work-le balance for her family. This is one of the many reasons that she is one of just three finalists for Solicitor of the Year at the Law Awards of Scotland . The ceremony is this Thursdayat the Hilton in Glasgow. Growing up on the family farm in Maybole, Margo has been involved in agriculture since a young age and knew that her career path would lead her into the agricultural industry. Starting her legal career in the city, Margo worked at MacLay, Murray and Spens in Glasgow before moving closer to home at Howat’s Associates in Mauchline, to spend more time with her husband and two sons. Margo then moved to become a Partner at Lockharts in Ayr, and now heads up their Agricultural and Estates Team. Margo was nominated by one of her long-standing clients and will be attending the Awards. Her firm Lockharts are presently rebranding their office and operation at Beresford Terrace. Peter Lockhart told the Post: “The Partners and staff are proud of Margo. This is particularly so, given the two other finalists are high profile City Centre Lawyers.

It follows a kne attacker plunging terror through the health network at the Ailsa Hospital. The wooly-hatted suspect remains at large after escaping past CCTV cameras switched off for  years. Community worker Donna Maxwell, , was stabbed en route to her car on Thursday morning. Now the Post can reveal cameras are also out of order at Girvan Community Hospital – a building shared by the town’s police. Police are still hunting the Ailsa suspect, understood to be a patient at the unit. But they have been forced to launch a desperate appeal for dashcam footage caught on nearby motors. The frantic search has failed to produce a result – despite the alleged culprit being known to Ailsa staff.  One NHS source told the Post: “The woman who did this is no stranger to staff at the hospital. “She had requested to speak to a particular person on Thursday and was told they weren’t there. “That seemed to agitate her and when she got outside she carried out this random attack in the car park. “Luckily she didn’t get any of Donna’s vital organs or this could have been a whole lot worse.” Mum-of-one, Donna, of Irvine, is believed to have stumbled back into the Ailsa after the attack. She was transferred to nearby Ayr Hospital for treatment. Both the Ailsa and Ayr Hospital were put on lockdown as police dog teams raced to the scene and a force chopper circled the skies. And despite an arrest on an “unrelated matter” being made later that night, police admitted on Tuesday the suspect had not been caught. A force spokeswoman said: “There has been no arrest and inquiries are ongoing.” Donna, who was released from hospital on Friday, is now recovering at home.  Husband Tom, , said: “She is very tired and sore. Everything is a bit raw at the moment. “We have been asked by the police not to say anything about what happened or make any comment.” Now a furious union claims staff and patients have been “misled” by NHS bosses over cameras being turned off. UNISON President Gordon McKay, who worked at Ailsa Hospital for many years, said: “Our first thoughts are for the member of staff and her family. “It is shocking that someone who is dedicated to providing high-quality healthcare to the people of Scotland should be attacked at work. “In the longer term, serious questions need to be asked and answered by senior management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran over why it would appear they were leading patients, relatives and staff in the hospital to believe that CCTV was operating as a safety measure when they knew it wasn’t. “Anyone who takes a decision which misleads people about safety matters must be held to account.” When pressed by this paper, NHS chiefs insisted cameras at all of Ayrshire’s major sites were in working order. However, they were forced to concede cameras at Girvan were “working but not currently recording”. And a spokeswoman admitted: “The analogue CCTV system at Ailsa Hospital has not been operational for a number of years. “We have an ongoing review of how to make best use of CCTV across all our sites.” Scotland’s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has the hospital within her Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency. She said: “The Scottish Government has been in constant contact with NHS Ayrshire and Arran throughout recent days, and has offered any support that might be required. “The Health Resilience team has also been in touch regarding the site CCTV system. “As the MSP covering the Ayr Ailsa Hospital campus, I have contacted the management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran to seek their assurances that they’re taking all reasonable steps to protect the safety both staff and patients.” Police say the suspect is about ft in to ft in tall and aged -.

Scores of jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. Senior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.  Staff have been given the stark warning by outgoing Principal, Heather Dunk. It comes as the college leaks cash on a costly PFI deal for its campus at Kilwinning. A source said: “Mrs Dunk announced to staff that the college will run out of money in a few short years. “She blamed this entirely on the funding council, the Scottish Government and the PFI at Kilwinning. “In a blatant attempt to essentially threaten staff against pursuing the cost-of-living pay rise, she made clear that at least  full time jobs would need to go to pay to keep the college afloat.” The warning comes as Mrs Dunk prepares to step down in the Spring. And a row has engulfed management as they prepare to appoint her successor. We told last week how the recruitment agency leading the search includes the we of college chair, Willie Mackie. A College spokesman said: “The Principal recently met with all staff to provide an update regarding the financial challenges facing the college due to increased staff costs arising from national bargaining and the excessive costs of the PfI campus in Kilwinning. “The College is working with the Scottish Funding Council to find a solution to the dficult financial position, however,additional funding is not available, the outcome may be the loss of jobs to reduce expenditure. “The Principal continues to update the trade unions, the student association and staff on a regular basis to ensure openness and transparency. “All staff are aware of the challenges the Colleges faces and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, wants to see the college backed by the Scottish Government until the end of its PFI contract. But he said: “Unfortunately, the response I have so far received from the Scottish Government to this request has been negative. “But I will continue to argue the case for additional funding to be allocated to the College in order that their ongoing commitments can be met and the loss of staff avoided.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"famous tower blocks almost certain","story":"NewsFamous tower blocks almost certain to be flattenedThe trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .ShareByStephen Houston:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe only towers in South Ayrshire are doomed \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s famous tower blocks are almost certainly to be flattened after a repair bill landed for up to pound MILLION of work. The astonishing figure - which works out at pound, for each flat - is being seen as hopeless to fund. The trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .   Their destruction will mean the loss of  one-bedroom flats and tenants will have to be farmed out to new homes. An insider at owners South Ayrshire Council said: “The price is too high and unless there is a money miracle, they will come down. “Officials have been taken aback at how much money they need. To save them would be financially ridiculous.” Ironically the council has already sanctioned pound million worth of initial work which has already begun. Housing staff say that to build a brand new flat either on the same riverside site or where in the area is just pound,. Each of the blocks has  homes and  have been deliberately left empty as the scale of repair emerged. One-to-one consultation is to take place with the tenants - most of whom are elderly - over the next six months. Councillors heard about the state of the “essential and advisable” works at a meeting yesterday . These include the removal of the external cladding, existing timber and aluminium windows, and pitched roof covering new insulated render system full rewiring new heating and hot water systems upgrading the sprinkler system and upgrading passenger lts. One long-time tenant told the Post: “If it is going to cost about pound, to build a new flat for me to rent, I have a money saving plan. “Give me pound, and I’ll buy my own we place in Ayr. Job done.” If repairs were sanctioned tenants would need to be decanted for a year. Housing boss Donald Gillies said: “As we consider what happens next with the high flats in Ayr, our tenants will continue to be our focus at all times. That’s why we’re asking councillors to approve a formal consultation where we can sit down on an inidual basis with each and every one of our tenants in Riverside Place and discuss their specic needs and preferences. “If Councillors agree, we’re also seeking approval to appoint two dedicated officers to lead on the consultation and engagement exercise, which would get underway in the new year with a further report to Councillors in June. “It would only be then that any decision on the future of the flats would be taken and tenants would be involved in discussions every step of the way.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13663409.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_231118pets_04JPG.jpg","title":"hopping mad mauchline miss doolittle","story":"NewsHopping mad Mauchline Miss Doolittle issues Christmas pleaPoppy Wyllie owns a whopping  bunnies so she knows a thing or two about caring for them.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsPoppy with guinea pals Ginny and Delilah and cabbage-eating rabbit Jasper. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hopping mad seven-year-old is warning others that rabbits are pets for le and not just Christmas.

It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"50k-boost-for-museum-from-festival-of-speed","story":"MORE than pound, has been donated to a Borders museum by organisers of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.And a

And he pulled out these two chin bars onto the stage in front of the audience and said: lsquoWersquore going to do a chin contest.rsquoldquoSo, there I am ending up doing chins to prove myself.He pauses, thinks about that and then adds: ldquoIt wasnrsquot like solving dferential equations.True, but how did you do anyway Dolph  ldquoI did OK, actually. They cut out after . Still,I hadnrsquot been working out it would have been kind of embarrassing not to be able to do one.It is, I accept, more than possible that you havenrsquot thought about Dolph Lundgren since the s. Back in the day he was the Russian villain Ivan Drago in the Rocky movies and appeared in a loin cloth and not much  in the live-actionversion of He-Man.But that was then. Apart from the odd appearance in an Expendables sequel or two , his IMDB listing is full of what we used to call straight-to-video titles such as Puncture Wounds, Silent Trigger and Sharknado : Global Swarming.And yet suddenly Lundgren is back in fashion, with roles in two full-on, proper Hollywood movies. Right now, hersquos back in cinemas as an older Ivan Drago in the latest Rocky iteration, Creed . And next month he turns up as King Nereus in the new underwater superhero movie Aquaman next month.He wasnrsquot sure about taking a role in the former. ldquoI didnrsquot want to mess with that character, he says. ldquoItrsquos a bit of an iconic character and I did it many many years ago.ldquoBut the script turned out to be very good and it uses how Irsquove aged and how the franchise has changed and I thought it was a good marriage.And the result is very dferent from the original movies. ldquoYes it is. Both films are directed by young African-American directors. So, Itrsquos more more urban, itrsquos younger itrsquos very modern, very character driven. I like that.With these roles, it feels, he admits, like hersquos been given another chance. ldquoIrsquove done a lot of work on myself and Irsquom trying to put out a lot of good energy out into the universe. And yeah, maybe the energy is bouncing back now, and I get a chance to express myself a little bit. Still in the action adventure realm, but with good directors and more interesting characters.ldquoIt feels exciting. It could be the beginning of a nice second act.Lundgren is  now. He lives in Los Angeles these days. That might not surprise you given the way he talks. But hersquos smarter ndash intellectually and emotionally ndash than his image might suggest.He has just been on a trip to London to take his youngest daughter to boarding school there. But when we talk he is still in Sweden, his homeland. A good place, perhaps, for him to take stock of the first act of his le. The days growing up under the shadow of an abusive father, his wild days with Grace Jones and an unexpected movie stardom that was not what he had been planning. Fame, fatherhood, orce, therapy. Theyrsquore all part of the story.Talking about all of this Lundgren makes for entertaining, wryly amusing company. He doesnrsquot shy away from the damage wrought on him and by him, but he has a kind of Calornian hippy laissez faire attitude to it all now.It is fair to say that, back when he first became a star, some of us never really looked beyond the muscles. To be honest, it was something of a revelation to me to read Grace Jonesrsquos autobiography and learn that before they met Lundgren had a degree and a masterrsquos in chemical engineering and had won a Fulbright scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. A road not taken in the end.Therersquos a mind there that has been ignored by most of us. ldquoHah, yeah, it gets ignored a lot, he laughs.ldquoI think I have suffered from that inner confusion, he adds. ldquoDid I do the right thing  Why do people look at me in a certain way  And then, of course, you look at Ivan Drago. As a character hersquos a guy in red shorts who beats people up. You look at He-Man. His outfit is the size of a stamp. He carries a huge sword and he chops people up. I understand why people look at me in a certain way.ldquoI look back now at what I looked like when I was that age and Irsquom a little bit amazed. Wow, I look unreal. And this was before Photoshop.ldquoPeople couldnrsquot imagine that guy was a Fulbright scholar and I understand. I couldnrsquot have imagined it either.Who was that young science student  A boy whose le had been shaped by his father in many ways.Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren was an engineer who had also spent time in the military. You can see the influence of the father on the sonrsquos choices. Perhaps in the circumstances that is not a surprise.ldquoHe was a very strong man. He was a big guy. He was an officer and a gentleman in some ways, Lundgren says. ldquoHe was a snappy dresser. He was a scholar.ldquoAnd he also had a really dark side.The stain of that is something Lundgren himself has been dealing with all his le. Dealing with mental and physical abuse.ldquoWhen he got older, when the dark forces came, he took it out on me and my mom. He beat me a lot. And my mom too.He understands things more now, he says. His father had been abused as a child himself. ldquoAs a young boy you try to handle that. I had a lot of trauma. I still have some.The teenage Lundgren channelled some of his rage into boxing and martial arts and later acting. ldquoBut like somebody said, you hijack the emotion and you take it and use it. I donrsquot react from that place, which I did a lot in the past.Well, yes. The fact is that his fatherrsquos violence shaped much of his le for years, decades even. ldquoI was angry with him and I had plans to take revenge physically on him, Lundgren admits. ldquoBut I never carried those through because it just didnrsquot make any sense and by the time I was a martial artist I had other values of respect and a little more wisdom when it came to violence.ldquoI forgave him early on and I still forgive him, and I meditate for what he did.He goes off at a tangent for a moment. ldquoI think when you look at somebody who bumps into you or cuts you off in LA traffic itrsquos easy to say lsquohey, F you, man.rsquoldquoYou think you want to kill that person. You donrsquot even know them.ldquoAnd then, when I take a deep breath, I realise: lsquoHang on a second, thatrsquos why we have wars, thatrsquos why young men and young women are being blown to pieces all over the place because people donrsquot take time and take a breath and say: lsquowell, maybe it wasnrsquot that guyrsquos fault. Maybe he had a bad day. And he wasnrsquot doing it to me. It wasnrsquot personal.He is candid when he talks about the impact his fatherrsquos behaviour had on his own when he himself became a father with his now ex-we Anette Qviberg. Because what does it mean when an abusive man is your paternal role model ldquoYeah, it was dficult for me. Luckily, I had two daughters. Therersquos no sense of competition. But, yeah, I didnrsquot handle it well. I mean. I was always loving to them. I never beat them or anything.ldquoBut I did abuse myself. I was drinking too much. I was absent a lot early on in their upbringing and it was because I was dealing with my own demons.ldquoBut at some point, about  years ago I started doing therapy and I started meditating I became wiser about what had happened, and I went back to them and I spoke to them and also my ex-we and I asked for forgiveness. I told them about my dad and they started crying.ldquoNow they understand that, yes, a big strong guy like their dad can make mistakes too. You can ask for forgiveness for things yoursquove done.Of course, before Lundgren even became a father you also need to factor in fame and success into the mix. Unexpected fame it must be said. ldquoI donrsquot know why it happened that quickly, but it did.Lundgren met Grace Jones in Australia and soon was accompanying her to Studio , hanging out with Andy Warhol and trying out for a role in the James Bond movie A View to a Kill because his girlfriend already had a role in it. Next thing he knew he was cast in Rocky IV as Ivan ldquoI must break you Drago.ldquoSomebody said: lsquoYou got famous overnight.rsquo And I said lsquoNo, I got famous in  minutes. The movie lasted  minutes. When I walked in nobody cared about me. They were taking pictures of Grace Jones and trying to get me out of the way, so I wouldnrsquot block the view.ldquoAnd then as I was coming out people were taking pictures of me and it took me years to get over that. Itrsquos not like Irsquod been an actor waiting tables dreaming of success. Irsquod been at MIT in Boston a year and a half before that deciding to give up my scholarship.At the time his le was one of sex, drugs and disco in the days before Aids started cutting swathes through the people he knew. Hersquos talked before of Jonesrsquos appetites: for drugs and group sex. The partying lestyle led to inevitable clashes with Sylvester Stallone who was acting and directing Rocky IV and wanted his co-star to turn up early and bright-eyed .Lundgren was being pulled in two directions and in the end his relationship with Jones was pulled apart.That said, Jones has nothing but good things to say about Lundgren in her  memoir. In fact, therersquos a line in it, I remind him, where she writes: ldquoI would say Dolph saved my le.ldquoShit, really  I havenrsquot read it. Wow. Thatrsquos beautul, he says. ldquoYou know, I didnrsquot think I was in it.ldquoWhy did I save her le  Well, I know what happened was she met this young man, a young student karate fighter in Australia, and two years later he was a movie star. I donrsquot know why it happened so quickly, but it did. It put a lot of strain on the relationship and we broke up a year later.ldquoI think she suffered a lot for that. And I didnrsquot know how to save it. I wasnrsquot smart enough and it fell apart and at that point she went through a lot of problems. And I did help her a few times when she was in trouble.These days Dolph Lundgren might start the day with meditation and some cardio before breakfast and maybe weights later in the day. Hersquos older now. He had hip surgery in June and hersquos doing physio for that too.ldquoI donrsquot push myself physically the way I used to do. Apart from that I try to eat every four hours, so I donrsquot snack too much. Ifrsquo Irsquom filming Irsquom on set,not I try to chill out with my two daughters.I wonder what his definition of masculinity is now  What, Dolph, should a man be  ldquoA man  Oh boy. Well, I think itrsquos a number of things. Hersquos certainly an inidual who has to be strong and protective and caring about the people around him and at the same time he has to be loving and understanding and compassionate and, I think, forgiving. Otherwise, you canrsquot forgive other people. You end up fighting all the time and thatrsquos dangerous for yourself and for the world.And yet the movies ndash and letrsquos be honest, his movies ndash prefer the fighting to the forgiving. ldquoYeah, yoursquore right. A lot of films Irsquove been in portray violence and revenge in a sort of cartoonish way where itrsquos portrayed as something you have to do and there are no consequences to it. No negative consequences.ldquoBut both of the films Irsquove got coming out this year, Aquaman and Creed  Irsquove been lucky. I was fortunate enough to play characters who are dealing with that situation, with that struggle within. Both Drago and the king I play in Aquaman are asking: lsquoShould I forgive  Should I break the cycle of violence rsquo And I think both characters make the right choice.ldquoI tried to hone in on that part of the characters because thatrsquos how I look at le now.Creed  is in cinemas now. Aquaman goes on general release on December ."},{"url":null,"title":"retire-from-what-why-paul-mccartney-keeps-on-going","story":"In the last  months, Elton John, Ozzy Osbourne, Neil Diamond, Kiss and the grizzled remnants of Lynyrd Skynyrd have announced end-of-the-road tours.

And now here he is hitting the boards once again, maintaining the kind of pace a man half his age would do well to muster.Rumours persist of a headline-grabbing appearance at Glastonbury next year. His Scottish gig comes  years after the Beatles first played in Glasgow at the Odeon and his first since Hampden in , but oddly it will be only his ninth concert appearance overall in a city he once name-checked in the song Helen Wheels.McCartney has been famous at an unimaginable level longer than nearly anyone  alive. To put an astonishing le into context, he wrote Yesterday, the worldrsquos most covered song, in  when he was just  years of age. He was a Fab Fab Four millionaire by the time he was  at a time when the Treasury was trousering  old pennies from every pound he earned and is today unchallenged as the worldrsquos richest musician with a fortune estimated to be not far south of a billion pounds.The legacy of his songwriting alliance with Lennon continues to shimmer down the decades Deezer last week revealed more people under the age of  currently stream Beatles tracks than those who would have been around in their Sixties pomp. And the legacy of his prodigious post-Beatles output with Wings and his solo output garners more plaudits as the years tick down.There have, though, been plenty of tears in the rain. He was scarred by the death of his mum Mary ndash the hymn-like subject of Let It Be - from breast cancer when he was just . He slipped into a post-Beatles funk at his Argyle farm on the Mull of Kintyre before being pulled out of the blackness by his we Linda.Lennonrsquos dreadful assassination at the hands of a deranged fan in  saw McCartney retreat to the margins ndash he turned his back on touring for nine years. His -year marriage to Linda was tragically ended by cancer in  before the same illness claimed the le of fellow Beatle George Harrison three years later.Wersquoll gloss over the mis-step of his subsequent marriage to the former model Heather Mills and the toxic ndash and expensive - aftermath that was played out so dramatically in the orce courts. Today, McCartney is happily married to third we Nancy Shevell, a publicity-shy American who provides the reassuring comfort blanket for a man who has never been without a female companion since the age of .He takes enormous pride in his four children ndash the youngest from his marriage to Mills - and an extended family that also includes eight grandchildren. Yet there remains a sense that McCartney has been underestimated by history, a man who, despite his undoubted musical genius, is in his own way as insecure and vulnerable as Lennon was his seeming total opposite.Music continues to nurture and nourish his le. But his most recent work has caught a man looking wistfully in the mirror and perhaps reading the runes of his own mortality. And this sombre self-examination is played out in the first track on his latest album, his voice frail and aged. On ldquoYesterday, he sounded like a wounded youth. On ldquoI Donrsquot Know, he naturally sounds like an older man, his vocals now able to convey sadness not as an effect but as a fact.His voice was once one of musicrsquos most powerful instruments, as potent in its own way as Jimmy Pagersquos guitar or Clarence Clemonsrsquo saxophone. But the debacle of his sub-par performances at the closing ceremony for the  Olympics and the Queenrsquos Diamond Jubilee the same year handed critics a gilt-edged cudgel. The court of public opinion also delivered a damning verdict.McCartneyrsquos response was simply to circle the wagons behind the band that has been the mainstay of his live shows for almost  years and carry on regardless. The high notes are unquestionably harder to hit but he remains dedicated to his craft, in and outside the studio.His  collaboration with Kanye West and Rihanna on the song FourFiveSeconds may have mortied traditional fans but it gained him kudos with a new audience. These days more than any other McCartney seems to take shelter in the solace of live shows, asthe stage still offers an escape route from lersquos problems. On another Egypt Station track, he wistfully talks about having been ldquobroken in so many places, held together by a sea of faces.Which brings us to an inevitable question  Is this tour the full stop on Paul McCartneyrsquos performing career and will Decemberrsquos show at the Hydro mark his farewell to his Scottish fans  Wersquove been here before, of course. Final show. Final encore. Final bow.But this time feels like the end of a long and winding road, especially given the eight years that have elapsed since his last Scottish concert. Even for rock stars, the fat lady eventually has to have the final word. Yesterday really did come suddenly.Paul McCartney plays the SSE Hydro in Glasgow on December "},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-15-best-cosy-coffee-shops","story":".

Irsquoll only be told that when I eventually make it to the long, low metal-topped counter through a sardine can of sprawling, leaning, chatting, arm-on-each-otherrsquos-shoulders customers.Then while ordering Irsquoll ask the man where all these people are originally from and hersquoll say mainly Syria, but all over really, and theyrsquore talking Arabic.Ours will be a brief conversation because hersquos busy and because all the time I am being gently pushed, slightly bumped, harmlessly nudged back down the counter by the surge of clippered-side-shed hairstyles with gelled-back qufs.My slow journey there had been enhanced though, by watching pirouetting chickens dance, bubble and brown on burners so hot I can feel them pleasantly toast my face on this bitterly cold November night.Its not what I came in for but I have to have me some of that chicken. Served with salad, the famous Muhammara sauce from Aleppo, Saj bread and rice please.ldquoA least  minutes til theyrsquore ready mate,\" says the man switching to Glaswegian. I shake my head at the prospect of another wait and order instead the Arabic Shawarma Wrap at just over pound.What I donrsquot realise is that all the young dudes havenrsquot got their food yet and by the time theyrsquove got theirs and Irsquove got mine that rotisserie chicken will be completely ready. So I will have one of them too.Now. Of all the wonderful things that immigrants bring and have brought and will hopefully continue to bring to this city over the years, their food has surely got to rank super high up there. Look about. Itrsquos everywhere.And when you can step off a pavement in downtown Glasgow, just round the corner from St Enoch Square, and culturally anyway yoursquove stumbled into Syria from a better time and its going like a fair, well it livens up an otherwise dull Tuesday night doesnrsquot it I know what yoursquore thinking. Yoursquore thinking: a shawarma  I thought that too. Until I got mine. Juicy chicken straight from the grill, chopped, doused in sauce, wrapped tightly in the flatbread they make freshly themselves in here then the whole thing placed on another grill. And big old iron weights put on top of it. To flatten it down. To deliciously crisp that flatbread up.Itrsquos then sliced across the grain. Into surprisingly elegant finger-size bites. And served with Syrian Garlic Cream, more chilli sauce, and those sour and salty pickles that they make themselves. Outstanding.On those pickles by the way: try the Pickled Scottish Turnip. Crikey, who knew  Most dudes are having chips with their shawarmas tonight, but this dudersquos having that buttery rice, full of the flavour of cardamom.And the chicken  As good as it looked. Just-cooked, moist and sweetly tender. I wont eat it in here but take it home for the family to try, dipping torn off pieces of the Saj bread and chicken into that deep, dense Muhammara of peppers, walnuts, chilli and possibly even pomegranate.It would have been easy to walk past Lazord on a night like this without even noticing it. It looks like any one of the scores of kebab shops in the city centre. They keep the shutter down too on the side with two big tables.I probably wouldnrsquot have come in at allI hadnrsquot had a number of emails suggesting I brave the steady rush. Even then itrsquos hard to get a seat at one of the tables and simple, utilitarian and not hugely comfortable when I do.But still better to experience the Arabic Shawarama on site - to understand the crispness of the fresh flatbread, its all round juicyness. That crispness goes when its placed in a takeaway box.I know all this because of course Irsquove now been more than once. And will be back again. And probably again.Menu: Whole rotisserie chicken with that famous Aleppo Muhammara and Saj bread and those Arabic Shawarmas. What  do you need  Service: Worth the wait. Can feel like every man for himself in the surge to get served but persevere andthe counter staff get a minute theyrsquore pleasant, friendly and immensely proud of what they do. Atmosphere: Itrsquos a buzzing kebab shop with just two biggish tables, rotating chickens, flaring burners and faststreet food. I liked it. Price: Factor in the care they take over preparation and at pound for an Arabic Shawarma meal, pound for the whole chicken with Muhammara and Saj,   doesnrsquot do it justice. Food: Come for the elegant Arabic Shawarma with its dainty sections, crisped up deliciousness, juicy meats and carefully made pride.

After being promised wealth on buses, we face hardship on stilts. And after hammering warnings of No Deal to get her own way, Theresa May has invalidated No Deal by mistake.In the last week, wersquove seen the UK Government warning No Deal could lop % off GDP by  relative to our current economic trajectory. Security minister Ben Wallace said No Deal could put the country at greater risk of crime and terrorism. And Scottish Secretary David Mundell doubled down on his claim that No Deal would be ldquocatastrophic for the Union.So dire have been the worst-case scenarios that MPs have united to block No Deal. The apocalypse appears to have been cancelled.Mrs May also made the ldquonational interest her yardstick on Brexit. But in what circumstances would the national interest be best served by No Deal  How could she argue it would be in the national interest to enter recession, choke the ports, disrupt the food supply chain, upend industry, risk social unrest, and jeopardise her precious Union, as her own cabinet has warned She has killed off her bogeyman. Instead of No Deal warnings making it more likely MPs will back her deal, it has made them more likely to reject it, as they no longer feel a chaotic exit hanging over them.They now reckon they have more space to explore other options - a softer Norway-style Brexit with single market and customs union membership is the current favourite, or a Peoplersquos Vote, the option increasingly favoured by Labour.Some politicians point out that, although Mrs May and the EU say the current deal is the only one on offer, it is more accurate to say it is the only negotiated deal. That doesnrsquot mean itrsquos the only option. Off-the-shelf plans, such as EFTA membership, are out there too.Nicola Sturgeon always said it was a ldquo choice between Mrs Mayrsquos deal and No Deal, and Mrs May and cabinet have proved it. Brexit is rich with unintended consequences.Another unintended consequence applies to Ms Sturgeon. The First Minister recently announced her MPs would vote in favour of a Peoplersquos Votegiven the chance. It was not a universally popular idea.Pete Wishart, the longest serving SNP MP, warned it could work against the independence cause, setting a precedent that could see Unionists demand a re-run of a referendum ending in a Yes vote.Alex Salmond raised the same point on his TV show last month.Irsquom not sure about this argument. The SNP conceded the principle that referendums can be rerun as soon as it lost the  vote. ldquoThe dream shall never die, as Mr Salmond said in his resignation. Then Ms Sturgeon called a second referendum in March  over Brexit to reverse the No vote.The argument seems more about timing than principle about how long to wait before voters will put up with another referendum.But there is a more pressing aspect to Ms Sturgeon supporting a Peoplersquos Vote. If her MPs back it, they will be voting against another independence referendum. Not directly, of course. But the former would surely preclude the latter.Imagine the Prime Minister is defeated on December  and the upshot, after much wailing and gnashing of dentistry, is that MPs decide to palm the mess off onto you and me. Sorry, I mean trust the people to decide what to do next. This would not be a speedy process.The EU would have to agree to extend the Article  process by a year or more to put Brexit on ice. Another referendum means a bespoke Bill going through Westminster. The last one took seven months. A second referendum Bill would be resisted at every turn by apoplectic Brexiteers. There would be a furious debate about what would be on the ballot paper.Would it be a choice between Leave and Remain again  Or a multiple choice  Perhaps the UK governmentrsquos deal versus a dferent deal , staying in the EU or a sod-it No Deal.If it was first-past-the-post, the winner would almost certainly get less than the % that gave Leave victory in . Imagine the stink that would cause. If it was decided by proportional representation, transfers might see most peoplersquos second choice come out on top. That doesnrsquot sound like a recipe for clarity and contentment either.The Electoral Commission would need weeks to mull it over. There would then be another four months of campaigning, and a potentially long and messy aftermath.The process could be doubly confused by a Tory leadership contest and a winner shting the government position mid-stream.This would all take time, time Ms Sturgeon doesnrsquot haveshe wants a second referendum before her ldquocast-iron mandate runs out in .As Irsquove written before, the First Minister has to make a call on Indyref by mid-it is happen in this parliament, because of legislation and campaign time. Butthere was a second EU vote she would have to wait till that was over, and by then it would be too late.She canrsquot have two referendums running at once. That would be a dogrsquos dinner. But nor can she have one after the other because therersquos not enough time for both by .The Scottish Tories claimed this week that Ms Sturgeon is backing a Peoplersquos Vote to cause chaos and boost the prospects of the Yes movement. But Irsquod say a Peoplersquos Vote is more likely to stall the Yes movement, at least for a few years.Faced with this choice between two referendums, I wonder how SNP MPs will vote in the end."},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick-under-pressure-after-advertising-jobs-below-real-living-wage","story":"But five years on, Glasgow Prestwick Airport is under fresh pressure after it emerged it is still advertising jobs which fail to pay the real living wage, despite Nicola Sturgeon urging all employers to do so.Opponents have now accused Ms Sturgeon of ldquorank hypocrisy after she criticised the Ministry of Defence for paying more than  civilian staff less than the living wage during First Ministerrsquos Questions on Thursday.She said: ldquoThe MoD and all Government agencies should pay the real living wage.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare.

He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin.

He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: Libya trade envoy role ‘very interesting’Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"four generations during four decades","story":"JOHN Paul II Youth Club in Ardoyne was founded in  amidst violence that would mark the year as one of the bloodiest of the recent conflict.The youth club’s first home was in a disused shop on Herbert Street, just yards from where a number of nationalist were burnt out of their homes just a few years earlier.Jacqui Maguire, a senior youth worker at John Paul II, was just nine years old when she attended the club’s first ever event on Halloween night in its formative year, and has been involved with the club ever since.Reflecting on those early days, Jacqui recalled how, in the hardest of times, local people rallied to provide a safe haven for young people who needed refuge from regular rioting and shootings on the nearby Crumlin Road.“The kids needed social interaction, but they were getting out of school and then going into the house because of the shooting and the rioting,” she explained.“There was an old shop that they cleared out and used for discos and wee parties.“The word went about that there was a youth club opening and everybody came from everywhere. In the beginning it was just used as a place for the kids in the street to play, but it just got bigger and bigger.“It was used as a nursery and mothers would meet there at night-time. It was like a social club rather than a youth club.“At the time Mr McLaughlin in St Gabriel’s said there werelads at the school who needed apprenticeships, so he would have brought them down and they were doing a bit bricklaying and plumbing and cleaned up the building.”Despite its less-than-humble beginnings, Jacqui’s early memories of the youth club are happy ones of a community that did its best in dficult circumstances. She recalls discos in Herbert Street, sports competitions and – despite it being the height of the Troubles – cross-community trips away. It was also those formative years that set Jacqui on the path to youth work. “Every night there was something dferent going on,” she recalled.“We also went on cross community trips, and we went to Cork with Cedar Lodge Youth Club. We used to go to Cork in the week of July. Later on we would have gone to Donegal. It was really a way to keep us off the streets.”She continued: “The club got us to do wee junior committees, got us to volunteer and help the young ones, and it stopped us being out there causing trouble. That’s the way we run this club as well. There are all dferent age groups that help with the younger ones. It’s called peer leading now, but it wouldn’t have been called that in those days.”Moving from an old disused shop to two burnt-out houses in the area that were renovated, the youth club eventually got its own purpose built building, which was opened by Liverpool and Ireland player Steve Heighway in . That came after local people, including Jacqui’s father Owen Maguire, and her late mother Bridie Maguire, lobbied the then Secretary of State, Lord Melchett, to obtain £, in funding for the club’s new home.While kids with few other facilities flocked to John Paul II Youth Club in its early days, the club has only grown since then. Two years ago a new extension was built at the club and plans are already under way to build a new amphitheatre and all-purpose sports pitch in early .John Paul II Youth Club has been an integral part of the lives of many people in Ardoyne. Jacqui represents just one of four generations of her family who are currently involved with the club and said its growth is a real source of pride to her.“It’s hard to believe that a group of women way back in the s even knew about social policy, or knew how to take those steps to build a club,” she said.“I will also say that it has been the members and the community that have been the backbone of the club. We could see what it did for us and we want to make sure pass that on to the next generation and the generations after that.“It’s a safe haven for the kids. Our young people know they can come in and there is enough staff of dferent ages and dferent levels for them to work with them. Young people will have particular staff that they will really gel with. We have a lot of programmes, a lot of personal development, a lot of buddy programmes, but it doesn’t all have to be high-flying – sometimes it can just be sitting down with somebody to talk.”Like all community groups, John Paul II Youth Club has had its challenges, particularly in the area of funding. However, volunteer hours, care and hard work from staff members combine to keep the club open six days a week. For the young people, the outcome is better social lives, learning opportunities, and the instilling of a strong set of values amongst which empathy is to the fore.“Our motto is sharing is caring,” Jacqui said.“They learn acceptance and understanding of others. It doesn’t matter who they are or what they are – you respect them. It doesn’t matter what anybody’s issues are, you always give them a second chance, because we can all mess up first chances.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"storm diana set to batter the north","story":"THE tail end of Storm Diana is set to sweep across the north todaywith strong winds of up to mph in some places.A yellow warning has been put in place by the Met Office from am to midnight.The warning adds that some delays to public transport are likely and some journey times could take longer.

Corbyn should put the national interest before party advantagePaul Gosling: Its misguided for advocates of Irish unity to call for border poll without having strategy to deal with yes vote The South Antrim MLA also called on the UK and Irish governments to begin preparations for an Irish unity referendum.Mr Kearney said that the Good Friday Agreement established a democratic option for creating a united Ireland and the time had come for it to be fully implemented.He also criticised both the UK and Irish governments for their handling of the political situation in Northern Ireland in recent years.Northern Ireland has been without an Executive since January  when former deputy First Minister, the late Martin McGuinness resigned over the RHI scandal and equality issues.Theresa Mays government currently rely on the DUPs ten MPs to support their legislation through a confidence and supply agreement.Mr Kearney said that Brexit had brought the issue of Irish unity into focus.\"Both

twenty years on from the signing of the Good Friday Agreement the contradictions of partition have been brought sharply into focus again as a result of the political crisis in the north, the continued denial of citizens rights by political unionism, and opposition to rights based political institutions.\"The catastrophe of Brexit has deepened these contradictions.\"The South Antrim MLA said that the DUP-Tory deal risked Northern Ireland going backwards.\"The majority will of citizens in the north to remain in the European Union has been made subordinate to a wreckers charter being driven by right wing Tories and their allies in the DUP and political unionism,\" Mr Kearney said.\"Brexit represents the most extreme form of vandalism against the island’s economy and citizens rights.\"There is a real risk that  years of progress could be squandered due to the toxic alliance between the British Tories and DUP.\"Mr Kearney said it was time that both governments prepare for a unity poll as

BelfastBrexit survey: Have your say and you could win a £ Amazon voucher UUP leader Robin Swann said his party was prepared to look at all the alternatives to Theresa Mays \"unacceptable\" current deal but he stressed that any solution must be \"UK-wide\".Sinn Fein said the DUP couldnt negotiate their own agreement and there already was a Brexit deal on the table. NI boss is called ‘Tory cow’ for May support Speaking to BBC Radio s Today programme yesterday, Mrs Foster said she would not support calls for a second Brexit referendum, as the UK had already voted to leave and \"we respect that\". Repeating the DUPs opposition to Mrs Mays deal, she urged the Prime Minister to \"not waste time\" on it and instead look for a better solution to the border question.She hinted thatthe current Withdrawal Agreement failed to get through the House of Commons, her party could be open to a Norway plus style arrangement, where the whole of the UK stayed in the customs union until an agreement with the EU is reached on future trading relations. Would membership of the EEA work  Ms Foster said the DUPs \"one red line\" was to make sure Northern Ireland was not dferentiated from the rest of the UK in terms of customs and was \"not prescriptive\" about other potential options on the future relationship with the EU.But a Norway plus-style arrangement has been rejected by the TUV leader.Mr Allister told the Belfast : \"It would retain us fully within the EU single market, subject to all Brussels-made rules - adjudicated by the European Court of Justice - and maintain free movement of labour and require ongoing payments to the EU. That is not Brexit. Brexit: Ulster Farmers Union remain amenable to alternate Withdrawal Agreement proposal \"But for us it would be worse, because the Norway plus that is being talked about would additionally keep Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU - completing the repudiation of the Brexit that was voted for. Thus, the backstop would essentially still apply.\"Mr Allister continued: \"The core of the backstop is that Northern Ireland alone remains part of the customs territory of the EU.\"With the EU likely to only agree a Norway-style deal which had this add-on, it would leave us incarcerated in the EU in perpetuity.\"The UUP did not appear to rule out a Norway plus style arrangement. Mr Swann said: \"The Ulster Unionist Party cannot give our support to the Withdrawal Agreement and its disastrous backstop. However, we will look at every option and assess its merits - but the bottom line for the Ulster Unionist Party is that any solution must be UK-wide in its entirety.\"Sinn Fein MLA Mairtin O Muilleoir said: \"There already is a deal on the table - its not perfect but it avoids physical infrastructure on the border.\"The DUP cannot negotiate their own deal. Nor can they back a deal that isnt there.\"The EU has recognised that a unique solution is needed for the north because of our historical and geographical concerns. The backstop recognises that - that must be maintained.\"Mrs Foster told Radio  that Mrs Mays deal would see Northern Ireland \"erge off from the United Kingdom\" and she urged the Prime Minister to \"look for a better deal\" that \"takes back control of our money, of our borders and of our laws\".The DUP leader said: \"All the things that made us vote for Brexit are the things that are going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\"Reiterating that the DUPs  MPs would not back the Withdrawal Agreement on December , Mrs Foster said it would create a \"huge democratic deficit\" in Northern Ireland.Mrs May yesterday rejected a suggestion that the failure to get a deal with the EU would see the UK stuck with the Northern Ireland backstop plan permanently.She was responding to Andrew Murrison, the Tory MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who compared it to a \"post-war pre-fab\".He said: \"Its sold as temporary, its built to last, and its likely to outlive us all.\"However, the PM dismissed his comments and told the House of Commons Liaison Committee it would only ever be a temporary solution.She added: \"Neither side thinks the backstop is a good place to be.\"Mrs May admitted that it would not be possible for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it, though.

This led to them coming up with “minimalist” language that acknowledges growing migrant flows and the importance of shared efforts to support refugees and solve the problems that drive them to flee.The statement also shows a commitment to a “rules-based international order,” despite Mr Trump’s rejection of many of those rules.“There were moments when we thought all was lost,” one European official said, “moments when we spent two hours on one sentence.”Perhaps surprisingly, one country seen as particularly constructive was Russia, the officials added.Despite tensions over its military actions on Ukraine and political interference abroad, Russia supports international efforts on trade and climate.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with Russian President Vladimir Putin While a statement is not legally enforceable, the Europeans see it as proof the G is still relevant and multilateralism still works.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: “Everyone agrees that the WTO should be reformed.

The latter opened last year at a cost of poundm.ldquoSuch facilities are important in the provision of sport and recreation, especially to young people who are just starting out in their sporting activities, the council chairman continued.ldquoFacilities like the Down Leisure Centre provide a gathering place around which social activities occur. They provide a sense of pride of place and belonging that can add value to community and indeed the entire district.ldquoThe council is committed that all people in Newry, Mourne and Down enjoy good health and wellbeing via the districtrsquos community plan and that the lsquoBe Activersquo campaign is a superb way to help support this outcome.Cllr Murnin added: ldquoA healthy and active lestyle contributes positively to physical, mental and social wellbeing and as an organisation we want to encourage all our citizens to be active every day.Council officials are delighted with the new centre and the initial reaction of the public to date.One of the key features is the teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Mains gas has also been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint. Photovoltaic cells which have been fitted on the roof help heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas.In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns it into warm air, while so-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building, with everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to builders and the councillors who supported it financially, delighted at the opening of a new chapter in the history of local leisure provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget on the ball helping families dealing with dementia  ","story":"BALLYGALGET GAC has been recognised for its effort in helping people who live with dementia in an award ceremony recently.John Mitchelrsquos GAC received the award after teaming up with the Alzheimerrsquos Society to become the first GAA club to take on the Dementia Friendly programme.This award recognises the work members do to ensure everyone affected with dementia in their parish and beyond gets the support they need.Brendan Birt, a spokesperson for the club, explained that the club had been crossing every cultural and religious ide since it was founded in .He said that in that time the club had attended to the needs of everyone who live in what is a very rural part of the Ards Peninsula.ldquoWe are delighted to win this award in recognition of the work that has been done by our club and in the community, he remarked.ldquoThe first initiative of our new award-winning health and wellbeing centre was to become a dementia friendly community. We already have  trained dementia friends and that is growing.ldquoAs the first GAA club, we wanted to get involved because of the many people within our community who are living with dementia. This has raised the profile and understanding of dementia within our club and parish.Although this project is in its infancy, two dementia friendly community workshops have already been delivered creating  dementia friends, not only in Ballygalget but in the surrounding areas too.Future plans include extending the dementia friends initiative to two neighbouring GAA clubs and to hold a workshop in the local primary school.Bernadine McCrory, Country Director for Alzheimerrsquos Society, said: ldquoIt is amazing that John Mitchelrsquos GAC has won the Championing Diversity award and it is a testament to their tremendous work they do.ldquoThe level of nominations received this year was truly phenomenal and there were some exceptional stories heard at the awards ceremony.ldquoWe want everyone affected by dementia to know that whoever you are, whatever you are going through, you can turn to Alzheimerrsquos Society for support, help and advice.She added: ldquoAll the finalists and winners at the Dementia Friendly Awards have demonstrated how we can unite against dementia and support those affected by the condition..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch edge derby tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an ugly derby win in front of a large home crowd and banished a few memories from the three defeats to Banbridge last season which cost them promotion.The home side were almost at full strength, with Peter Nelson at full back, Kyle McCall ing in the front row and Johnny McPhillips sprung from the bench in the second half. Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -. Relief rather than elation from the home supporters as they made their way home.Ballynahinch Banbridge AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Chairman gives his backing to ‘green’ off road paths scheme  ","story":"A CAMPAIGN to connect Downpatrick with the Rowallane area via a series of off-road paths has secured the backing of the districtrsquos first citizen.A delegation of residents met recently with Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin to discuss extending the existing Quoile River walk towards Killyleagh. A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

A comprehensive design scheme would also have to be worked up.NI Water officials have also confirmed Saintfield is one of a number of towns across the Province which requires signicant investment to upgrade the existing infrastructure to carter for current and future demand.Rowallane politicians fear the moratorium on new development in Saintfield could potentially be in place for two years and have urged senior NI Water officials to do all they can to expedite the work that is required. They say the current ban will not only have a major impact on residents and developers, but the townrsquos economy.NI Waterrsquos Stephen Blockwell confirmed to Newry, Mourne and Down councillors that the drainage study will not be completed until next December. He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December . It takes time to do this work and analysis and get the right solution. If there is available funding, we will be able to bring schemes forward.ldquoThere are under capacity issues across Northern Ireland in relation to wastewater treatment works but there are parts of the Saintfield area like Darragh Cross where development is not restricted.Mr Blockwell added: ldquoUnfortunately for some current residents in Saintfield when there is heavy rainfall, there is restricted toilet use. This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years. This is unacceptable.Cllr Andrews said Saintfieldrsquos existing sewerage system could not cope and there were major questions over the long term future of the townrsquos treatment plant.ldquoThe preparatory work to identy solutions must be completed as soon as possible and the money required to signicantly upgrade the system must be made available, he said.ldquoI believe a new treatment works is required, but it will take time to deliver such a strategic capital investment scheme.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is being predominantly funded by Transport for Londonand the Government.In October, it was announced both TfL and the Department for Transport had commissioned an independent review of Crossrailrsquos governance and a separate review of its finance and commercial position.Sir Terry told the BBC there had been some ldquounfortunate comment about who knew what and when about whether the Crossrail project was running late.ldquoIrsquom very confident that Crossrail behaved properly, he said, claiming he told TfL and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan on July  the programme could not be delivered this year.A mayoral spokesman said:ldquoThe mayor considers it a damning indictment of Crossrail governance that the Mayor and TfL had to commission an independent report to tell them the true scale of the delays to the project.ldquoThis is the kind of crucial information that really should have come from the chairman, but didnrsquot.ldquoThe mayor has been clear that he discussed rising cost and schedule pressures with Crossrail Ltd over the summer, including looking at the implicationsthese issues werenrsquot resolved.ldquoAt the meeting at the end of July it was clear that the opening date was at high risk of being missed but it was not until the end of August that the mayor, TfL and the DfT were told that the opening of the central section would definitely be delayed until Autumn  ndash something the mayor has not hidden his anger and disappointment about.A DfT spokesman said the department did not comment on ldquopersonnel matters, but added in a statement: ldquoWe can confirm that the Crossrail board took the decision to delay the opening on Wednesday August  and informed the Secretary of State of that decision on August ..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: HS rail chief expects sack within days article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is an important agreement.ldquoWe will send a clear signal mdash in any case, most of us mdash for the success of global climate talks starting in Poland on Sunday, Ms Merkel added.Her spokesman said that during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, she also voiced concern about rising tensions in the Kerch Strait off Crimea and pushed for ldquofreedom of shipping into the Sea of Azov.Last weekend, Russia seized three Ukrainian naval vessels and their crews in an incident escalating a tug-of-war that began in  when Russia annexed Ukrainersquos Crimean Peninsula and supported separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.Germany and France have sought to mediate between Russia and Ukraine, and spokesman Steffen Seibert said Ms Merkel and Mr Putin agreed the four countries should hold further talks at the ldquoadviser level.US President Donald Trump listens to Germanyrsquos Chancellor Angela Merkel Ms Merkel also said she hopes a meeting between the US and Chinese leaders will help resolve trade tensions between the two countries.Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to meet on the sidelines of the summit in Buenos Aires.Ms Merkel told reporters it is important the talks ldquohopefully bring solutions, because all of us see that we are affected indirectly when Chinese-American economic relations are not as frictionless as a world order requires.The isions among the worldrsquos leading economies were evident from the moment Argentinarsquos president opened the summit Friday with a call for international cooperation to solve the planetrsquos problems.In closing remarks, summit host and Argentine President Mauricio Macri said the countries had overcome ldquoa number of challenges to reach the agreement.He said: ldquoWe have agreed on a statement that reflects the necessity of revitalising trade, of revitalising the WTO.ldquoWe raty the concern of everyone over climate change.The next G summit is to be held in Osaka, Japan, in June ..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: G leaders make trade agreement article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

On average,  months after rollout, foodbanks see a % increase in demand, compared to % in areas with Universal Credit for  months or less.“All the evidence available suggests that the introduction of Universal Credit in new communities is swtly followed by hardship for struggling families. The introduction of welfare cuts has led to foodbanks being overrun and all politicians locally need to recognise the impact of welfare cuts it has on the people they represent. “The new welfare system is increasingly driving referrals to food banks due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.“The generosity of people who donate to the foodbanks and the volunteers who manage and distribute the food are an inspiration.“Unfortunately, the winter months are more dficult were foodbanks typically receive more referrals for emergency support and we need to redouble our efforts. “To express our gratitude, the SDLP will be doing our bit this Christmas to assist local foodbanks and doing all we can to help families under pressure.”Council staff visit aerosol paint sellers after spike in graffiti Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Christmas1.jpg","title":"thought about the christmas party its just a few weeks away","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business A time for giving, the festive party is an event that puts the spotlight firmly on employer gratitude. Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre. The family-owned firm is taking on an empty unit at the front of Queen’s Arcade at Donegall Place. It already has its flagship store at the arcade. It comes as the company has unveiled a new Rolex workshop at its Belfast base, which means it can carry out servicing of the watches in-house. Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade. It represents a big investment in Rolex parts and machinery, but we believe it is an essential part of the authentic Rolex experience.” Richard de Leyser, managing director, Rolex UK, said: “I’m delighted that Lunn’s continues to invest in our partnership and excited at the prospect of expanding the Rolex offering in Queen’s Arcade. “The plans to extend the space dedicated to Rolex and provide a new and engaging customer experience will perfectly position Lunn’s to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing retail environment. “The contemporary space will complement the historic architecture of Queen’s Arcade and provide a fitting home for Rolex.  We are proud to partner Lunn’s in this new development which will further enhance the unrivalled service to our customers in Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”. Joining Ms Graham at the Banquet was guest speaker Jed Mercurio, creator of BBC hit dramas Bodyguard and Line of Duty.
