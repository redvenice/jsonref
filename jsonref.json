Lake Semlevo in the Smolensk region has been thought to contain Napoleon\u0027s loot ever since the 19th century, but Ryzhkov says this is a fraudAccording to a member of Napoleon\u0027s staff, Philippe-Paul de Ségur, the loot was hidden in Lake Semlevo in the Smolensk region in western Russia.Scottish novelist Sir Walter Scott added further fuel to the rumour when he mentioned the treasure in his 1825 biography, \u0027The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte.\u0027Historians and archaeologists have scoured the area of Lake Semlevo ever since and the legend has been bolstered by huge troves of weapons and ammunition that have been uncovered around the lake.The Russian paper reported that the Soviet\u0027s made extensive efforts to retrieve the treasure in the 1960s and 1970s to no avail.But according to the Moskovskij Komsomolets paper, Vladimir Poryvaev who has hunted the treasure for years says Ryzhkov\u0027s story is absurd.He cited the idea of 400 wagons as particularly outlandish, saying this \u0027secret\u0027 convoy would have stretched for miles.Poryvaev also mocks the idea asking what scuba gear Napoleon\u0027s men had for their complex underwater burial at the the bottom of an icy lake in the middle of winter.Russia searches for Napoleon\u0027s gold - BBC News"},{"url":null,"title":"Muslim Congresswoman Ilhan Omar makes history wearing hijab","story":"Moment of history: Ilhan Omar took her seat wearing the hijab, the first ever woman to do so and the first person to wear a religious head covering in Congress          The 37-year-old who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Somali represents the fifth district of Minnesota  Rep.

It\u0027s my choice—one protected by the first amendment. And this is not the last ban I\u0027m going to work to lift,\u0027 she tweeted in November after she was elected.Incoming Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Incoming House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern backed Omar in her request and included it in the rules package they released late Tuesday night.

They came to the United States in 1995, when she was 12, and they ended up in Minneapolis in 1997.Her election to Congress brought many firsts: the first Somali American and first Muslim refugee elected. Omar was born in Somalia but fled the war-torn country with her family when she was ten, then spent years in a refugee camp in Kenya before being granted asylum in the U.S. and settling first in Arlington, Virginia, then in Minneapolis.She also became the first woman of color to represent Minnesota on Capitol Hill.Omar won the House seat formerly occupied by Democrat Keith Ellison, who was the first Muslim congressman to be elected to Congress.Another lawmaker famous for her head gear, Democratic Rep. Fredrica Wilson of Florida, tried to change the hat ban in 2010 - when she was first elected to Congress - to no avail.\u0027\u0027It\u0027s sexist,\u0027 Wilson told the Miami Herald at the time. \u0027It dates back to when men wore hats and we know that men don\u0027t wear hats indoors, but women wear hats indoors. Hats are what I wear. People get excited when they see the hats. Once you get accustomed to it, it\u0027s just me. Some people wear wigs, or high heel shoes or big earrings or pins.

Disgusting. Also, no way his pie shop can fund all that\u0027. Another exclaimed: \u0027Did he really have a kid with her when she was a child!?#21kidsandcounting.\u0027The couple have previously said they were determined to keep their first child, Chris, because they had both been adopted at birth. They were married four years after his birth in 1989, and moved into together. Their second child, Sophie, was born when Mrs Radford was 17. The age of consent for sexual activity in the UK is 16. In England and Wales, the age of sexual consent for women has been set at 16 since 1885, after campaigners fought to raise it from 13 to prevent child prostitution.  The law says it is an offence for anyone to have any sexual activity with a person under the age of 16. However, Home Office guidance is clear that there is no intention to prosecute teenagers under the age of 16 where both mutually agree and where they are of a similar age.In last night\u0027s programme, the couple children told how they were shocked at the revelation of the latest pregnancy, with the youngsters appearing on camera to state that they hadn\u0027t believed their mother when she had first revealed the news.Daughter Chloe, joked that \u0027she had obviously stopped taking her contraception\u0027, while son James, aged 15 said he had always wondered what went through his parents\u0027 minds and said they \u0027didn\u0027t know when to stop\u0027.The show highlighted the financial plight the family is set to face with another child on the way and showed Mr Radford working in the pie shop that he runs with the help from his daughter Chloe.          Social media users pointed out that Sue Radford first became pregnant when she was 13          The fact that Noel, then her boyfriend and now her husband, was 18 at the time also raised eyebrows           The TV special provoked comment on Twitter both in favour and critical of the outsized family          Mrs Radford and her husband Noel, 47 (pictured), had their first child, Chris, 28 years ago, when Sue was aged only 14.

Pregnant at 13 by an 18yo, continue to breed without a card to the burden they\u0027re putting on the environment or public services.

Among his finds was Dali\u0027s celebrated piece \u0027Adolescence\u0027 (pictured) Investigator nicknamed the \u0027Indiana Jones of the art world\u0027...Dali’s £850,000 lobster phone is saved for the nation after...Share this articleFor Mr Brand carries out a very specific type of work – unearthing priceless pieces of art which have been hidden, lost or stolen for years, decades or even centuries.Among his greatest finds are two bronze horse sculptures hidden by Hitler and always presumed destroyed, a 1,600 year old Cypriot mosaic worth £10m and countless Renoirs, Picassos or Van Goghs.The private investigator\u0027s efforts have quite rightly earned him the soubriquet of Indiana Jones of the art world.In 2014, he found the world\u0027s most valuable Nazi haul of art – which included £4 million bronze horses – in a two year chase across EuropeEarlier this year he uncovered a 1,600 year old stolen Cypriot St Mark mosaic - worth £10m – which was by then inadvertently owned by a British couple.Now he has set his sights on... Bristol city council as he tries to wrest a Renoir painting from them and return it to its original owners.In an exclusive interview with MailOnline at his home in Amsterdam, he describes in detail his methods which have seen him succeed where the authorities have failed.          Earlier this year Mr Brand, who says he\u0027s more like Inspector Clouseau, uncovered a 1,600 year old stolen Cypriot St Mark mosaic, worth £10m, which was by then owned by a British coupleHis techniques are unorthodox, low key and increasingly successful, making him constantly in demand around the world.He is a patient man and spends years at a time searching for a single piece of art, criss-crossing the world in relentless pursuit of his target.When a piece of art is stolen, it invariably changes hands on the black market and the police investigate.After a period of about two years - once the police investigation has inevitably failed to infiltrate this criminal underworld - Arthur gets involved.          Among his greatest finds are two bronze horse sculptures hidden by Hitler and  and countless Renoirs, Picassos or Van Goghs\u0027I ask around and eventually I\u0027ll call someone and say that I hear they have a stolen Picasso or Van Gogh or a de Lempicka or whatever it is in their possession,\u0027 he says.\u0027They say that they have no idea what I\u0027m talking about and put the phone down. Then I\u0027m on to something. Three days later they always call back.\u0027They say that they had nothing to do with the original theft, but now they\u0027re stuck with this often priceless artwork because they can\u0027t hand it in or give it back, for fear of the criminals they\u0027d traded with or for fear of investigation themselves.\u0027So they trust me to return the artwork and protect everyone\u0027s privacy. I always stay within the law. And as long as no one gets hurt in the process, everyone\u0027s happy.\u0027Reflecting on his success, he tells MailOnline: \u0027Everyone thinks I\u0027m like Indiana Jones. But I\u0027m more like Inspector Clouseau!\u0027On the surface I\u0027m a private detective who cracks the world\u0027s biggest art cases like uncovering Hitler\u0027s Horses, but really I\u0027m the biggest idiot in the world who always follows the wrong lead and suspects the wrong person, before I finally crack it.\u0027I generally solve 80 per cent of my cases or I\u0027m still working on them now.\u0027The art world is just people lying and cheating to make money. But I\u0027m only interested in returning art to its natural home so that it can be enjoyed for future generations.\u0027I work with all kinds of art dealers, criminals, coppers, Nazis and Jews. I\u0027ll hassle people until they talk to me, but I\u0027m always honest and I keep people\u0027s confidences so they know that they\u0027re better off dealing with me than anyone else.\u0027All the wealthy art elite laugh at me because I\u0027m just a simple guy who travels everywhere by bus, sometimes carrying priceless art, and I have a basic old mobile phone.\u0027But I can\u0027t be corrupted by anyone so that\u0027s why everyone trusts me.\u0027Mr Brand learnt his trade from Michel Van Rijn, the man said to be responsible for at least 90 per cent of global art crime before switching sides and working for London\u0027s Scotland Yard to expose the murky world of art fraud.  Mr Brand\u0027s techniques are unorthodox, low key and increasingly successful, making him constantly in demand around the world. He recovered this piece by Tamara de Lempicka (pictured) by criss-crossing the world in relentless pursuit of his targetHe initially became London-based Van Rijn\u0027s gopher – opening suspected parcel bombs sent to him and ringing his enemy, a fake coin trader, to insult him as instructed.But Mr Brand became hooked on his teacher\u0027s \u0027crazy\u0027 world.His first profile case came in 2006 when he helped reveal pieces of a suspected 1,700 year old Gospel of Judas secretly being sold on the black market.It enraged Christians because it offered the alternative theory that Jesus had asked his trusted friend Judas to be portrayed as betraying the Son of Christ, so that Jesus could be crucified as pre-ordained.But Mr Brand really hit the big time with the discovery of the two £3 million Joseph Thorak horse sculptures which were thought to have been destroyed.It was while watching a documentary about Hitler in 2014 that he realised Hitler\u0027s Horses had been moved from the steps of Berlin\u0027s Reich Chancellery in the last film ever recorded of Adolf Hitler before his suicide.This meant that the horses - which had held pride of place under Hitler\u0027s office balcony - couldn\u0027t have been destroyed in the bombing of Berlin at the end of World War Two as previously thought.That sent him on a worldwide, two-year hunt before he found the horses among a priceless art and military treasure trove in a Nazi\u0027s garage in Bad Duerkheim, south west Germany.After false starts, false tip-offs and exhaustive research, he identified a compound of Nazi homes in the Rhineland where police found the horses and two Gustav Klimt statues alongside a cache of Nazi tanks, rockets and weaponry.It has been called the most significant Nazi art haul – altogether priceless – since the end of the Second World War.\u0027I had turned established history for over 70 years on its head,\u0027 he said. \u0027Next year they\u0027ll be showing my discovery in Germany for the first time since the war and I\u0027ll finally get to see it all.\u0027This really is the most remarkable thing that I will ever do in my life.\u0027          Mr Brand hit the big time by discovering the two £3m Joseph Thorak horse sculptures which were on the steps of Berlin\u0027s Reich Chancellery and were thought to have been destroyed          Reflecting on his success, Mr Brand tells MailOnline: On the surface I\u0027m a private detective who cracks the world\u0027s biggest art cases, but really I\u0027m the biggest idiot in the world who always follows the wrong lead and suspects the wrong person, before I finally crack it\u0027Mr Brand hit another high this year alongside London antiquities trader William Veres when after a two-year search across Europe they uncovered the Cypriot, 1,600 year old St Mark mosaic - worth £10m and one of the last missing pieces of Byzantine art.It had been stolen from the country\u0027s Kanakaria Church in Nicosia after the 1974 Turkish invasion which ided Cyprus before ultimately ending up in the hands of an unsupecting British couple.They eventually handed it over to Mr Brand in the tax exile of Monaco so he could finally return it to the Cyrpiot embassy.\u0027This was another of the greatest moments of my life,\u0027 he says.\u0027This is truly one of the last outstanding pieces to be returned. It\u0027s incredible to think that this piece or art survived for so long. It\u0027s part of the Cypriot peoples\u0027 soul.\u0027All I got for that pretty much was some pieces of the mosaic, a medal and a certificate. People around me get rich, while I get certificates!\u0027But I don\u0027t care about making money, all I care about is having adventures, like Indiana Jones. That\u0027s what keeps me going.\u0027Now Mr Brand has set his lofty sights on a distinctly British target.As Nazi war spoils have gradually been returned from collectors all over the world, there is one British institution holding out - Bristol City Council.Renoir\u0027s The Coast of Cagnes was originally owned by Jakob and Rosa Oppenheimer of Magraf art dealers - until the Nazis banned them from being directors in 1933.It was then bought by an Austrian Jew who left it to Bristol Museum and Art Gallery on his death, who are refusing to accept it was a trophy of war.\u0027It\u0027s astonishing that art collectors all over the world have returned priceless artwork lost under Nazi-occupation – yet Bristol City Council stands alone in refusing to return this Renoir to the Oppenheimers, despite the family being forced out of their art dealership and their business eventually going under, we say, as a result.\u0027Now they\u0027ve hired me to set the record straight. I\u0027m going to make so much noise on this and I won\u0027t give up until that Renoir is back in the hands of the Oppenheimers where it belongs.\u0027I won\u0027t let Bristol council get away with this.\u0027The Spoliation Advisory Panel, which considers claims over cultural objects lost during the Nazi era but now held by UK museums and galleries, has rejected the claim and believes the Renoir was sold due to bank debt rather than persecution by Hitler\u0027s regime."},{"url":null,"title":"Historian says treasure hunters spent 200 years looking wrong place Napoleons loot","story":"    Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte\u0027s humiliating retreat from Moscow in 1812 during bitter winter weather which claimed the lives of many of his troops          Viacheslav Ryzhkov alleges Lake Bolshaya Rutavech (pictured) is the real location of Napoleon\u0027s 80 tonnes of gold and jewels looted from MoscowShare this article    A map showing Ryzhkov\u0027s hometown of Rudnya close to the Belarus border where he alleges the treasure is buried to the west of Smolensk where a member of Napoleon\u0027s staff had claimed the loot was thrown into Lake Semlevo after the warThe historian told the Rabochy Put newspaper he believes unfounded rumours were deliberately disseminated by Napoleon\u0027s men to hide the true location of the treasure close to the Belorussian border. The French Emperor had the treasure brought close to the historian\u0027s hometown of Rudnya where it was thrown into Lake Bolshaya Rutavech, the Russian paper reports.The historian claims Napoleon had some of the treasure melted into ingots before it was packed off on 400 wagons accompanied by 500 cavalry and 250 members of Napoleon\u0027s elite Old Guard.Ryzhkov told Rabochy Put that the Emperor himself went with the treasure to oversee its complicated burial. A platform was built out into the centre of the lake and the bounty was buried at the bottom of the water.Ryzhkov claims that due to the elaborate way in which the loot was hidden advanced technology and experts will be needed to salvage the gold.He also said that studies of the water in the 1980s noted a high concentration of silver particles.The myth of the stolen treasure dates back to the Grand Armée\u0027s embarrassing retreat from Moscow when they were said to have carried off gold and jewels from the city.The story goes that during their retreat through bitter December cold the Russian troops decided to bury the load.          Lake Semlevo in the Smolensk region has been thought to contain Napoleon\u0027s loot ever since the 19th century, but Ryzhkov says this is a fraudAccording to a member of Napoleon\u0027s staff, Philippe-Paul de Ségur, the loot was hidden in Lake Semlevo in the Smolensk region in western Russia.Scottish novelist Sir Walter Scott added further fuel to the rumour when he mentioned the treasure in his 1825 biography, \u0027The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte.\u0027Historians and archaeologists have scoured the area of Lake Semlevo ever since and the legend has been bolstered by huge troves of weapons and ammunition that have been uncovered around the lake.The Russian paper reported that the Soviet\u0027s made extensive efforts to retrieve the treasure in the 1960s and 1970s to no avail.But according to the Moskovskij Komsomolets paper, Vladimir Poryvaev who has hunted the treasure for years says Ryzhkov\u0027s story is absurd.He cited the idea of 400 wagons as particularly outlandish, saying this \u0027secret\u0027 convoy would have stretched for miles.Poryvaev also mocks the idea asking what scuba gear Napoleon\u0027s men had for their complex underwater burial at the the bottom of an icy lake in the middle of winter.Russia searches for Napoleon\u0027s gold - BBC News"},{"url":null,"title":"England rugby star Sam Burgesss messy split Aussie golden girl","story":"    South Sydney star footballer Sam Burgess leaves the home he shared with wife Phoebe in Sydney\u0027s south-east on Wednesday afternoon after their \u0027pretty messy\u0027 split emerged  NRL and England star Sam Burgess (pictured outside his marital home in Sydney on Wednesday) having split from his wife of three years Phoebe (together right)          Phoebe Burgess announced the December 9 birth of her second child William \u0027Billy\u0027 Burgess (pictured) - but they have since gone their separate ways          Did Joanna Burgess take a swipe at Phoebe Burgess on Christmas Day?

Cummings, a mercurial and intelligent strategist, stoking the fire of Brexit behind the scenes, with Gove, alongside Boris Johnson, as the public face of the official campaign me, doing all I can to dampen the flames and get people to focus elsewhere.Cumberbatch says he took the Cummings role because of James Graham’s script, but there is no doubt that the master strategist behind Brexit also provides a fascinating character for any actor.Witnessing him in action before the referendum campaign, it was clear Cummings was highly effective at being isive. It was he who characterised the educational establishment as ‘the blob’ and wound up anyone and everyone with his vicious, mischievous and — of course — anonymous outpourings on Twitter.At that time, he was clearly behind a series of briefings against David Cameron. So much so that he and Michael Gove were invited into Number 10 and asked if there was anything he wanted to get off his chest.Cummings, it turned out, wasn’t so willing to criticise the Prime Minister to his face, and my memory of the meeting was of him meekly praising Cameron. Afterwards we wondered where the reckless rebel of folklore had been. After all, this was someone who reportedly used to sign himself into Whitehall meetings under the name Osama bin Laden.At the time, my view of Cummings was summed up by quoting that scene from Monty Python’s Life Of Brian, ‘He’s not the Messiah, he’s just a naughty boy’. The line was changed in the TV version to, ‘He’s not the Messiah. He’s just a f****** a*****le’. So how accurate was the rest of the drama?          The charts the story of the clash of political campaigners, with Cummings directing the Leave campaign and Oliver directing the Remain sideFrom the moment the film was announced, critics of Brexit were worried that having an international superstar like Benedict Cumberbatch playing Cummings would give the man more credence than he deserved. They feared Cummings would be lionised, rather than held to account.At first, I worried too. Surely a star of Cumberbatch’s calibre would create sympathy for a man who should be confronted with tough questions.And the fact is that, having delivered the Brexit vote, Cummings disappeared in a puff of smoke. After setting the fire going, he steadfastly avoided media interviews — and refused to appear in front of a Parliamentary committee to answer difficult questions about data use and dodgy claims during his campaign.Most of my fears were allayed, however, when I visited the film set and saw that Cumberbatch was almost unrecognisable, having shaved his head to create Cummings’ unmistakably sparse thatch and bald forehead. He has not glamorised Cummings, just sort of inhabited him.The first half of James Graham’s sophisticated and thoughtful script is devoted to exploring Cummings, the Machiavellian guru who can connect with, and prey on, people’s fears.He is shown running rings around the likes of Brexiter Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, whose cack-handed attempt to get Cummings fired from the official Leave campaign blew up in his face.But if the first half of the film pays heed to Cummings’ undoubted intelligence, and can be seen as the case for his defence, the second is the case for the prosecution.Johnson and Gove are shown at one point looking perplexed and perturbed as Cummings dances manically in front of his notorious campaign red bus on which he had slapped the deeply misleading message: ‘We send the EU £350 million a week. Let’s fund our NHS instead. Vote Leave.’          James Graham, who wrote Brexit : The Uncivil War, said Cumberbatch wanted to play Dominic Cummings with ‘sympathy and understanding’At this point, the Remain campaign comes into sharp focus, trying to defend an unsatisfactory status quo and complex realities, from immigration to the European Court of Justice, in the face of simple claims that Utopia is just around the corner, if only we can leave the dastardly EU.It shows how Cummings sets about systematically and carelessly unleashing the demons of David Cameron’s nightmares.As for the scenes in which I am portrayed, I watched through splayed fingers, groaning as I saw that Rory Kinnear had captured my mannerisms and tics as I tried to have some time with my children while taking a conference call with David Cameron and Peter Mandelson.Kinnear also captured my sense of despair as I watched anti-Brexit campaigner Bob Geldof flicking V signs at Nigel Farage as they barracked each other during their notorious River Thames confrontation at Westminster, when rival pro-Remain and pro-Brexit flotillas clashed. ‘Is this what we’ve come to?’ I asked.The film shows how the murder of the kind, brave and thoughtful Labour MP Jo Cox stopped the campaign short. A moment to reflect about what things are really worth.I suspect how you judge Brexit: The Uncivil War will depend on whether you are Remain, Leave or simply uncertain. It’s extremely well written, acted, directed and produced.If I have one small criticism, it is that the film focuses too much on the exploitation of data as the reason Leave won, suggesting it was simply clinical brilliance that triumphed, rather than the cynical calculation of Cummings and his team, who were too willing to ride in the slipstream of Nigel Farage as he threw out raw, red meat to his supporters with exaggerated and irresponsible claims. It could also have done more to acknowledge that many of the 17.4 million who voted Leave did so out of anger at Brussels’ arrogance and the billions being paid to the EU.The drama is at its best when it shows Dominic Cummings as a master of disruption and destruction, who struggles to make things work long-term.More than two-and-a-half years after the EU referendum, we’re nowhere near the Brexit Utopia he and the Leave campaign promised.          Cummings, pictured here with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove ran the Vote Leave campaignAt the end of the TV version, Dominic and I meet for a drink. He tells me the hard truth that a new type of politics is coming, ‘One that you can’t control’.I ask him, ‘What’s your edge?’ What has he found to make things any better? He doesn’t have an answer.That meeting never happened. But writer James Graham invents it — legitimately in my view — as a means of summing up the clash of two very different world views: Me – believing the world is complex, muddy and requires compromise Cummings the absolutist who demands creative destruction.In that make-believe conversation, I make the case for ‘a kinder, gentler politics’ — and my fear that it has been lost. That’s exactly what I feel having been through the madness, bitterness and bloodshed of the referendum and its aftermath.I hope the film will serve as a warning that the political class needs to sober up - and focus more on what unites, than what ides us. Respect is due on both sides. And it is my belief that the only way through the current chaos is for Parliament to find a cross-party common ground that finally allows us to move on.As for me and Dominic, I’m more than happy to make that drink a reality. Talk it over. Make the peace – and help put out that fire once and for all.So how about it, Dominic? The drink’s on me.Brexit: The Uncivil War is on Channel 4 at 9pm on Monday, January 7."},{"url":null,"title":"Water weird buffalo Huge beast emerges Indian pond","story":"    One of the buffalo covered in algae.  A trio of huge half tonne water buffalo bathing in an algae-covered pond blend in so well a photographer mistook them for rocks          These three 8ft-long water buffalo, captured at Osam Hill in Rajkot, India, swim to cool themselves down and also feed on the floating aquatic plants          Would you recognise these shapes as bathing buffalo?

The German parliament building was relatively new at the time, having opened in 1894 following the unification of the country in 1871. Located near the Brandenburg Gate, it was severely damaged by the 1933 fire that helped cement Hitler\u0027s power and by Allied bombing during World War II. Largely disused during the Cold War, it re-opened in 1999 with the glass dome designed by Norman Foster replacing the original dome pictured in the 19th-century image          Piccadilly Circus, London. The junction in central London looks familiar even in the older picture, with the Eros statue - put up in 1893 - in its original position in the centre of the circus. The horse-pulled traffic has since been replaced by cars and buses, and the Underground station opened in 1906 on what was then the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway           Piazza del Popolo (People\u0027s Square), Rome. The square is dominated by the Egyptian obelisk dedicated to Ramesses II, pharaoh of Egypt in ancient times. The monument was built in the 10th century and moved here in 1589. Behind the obelisk are the two Roman Catholic churches of Santa Maria dei Miracoli and Santa Maria in MontesantoArc de Triomphe, Paris. The French capital\u0027s most famous landmark aside from the Eiffel Tower, the Arc was commissioned by Napoleon in 1806 to celebrate his victories in Europe but political turmoil in France delayed its completion until 1836. The names of French victories and generals are inscribed in the monument. Since the earlier picture was taken it has also become a memorial to France\u0027s wars in the 20th century and an unknown warrior was buried underneath it in 1921    Westminster Abbey, London. A church has stood on the site since the 10th century but it took on its current status as a Royal Peculiar under Queen Elizabeth I in 1560. It houses graves and monuments to British luminaries across the centuries, including monarchs, politicians, poets and scientists, as well as the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior buried there in 1920          St Peter\u0027s Square, Vatican City. In this older view of the Holy See, St Peter\u0027s Basilica - the centrepiece of the Vatican under which the apostle of Jesus is held to be buried - is just visible on the left. Popes have resided in the Vatican for over a thousand years but the square with its arches and colonnades was built in the 17th-century. On the left is an obelisk brought from EgyptEiffel Tower, Paris. The landmark tower was a recent addition to the Paris skyline when this picture was taken. It was built in the 1880s ahead of a world\u0027s fair in Paris in 1889 which marked a century since the French Revolution. Named after designer Gustave Eiffel, it originally faced opposition from Parisians who compared it to a \u0027half-built factory pipe\u0027    Notre Dame, Paris. Work on the Catholic cathedral began in 1163 but it was not fully completed for almost two centuries, later serving as the venue for Napoleon\u0027s coronation after he became Emperor of the French in 1804. After World War II there were major efforts to clean the cathedral, returning it to its original lighter colour           Nicolaaskerk, Amsterdam.

The museum with its domes and fountains was opened in 1891, and is located at the top of Wenceslas Square in the Czech capital. When the earlier picture was taken Prague was part of Bohemia which in turn belonged to Austria-Hungary. The building is still standing but it suffered severe damage during bombing in 1945 and again during the Prague Spring in 1968 when Soviet tanks were sent in to quell a rebellion against Moscow    Kungstradgarden, Stockholm. Meaning King\u0027s Garden, the park dates back to the 15th century and has become one of the landmarks of the Swedish capital. It was once the site of a mansion but it burned down in 1825, and half a century later the gardens opened to the public Colosseum, Rome. This ancient monument has changed relatively little since the older picture was taken. The amphitheatre was finished in the year AD 80 during the days of the Roman Empire, when up to 50,000 people would go to the stadium to watch battles and executions. The Pope holds a service there every Friday in memory of early Christians who died there    British Museum, London. The museum opened in 1753 and the bulk of the current building was opened in the 19th century, housing collections from through the centuries including treasured Anglo-Saxon items from the Sutton Hoo hoard and the Rosetta Stone which helped historians read ancient Egyptian hieroglyphicsPiazza Navona, Rome. This square was once the site of a stadium for 20,000 spectators to watch athletic competitions in Ancient Rome. Today is is dominated by fountains created during the reign of Pope Gregory XIII    Louvre, Paris. The area began life as a royal fortress for Kings of France in the 12th century in what was then an outer part of the city. In the 16th century it became the primary royal residence for French monarchs, before the revolution of 1789 eliminated the royal family and turned the site into a museum. The pyramid which is now one of the icons of the Louvre art gallery - home to the Mona Lisa - was added in the 1980s as one of the Grands Projets of French president Francois Mitterrand          General Art and Industrial Exposition of Stockholm. This picture from 1897 shows a world\u0027s fair which was held in the Swedish capital that year, lasting for some five months and showing off recent technologies such as X-rays and telephones           Prague Castle. When the picture was taken at the turn of the 20th century the castle was the residence of the last Kings of Bohemia before the kingdom was replaced by Czechoslovakia after the end of World War I. It is a huge complex of churches, palaces and other buildings, including the window from which Catholic officials were thrown in 1618 - the Defenestration of Prague - in an event which helped to spark the Thirty Years\u0027 War. Today it is the official seat of the Czech President          Palace of Westminster, London. The site was first a church in Anglo-Saxon times, becoming the \u0027West Minster\u0027 from which the area in central London gets its modern name. In the Middle Ages it became a royal palace and representatives from across England began meeting at Westminster when the first Parliaments began to meet in the 13th century. It became the regular seat of the House of Commons and Lords but the building was destroyed by fire in 1834, prompting the construction of the modern parliamentary building. The clock tower known as Big Ben was part of the rebuilding work London Bridge. The bridge named in the nursery rhyme London Bridge Is Falling Down has actually described a series of different river crossings over the centuries. The one pictured was opened in 1831 and at the turn of the century, around the time this picture was taken, it saw 8,000 pedestrians crossing every hour. That bridge was sold to an American buyer in 1967, who had it moved to Arizona, and replaced with the current overpass between Tower Bridge and Cannon Street rail bridge    Luxembourg Palace, Paris. This royal palace from the 17th century was one of the residences of French monarchs and became a prison in the French Revolution. Today it is the seat of the Senate, one of two national legislative assemblies in France           Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome. The church dates back to ancient times, originally built in the fourth century on the site of what had once been a pagan temple. Its name refers to the fact it is the largest of 26 churches in Rome which are dedicated to the Virgin Mary           State Opera, Berlin. This is a view of Unter den Linden, one of the city\u0027s main thoroughfares which runs from the Brandenburg Gate - which would later form part of the Wall during the Cold War - towards Alexanderplatz in East Berlin. The opera house, on the right, was founded in 1742. Out of shot to the right is a square, once called Opera Square, where the Nazis burned piles of books after coming to power in 1933. The site is now commemorated with an underground set of empty bookshelves           Altes Museum (Old Museum), Berlin. Located on the city\u0027s Museum Island, the Altes Museum near Berlin Cathedral is one of several which houses treasures from the ancient world including Rome and Greece. It was built for the Prussian royal family in the 1820s and has survived to this day despite serious damage during the fall of Berlin in 1945           Capitoline Hill, Rome.

Tracey Emin’s installation painstakingly recreated her bed as it appeared after an alcohol-fuelled breakdown, triggered by the end of a relationship. A disordered tangle of used and dirty stockings, towels and sheets, the undersheet spilling freely over the bed’s base, was bordered by the accumulated debris of an exhausted life. This was not a bed of peaceful rest, airy dreams or frenzied coupling, but of illness, exhaustion and despair. The intoxicants and condoms strewn around conveyed not a lively appetite, but a quest for physical and psychic numbness, plunging us into a state the French sociologist Alain Ehrenberg called “weariness of the self”.Ehrenberg diagnosed this weariness as the essential malaise of our time. He described a chronic incapacity arising from a state of perpetual work – not only the long hours spent in waged employment, but the state of permanent busyness induced by daily demands to act and consume. This has been accentuated, since Ehrenberg published his book, by the 247 imperatives of online life: follow, like, update, upload, link and (of course) buy.This culture induces an intense yearning for the state of rest it denies us. Driven by a spirit of anxiously competitive workaholism, or by the simple need to survive, millions of men and women spend a vast proportion of their lives at work. Advertisements for energy drinks and flu remedies promise to power through illness and exhaustion and spare us (and our employers) a day off. And as work is proclaimed as high value, non-work is loudly condemned – in shrill tabloid fantasies of welfare scroungers and migrants enjoying easy lives at our expense, in the drive of western governments both left and right of centre to ensure we remain in work, in the withholding and denial of disabled welfare benefits.In my daily work as a psychoanalyst, this atmosphere of enforced, anxious overactivity pervades my consulting room. I listen to men and women pressed in from all sides by the demands to work harder as employees, as parents, as consumers, yearning for a little silence and reclusion, a momentary break in the flow of noise.Across contemporary culture, we find this condition expressed in myriad forms and voices. Sifting through these voices, we can discern four broad and frequently recurrent character types: the burnout, derailed from his blind impulsion to act and achieve by a sudden, overwhelming need to stop, to which he can only blankly surrender the slob, who turns lassitude, gluttony and indifference to self and world into an elective way of life the daydreamer, who eludes the burdens of daily life by taking off into the far reaches of the imagination and the slacker, who turns an aversion to the real world and its demands into a concrete ethos and lifestyle. In these figures, we can make out currents of resistance, both brash and subtle, to the rule of blind, incessant activity.There are few more powerfully concentrated images of the burnout than the absent occupant of Emin’s bed. But if My Bed could be said to have a fictional analogue, I suggest we’d find it in Ottessa Moshfegh’s My Year of Rest and Relaxation, published last year.Moshfegh’s unnamed narrator, a woman in her early 20s whose parents have died, is already weary of the dubious, too easily available enticements of art, sex and money. She resolves to self-induce a year-long sleep, punctuated only by short waking intervals to feed herself. She is, to recall Ehrenberg, weary of the self, investing all her energy and ingenuity in a scheme to reduce her bodily and mental agitation to near zero. Even before this experiment in self-annulment, she has started “hibernating”, downing sleeping pills, letting her muscles waste and watching vapid movies on VHS: “I couldn’t stand to watch regular television. Especially at the beginning, TV aroused too much in me, and I’d get compulsive about the remote, clicking around, scoffing at everything and agitating myself.”Moshfegh’s narrator recalls an earlier fictional shut-in: Jean Des Esseintes, the protagonist of Joris-Karl Huysman’s cult 1884 novel À Rebours, or Against Nature. Des Esseintes’s tragicomic trials centre on his desperate attempts to return his body and mind, ravaged by sexual and narcotic debauchery, to a state of undisturbed peace. He leaves the fleshpots of Paris for his quiet villa in the suburbs, where he tries and fails to forge a life of monastic abstemiousness.These characters are caught in a tormenting predicament: however hard they try to sink into oblivion, they cannot help feeling the scratch of worldly demands and desires, giving rise to a state of heightened enervation that ruins both work and relaxation. This is the state of burnout, a term first used in a diagnostic sense by the German-American psychologist Herbert J Freudenberger in 1974, to refer to the growing phenomenon of “physical or mental collapse caused by overwork or stress”.Freudenberger found burnt-out workers running on empty, depleted of all but the most minimal internal resources. Their exhaustion led to an intense longing for a state of rest, alongside the sense that it can’t be attained, that some anxiety or distraction won’t let them go. The human organism, it seems, is not hospitable to the zero state, however much it might desire it.Burning out involves a distressingly long and arduous route to the state of inactivity, which is then spoiled by nervousness, shame and guilt. The scandalous courage of the slob, in contrast, is to embrace the inertial state and openly reject diligence and responsibility.Freud often pointed to the erect posture as the definitive evolutionary achievement of the human being. Straightening our backs and tilting our chins up towards the firmament, we freed our heads from the disgusting and arousing smells of our intimate bodily selves, acquiring the dignity, order and discipline of form. The slob disturbs us because he puts us in touch with that formless, muddy region of the self we thought we’d risen above. We feel it when we sink exhausted into the sofa, abandoning ourselves to gravity’s downward pull. We feel it when our minds yield to the sludgy undertow of blank stupidity, when all our inner voice can do is hum moronic advertising jingles.No wonder the slob became the bete noire of Enlightenment thinking inducing numbness and apathy, laziness undoes its cherished ideals of autonomy and moral responsibility. The most celebrated and ambiguous instance of this hostility to laziness is found in Denis Diderot’s Rameau’s Nephew, a fictionalised dialogue with a notorious Parisian music tutor and society freeloader, posthumously published in 1805. Their discussion in a cafe quickly turns to the difficulties of Rameau, who supports his family by sponging off the wealthy – they tend to eject him soon after his amusement value has been exhausted. Diderot listens to his defence of his amoral, self-indulgent and thoroughly useless life with a show of outward disgust, leavened by a surreptitious amusement, even secret admiration.Diderot’s case for self-reliance and honesty is oddly flat next to Rameau’s seductive advocacy of slobbish abandon: “Drink good wine, blow yourself out with luscious food, have a tumble with lovely women, lie on soft beds.” The book puts us in touch with the Rameau concealed in us all, the big entitled baby who rails against the obstacles reality puts in the way of his contentment, who doesn’t see why he should be asked to work and be responsible.Let other people do it all so I don’t have to – Rameau’s watchword is also that of a more familiar and contemporary folk-heroic slob: Homer Simpson. Homer is a pop-cultural incarnation of what the French writer Georges Bataille called the spirit of “pure expenditure”: he wants what he wants right now, in limitless quantities. Homer and his friends are lazy slobs, for whom the will to consume always trumps the obligation to produce. The lurid glow of warm colour suffusing The Simpsons is a kind of atmospheric analogue to the nirvana of inanity induced by the abundance of Duff Beer and Lard Lad Donuts. Homer, like Snoopy, Garfield or Jeffrey “The Dude” Lebowski, played by Jeff Bridges, is the vicarious channel for the life of aimless sloth many of us would secretly like to live and have been forced to renounce.The slob resists the world’s demands by succumbing to the downward pull of gravity. The daydreamer does so by refusing it, by floating airily above her daily reality. Daydreaming is a refusal to equate life with quotidian existence.Why would anyone want to retreat into the clouds and abandon the urgent claims of life here below? In one of his scandalous inversions of received wisdom, Oscar Wilde suggested that action was the real refuge of “people who have nothing whatsoever to do”. “To do nothing at all,” he adds, “is the most difficult thing in the world,” because it deprives us of the easy evasions of busyness and purpose. Should we doubt this, we need only glance around a cafe, tube carriage or family dinner table and observe the reflexive flight of the eyes and hands around us into the anxious distractions of emails, box sets and Candy Crush.Occasionally, someone comes along and makes us question the superiority of action over contemplation. Take Emily Dickinson, who spent the largest part of her adult life locked in her Amherst bedroom, scratching out nearly 2,000 poems. She opens poem 657 with this provocative declaration: “I dwell in Possibility –  A fairer House than Prose –  More numerous of Windows –  Superior – for Doors –”. Bound up with this dreamy reclusion is Dickinson’s refusal of marriage, even to the man she was evidently in love with. Withdrawn into the quiet repose of her locked room, “doing nothing”, she can venture infinitely further and more boldly than a woman bounded by the obligations and conventions of 19th century marriage.The first year of my PhD was a time of increasing anxiety and depressive drift. The illusion of complete daily freedom was fun only for as long as I could forget that I was supposed to be doing something. The growing pile of books and scholarly journals induced in me not productive urgency but debilitating paralysis. I was rescued, not for the first time in my life, by a movie: Richard Linklater’s 1991 Slacker, which I watched enraptured in the back row seat of a sticky floored fleapit.It didn’t take me long to see the aimlessness of my own life reflected in the funhouse mirror of Linklater’s film, comprised of weird, randomly connected episodes from the makeshift subcultures of Austin, Texas, teeming with amateur metaphysicians, tinkerers, petty criminals, anarchists and poseurs, linked only by their uncompromising renunciation of “the kind of work you have to do to earn a living”.The film’s title seemed to allude less to its characters than to itself, to its own slack relationship to its subjects, at once fascinated and distracted, alive and lackadaisical. Watching Slacker opened up a different way of relating to my own life, one that wasn’t measured and valued by externally imposed targets and achievements. It offered a glimpse of what Roland Barthes called “idiorrhythmy”, “where each subject lives according to his own rhythm”. To live life as a slacker means to refuse the regimentation of time and space by the impersonal forces of work and leisure, giving yourself over to the pace and style of the impulses, curiosities and desires unique to you. But it’s equally a social ideal, whereby the rhythms of all our inidual lives co-exist without encroaching on each other.No doubt there comes a time when your idiorrhythm can no longer be isolated from everyone else’s, when it must reckon with the externally imposed rhythms of an institutional day or the competing idiorrhythms of lovers or children or pets. But surely this is when it’s most important to keep hold of its spirit of indiscipline, its commitment to activity, and inactivity, without purpose or aim.Perhaps all of us, not least the good citizens and hard workers, have much to learn from the slacker and her counterparts. If we allow our whole selves to be absorbed by the demands and agendas of a persecutory to-do list scribbled by others, we will quickly lose the very dimension of life that makes it worth living.• Not Working by Josh Cohen is published by Granta.

There are 11 so far ranging across fiction and non-fiction and she is particularly taken with an Odyssey-based memoir by Daniel Mendelsohn, which points out that, for all its derring-do, the Homeric epic revolves around a bed (the one to which Odysseus returns and Penelope has kept warm, accepting him back as her husband only when he recognises it as “a living tree”).Barker’s contribution to this growing subgenre is The Silence of the Girls, which looks at Homer’s other epic, the Iliad, from the vantage point of the enslaved Trojan queen, Briseis. One of four books in contention for the Costa novel of the year, and with a film deal just signed, it has been widely acclaimed as a triumphant departure from her familiar stamping grounds of the first and second world wars. “It’s the first time I’ve had a group of women sitting together over a dish of wine talking about what men are like in bed,” she says. To put it bluntly (as Barker’s women do), Agamemnon prefers “the back gate” and Achilles is “quick”.The novel is set during the siege of Troy, as the Greek army builds up to its final assault, surrounded by the “sex slaves” captured in its previous victories. Though the story hasn’t been updated in any overt way, her Greek and Trojan women are gossiping all around us in the homely north of England pub. As she says of her characters: “They are very north-eastern – and why not? It’s about toughness, irreverence, humour and bitterness all thrown in together.”Take away the bitterness, and the 75-year-old novelist could be describing herself. “In my personal life I think you’d say there have been a number of prominent women,” she says. It was the storytelling of her working-class grandmother and great-aunts that taught her about the richness of contested history. “They would argue passionately. One sister believed her father was a drunkard, another believed equally strongly that he never touched a drop.”But as she thinks on, she wonders if something more profound might be going on too. “You could also say that as people get near their end they return to the beginning. It’s a way of trying to make sense of their experience, but that raises the question of what we are coming to the end of.” Half of her 14 novels have dealt with the fallout from the first and second world wars. “You could argue, and perhaps it is true, that time’s up: we’re at the end of patriarchy, and I’m fine with that as long as it’s remembered that among the victims of patriarchy the vast majority are men.”Brought up “on the pancrack” (national assistance) on Teesside by her beloved grandmother, her personal experience of the domestic catastrophe of warfare was fortuitously limited. Her step-grandfather had a bayonet wound from the first world war and her father “is supposed to have died in the second world war, though I don’t think anybody can be sure what happened because nobody knew who he was. But my mother always presented herself as a widow because it was a terrible shame to have a child without a father.”Elinor’s letter turns out to foreshadow her latest book to an uncanny extent. Describing what it is like in London’s once glamorous Café Royal, which she and Paul used to haunt with their art school set, she writes: “Now it’s full of frightened old men who think their day is over (and they’re probably right) and overexcited young men who jabber till the spit flies, though it’s only stuff they’ve read in the paper. The women have gone very quiet. It’s like the Iliad, you know, when Achilles insults Agamemnon and Agamemnon says he’s got to have Achilles’ girl and Achilles goes off and sulks by the long ships and the girls they’re quarrelling over say nothing, not a word … I don’t suppose men ever hear that silence.”A paradox of The Silence of the Girls is that Barker’s excavation of that silence has brought her back to the loquacious, female-centred worldview of her earliest work. Union Street (1982), Blow Your House Down (1984) and The Century’s Daughter (1986) were all set in the north-east and published by the feminist imprint Virago. By the end of the decade she was feeling claustrophobic, complaining that she “had got myself into a box where I was strongly typecast as a northern, regional, working class, feminist – label, label, label – novelist”. Particularly irksome to her was the recurrent question of whether she could write men – “as though that were some kind of Everest”.Her response was to leave Virago and begin work on her name-making Regeneration trilogy, which recentred her reputation in the predominantly male arena of warfare – “or more generally speaking violence, because there’s criminal violence in my work and some domestic violence too, though basically it’s about the trauma of war”. Published in 1991, Regeneration wasn’t the immediate hit it is often now assumed to have been, she points out – “most overnight successes in literature took 20 years’ hard slog” – but the second novel, The Eye in the Door, won her the  fiction award and the third, The Ghost Road, scooped the 1995 Booker prize.One of the strengths of her war writing is the unflinching eye she brings to its bodily horrors. Her novels are full of hospitals in which wounded soldiers struggle with psychological and physical mutilation. In Life Class a soldier’s attempt to kill himself leaves “his left eyeball swinging against his cheek” in The Silence of the Girls, wounds “crackle” with gangrene (a symptom you can find today on the NHS website). But she is quick to give Homer his due: “The violence is incredibly accurately described. I do believe that late in the formation of these stories there was a single mind reshaping them and it was a mind that was very familiar with the inside of the human body: with the kidneys, the liver. He could only have learned that on the battlefield.”Barker’s search for a female perspective brought her to the realisation that “of course the young men who died were husbands – and, particularly poignantly, sons”. She gifted to Briseis her belief that the stories of “common women whose names you won’t have heard” can humanise history by recalling the childhood foibles of dead heroes or the long labours their mothers suffered giving birth to them.All the same, it was a challenge to maintain interest in the men without breaking faith with Briseis’s chilling insight that the alienation between the warriors and their captives was so complete that “A slave isn’t a person who’s being treated as a thing. A slave is a thing.” To do so, Barker counterpoints Achilles’ contempt for his concubine with his love for his foster brother, Patroclus. Their relationship is sensuously drawn. Are they gay lovers? “I have no hang-ups about writing about gay relationships, as readers of The Eye in the Door will remember, but I didn’t want their relationship to be sweaty buttocks in a tent because I think it’s much more interesting than that. There’s a presexual bond and also they’re brothers in arms, which can be very passionate, though it’s not spoken about in those terms.”Any criticism of the novel has tended to centre on the credibility of her feminised perspective, particularly with regard to Helen, who has a spiky cameo as a style icon contemptuous of less beautiful women’s attempts to copy her eye makeup, and whose tapestries – full of men “gutted, skewered, filleted” – are described as “a way of saying: I’m here. Me. A person, not just an object to be looked at and fought over.” Barker is fiercely dismissive of such quibbles, insisting, “All the anachronisms are deliberate.” Her soldiers are prone to breaking out in bawdy ballads when drunk, “and I keep having to explain that I don’t exactly believe that Homeric warriors were singing English rugby songs either”. What, she asks, does it mean to say a character who never existed was anachronistic? “You can be anachronistic about Elizabeth I but not about Helen.”In the Trojan war as in many others, she points out, it is women who survive, even if their voices are not reported. “It’s women who carry the can long-term not exclusively – some men become carers for their wounded sons – but mostly it’s women, long after the politicians have forgotten.” This brings us to the great and enduring subject of doomed youth, which leaves a devastating trail through millennia of warfare and has particular resonance today, a century after the great slaughter of the first world war.As a remain voter in a strongly pro-Brexit area, she is clear that “one side of the immense battiness of Brexit is the young feeling they’ve been done out of something by the old, which is almost more worrying than the ision between London and the rest of the country, although that is also extremely deep.” A beneficiary of free education – who went from grammar school to study international history at the London School of Economics and on to a teaching job before getting her first novel published at the age of 40 – she is acutely aware of the betrayal of young people following behind her: “I doubt I’d be able to go to university today.” While she doesn’t consider herself to be a working-class writer, “in that I don’t write consciously of working-class experience in the way I once did, I always take pride in producing working-class characters who are not just there for light relief as they unforgivably are in many novels about the middle classes.”But one unexpected side-effect of the Brexit earthquake, she believes, is that it has woken up at least some movers and shakers to the dangers of a them-and-us society. “I think publishing is more and more interested in having regional voices. So it was a shock which has its salutary side.” More generally, she is optimistic that women are claiming joint ownership of a world to which they have historically been denied access. “So yes, I think in that sense time’s up. It gives me a reason to get up in the morning, as it should every woman.” • The Silence of the Girls is published by Hamish Hamilton.

Three days into the year and fat cat bosses have already made what average workers will earn all year.“It’s not fair, and it makes no sense in how we value people’s contribution to society and it makes no sense for the economy – I don’t know any care workers who squirrel their wages away in offshore accounts, they spend it in their local areas and on paying their bills.”Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, also slammed “greedy executives” she said were “taking more than they’ve earned”.“Too much wealth is being hoarded at the top,” she said, adding that reforms were needed to bring executive pay “back down to earth”.Shareholders have also taken aim at overpaid executives, with 63 companies including Royal Mail, Persimmon and Unilever facing investor rebellions over pay last year.“This is a result of shareholders feeling they are not being listened to,” said Andrew Ninian, the Investment Association’s director of stewardship and corporate governance.“Companies need to do more to respond to shareholder concerns and ensure pay rewards align with company performance and remain at levels that are justifiable to shareholders.”A £75m bonus pocketed by the boss of Persimmon, Jeff Fairburn, eventually resulted in his ousting in November following an earlier investor backlash.The CIPD and the High Pay Centre are calling for a major overhaul of how executive pay is set in the UK.The two bodies say corporate remuneration committees, which decide executive pay levels within each company, should be more erse in terms of gender, ethnicity and professional background in order to combat group-think.They are also calling for long-term incentive plans, which tend to dole out performance-based bonuses every three years, to be replaced with a less complex system based on a basic salary and a small restricted share award.Executive performance should also be based on benchmarks including employee wellbeing and workforce training, which the High Pay Centre and CIPD say are “crucial for good corporate governance”.CIPD’s chief executive, Peter Cheese, said: “Excessive pay packages awarded by remuneration committees represent a significant failure in corporate governance and perpetuate the idea of a ‘superstar’ business leader when business is a collective endeavour and reward should be shared more fairly.“This imbalance does nothing to help heal the many social and economic ides facing the country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de78498cf2f9c2b35457d2a5009f76fe73ddb171/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f994ac20e88d84e527b90a3a121079ac","title":"european markets rebound as uk investors await services data business live","story":"Growth in UK and US in focus after new year fears rattle marketsNon-farm payrolls data show the US economy added 312,000 jobs in December – far higher than the 177,000 expected by economists.At the top of the agenda for investors (although not necessarily for Powell) will be the recent market sell-off – spurred in part by fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy too much, making a dreaded policy mistake.Financial markets anticipate zero chance of a rate hike during 2019 following the stock market moves, with thoughts turning to a possible loosening of policy if the economy shows further signs of a downturn.Dean Popplewell, a vice president at spreadbetter Oanda, asks:With the market pricing out any Fed hikes for this year, will a strong non-farm payrolls print see dealers reversing their decision that the Fed is ready to abandon its rate hike plans when employment growth is still so strong?The US jobs data, the non-farm payrolls, can be a major market-moving event because of its implications on the Federal Reserve’s thinking.Traders are getting a double helping today, with Fed chair Jerome Powell due to speak on a panel with his predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, at the American Economic Association in Georgia.But first, at 1:30pm GMT, non-farms from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists’ consensus expectations point to 177,000 new jobs added in December, up from 155,000 in November.However, separate data from private-sector payroll provider ADP yesterday came in much higher than expected, prompting questions on whether an upside surprise is coming.Less than half an hour to go until US jobs data, and American stock futures show markets remain on track for gains today.Parliament may not be back until next week, but if you can’t wait for your political fix then John Goldie, a foreign exchange dealer at Argentex, has been gaming the scenarios.However, on the basis that not much has changed since May was forced to pull a vote on the deal last month, if a vote is held and lost in the coming weeks it could do serious damage to sterling, which is currently trading up today at about $1.2677 against the US dollar and €1.1104 against the euro.The next step would be to request extension to Article 50, says Goldie:Most likely this would be accepted by the EU27 (they would be more than happy for the possibility of No Brexit At All), and we move towards new votes: an election or referendum. GBPEUR would likely remain range bound for the foreseeable future, though perhaps a return to 1.13-1.15 range. GBPUSD would go back to 1.30 if we’re lucky, but any further move higher would be very much dollar-dependent.However, it has to be unanimous. If an extension were rejected, this is the route to a full, clean, No Deal exit – by default – through failing to agree and ratify terms within the Article 50 timeframe. This situation would bring about our current predictions of 1.19 and 1.00 against the dollar and the euro respectively.” Eurozone inflation data from this morning is certainly giving economists something to think about, as lower oil prices threaten to derail the European Central Bank’s gradual tightening of monetary policy.Mario Draghi, the ECB’s president, staked the move to end stimulative asset purchases on rising inflation in the Eurozone.The data show that higher wages still have not translated into core inflation, said Bert Colijn, an economist at ING.If the economic situation continues to worsen, it could be that higher wages don’t translate into significantly higher core inflation for the months ahead, although some upward movement can be expected.We’re coming up to midday on Friday 4 January. For the average FTSE 100 chief executive that means they have almost earned the same amount during 2019 as the average British worker will throughout the whole year.Calculations by the High Pay Centre thinktank and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) show top executives are earning 133 times more than the average worker, at a rate of around £1,020 per hour or £3.9m annually, writes Kalyeena Makortoff.Stock markets across the EU have rebounded from yesterday’s losses as a more positive mood takes hold thanks in part to the announcement trade talks between China and the US.The new talks between Beijing and Washington will take place next week at the vice ministerial level, raising hopes that the trade war started by President Donald Trump will be eased.The People’s Bank of China has also eased the reserve requirement ratio for banks, indicating its willingness to stimulate the economy if there is a slowdown.Gaurav Saroliya, head of global macro strategy at Oxford Economics, argues that the recent market downturns have been driven more by sentiment than fundamentals, although “bulls are lacking propulsion”. He added:The sell-off in equities and other risk assets, fueled by multiple worries such as growth slowdown, higher rates, lack of supportive policy catalysts and geopolitical headwinds, smacks of an overreaction.It’s looking like a more positive day on Wall Street. Futures are pointing to a rebound after yesterday’s Apple-inspired pain.The sell-off yesterday was steep, but there were also reminders that the US economy is still growing and there is still activity. For instance, pharma company Bristol-Myers Squibb pulled off a truly giant deal for biotech rival Celgene – $74bn in cash and stock, topping $90bn when debt is included.British consumer credit growth has also slowed, according to more bellwether data for the UK economy published today.The growth of borrowing from households has been slowing in recent months, in part because double-digit annual growth in debt was unsustainable at a time when broader economic growth was weak. However, unwillingness for consumers to take on more debt when uncertainties abound has also been highlighted by economists.Mortgage approvals also fell to a seven-month low, the Bank said, adding to the picture of a gloomy housing market.City economists are split over whether to trust the measly picture of the British economy given by the services data.However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says the weak new orders balance and pessimistic outlook from businesses point to further tepid growth. He said: The continued weakness of the business activity index in December adds to evidence that the economy effectively has ground to a halt, primarily due to mounting concerns about Brexit.A quick glance at this graph from IHS MarkitCIPS shows that the sector is not expanding at the pace seen in most months since the global financial crisis.Employment growth has also weakened as firms hold back. The statement from IHS MarkitCIPS said:New work increased only marginally during December, which contributed to a slowdown in job creation to its weakest since July 2016.Sterling and the FTSE 100 are stable after the services PMI release – which was broadly in line with expectations.However, IHS Markit describe it as a “subdued end to 2018”, as business activity rose at one of the slowest rates since the Brexit vote.November’s data had been a 20-month low, so while the pick-up was greater than expected, the survey points to uncertainty holding back activity.The services sector is “showing worrying signs of having lost steam amid intensifying Brexit anxiety”, according to Chris Williamson, the IHS Markit economist. He said:The final two months of 2018 saw the weakest back-to-back expansions of business activity since late-2012 and highlight how clarity on Brexit is needed urgently in order to prevent the economy sliding into contraction.The British services sector accelerated slightly in December, bucking expectations of a slowdown.The closely followed purchasing managers index rose to 51.2, up from 50.4 in November, according to data firm IHS Markit.Economists had expected a reading of 50.7, according to a poll ahead of the data."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/918e29eb1f20435b0e7ede1af31700c81d61d8ff/0_25_5565_3339/master/5565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9b5a61a73260024063ba9eb0b39af4d","title":"invisible irish border crucial support backstop brexit northern ireland","story":"Life has become pretty normal for most people in Northern Ireland over the past 20 years or so. Like anyone else in the UK, people go to jobs near to them or in the next town. They go to doctors, chemists and hospitals near to them. They buy local fresh food. They use trains, buses and roads to get around.But if we in Britain get Brexit wrong, our friends in Northern Ireland will find all of these things harder to do. Why? Because of the border with Ireland, which is crossed 110 million times a year as people on either side go about their daily lives.People live on one side of that border and work on the other. Because of European Union rules that the UK helped make, cancer care and ambulance services are run jointly across that border. You can get a prescription on one side and your medicines on the other because of more EU rules we share. Cheaper energy and more choice across Ireland is there – again, thanks to those common rules.Most vital of all is that these things all add up to making life feel normal, when just 20 years ago the Good Friday agreement all but finished the violence and murder which killed thousands of people, including many in Britain. The border being invisible today is a big part of that peace process. We can’t let Northern Ireland go backwards by putting up any new barriers.We don’t believe the prime minister’s Brexit deal is in the best interests of anyone in the UK, and we will vote against it. But as former secretaries of state for Northern Ireland, we do believe that if Brexit really has to happen, there must be a deal – and that no deal is reckless madness.Nowhere is this more important than in Northern Ireland. So while we oppose Theresa May’s deal, we cannot and will not join those attacking what is known as the backstop.Backstop seems a bad word now to some, but it shouldn’t be. It’s an insurance policy, a rainy-day backup plan in case a new UK-EU trade deal isn’t ready by the end of 2020 – or beyond. It is a sensible policy to be used only if needed (and everyone hopes it won’t be) to ensure the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland remains open and invisible.The UK and Irish governments, along with the EU, were right to prioritise the Irish border in the Brexit negotiations. Our UK parliament has rightly focused on it too, setting in the EU Withdrawal Act a firm commitment to no new border infrastructure.Any Brexit deal of any kind must include this insurance policy or backstop. It’s not just that Ireland or the EU won’t accept it any other way we in the UK shouldn’t either.It is such a pity so many politicians and journalists have become obsessed by words like “backstop”, taking away from the fact that this is about people, their lives and their livelihoods. A little-noticed document published in December by the Department for Exiting the European Union lists no less than 157 different areas of cross-border work and co-operation in Ireland, north and south, many of these facilitated by EU laws. They include food safety, tourism, schools, colleges, farming, fighting crime, tackling environmental pollution, water quality and supply, waste management, blood transfusions and so on.Whatever happens with Brexit, it is vital we protect what we’ve achieved in Northern Ireland together in the last 20-30 years – and avoid any hardening of the border in any way. When parliament returns from the Christmas recess on Monday, we call on our fellow politicians, including the DUP, to stop playing politics with Northern Ireland and insist on an insurance policy over the border.• Paul Murphy and Peter Hain served as secretaries of state for Northern Ireland successively between 2002 and 2007"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c07f406a10781aef666788aeafe4a1d71752d34e/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b7d16d50c3eae9d84a9d7cb458f23a1","title":"what to see this week in the uk","story":"From The Favourite to Life in the Dark, here’s our pick of the best films, concerts, exhibitions, theatre and dance over the next seven daysby  Andrew Pulver,  Michael Cragg,  John Fordham,  Andrew Clements,  Jonathan Jones,  Mark Cook and  Lyndsey WinshipThree great performances – from Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone – ballast this brilliant fable of jostling power brokers at the 18th-century court of Queen Anne.

Consistently named as one of the most scenic drives in the world, this route from Calgary to Edmonton through the Rockies is hard to beatWith a flourishing bar and dining scene, and a number of erse and arty neighbourhoods, cosmopolitan, multicultural Calgary is much more than just the gateway to the Rockies. Direct flights from London (daily from Heathrow, and multiple times a week from Gatwick) also make it a convenient starting point. Load-up and learn, with a food tour of the historic Inglewood neighbourhood. The tour stops at the high-end Rouge, in what’s now a heritage site, as well as taking in Alberta’s First Nations arts and food culture.Style-up and get your cowboy threads sorted year-round at the Alberta Boot Company, or head to Smithbilt for the distinctive white hats that have become a symbol of the city – so that when the Calgary Stampede rodeo comes to town in July, you look the part.Head for the hills to start your roadtrip. Banff national park – Canada’s oldest – is an easy hour-and-a-half drive from Calgary. But don’t skip the picturesque and vibrant mountain town of Canmore, just outside the park’s boundary, where the peaks of the Rockies provide the backdrop to numerous music and arts festivals throughout the year.For a town with a population of just under 14,000 people, the town is overflowing with dining and drinking destinations. And it also claims the honour of being home to the largest number of Olympians per capita in Canada, who use the altitude to train. (If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.)In the summer, hit the bike trails. A 13-mile trail connects to Banff, with an additional 50 miles of other pathways to follow. In winter, try out one of the newest crazes in these parts: fat biking. Extra-large tyres will take you across otherwise inaccessible snow-covered trails. Don’t fret, there are hand-warmers too. Afterwards, head on to Banff to warm-up at the thermal waters of the Upper Hot Springs.It’s impossible to be bored in Banff with the myriad activities on offer. If you want action and adventure, try white-water rafting, rock climbing and horse riding. If you want to take it easy, just find a patio, order a coffee and sit and watch the clouds move over the mountains that hug the town. If you want something in between, how about a round of golf? Banff has some of the most beautiful courses in the world. You certainly can’t skip town without a fondue from the unironically kitsch Grizzly House.Put simply, Lake Louise doesn’t look real. Its searing blue waters reflect back the towering glacier that created the lake 10,000 years ago. While in the winter the lake freezes over and becomes a fairy-tale setting for ice skaters and sleigh rides, in the summer it’s populated by canoes with travellers keen to glimpse the ice close-up. When you get tired of taking in the views from the genteel-surrounds of the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise – if such a thing is possible – take the steep 2-mile (3.5-km) hike from the hotel to the Disney-esque Lake Agnes Tea House. First built by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1901 as a shelter for hikers, this lakeshore log cabin sits in a valley of its own, and has been serving tea since 1905.The spectacularly scenic Icefields Parkway hugs hillsides and traces its way past more than 100 ancient glaciers on its 146-mile (235-km) route from Lake Louise to Jasper national park.With dramatic waterfalls and sweeping lakes at nearly every turn, you’re going to want to stop often. Head to the highest point of the parkway to stop at the viewpoint for the glowing turquoise waters of Peyto Lake.

Funding from the European Research Council (ERC) and Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions programme (MSCA) will be worth an estimated €1.3bn (£1.2bn) to the UK over the next two years, investing in projects to fight cancer and combat climate change.Dame Janet Beer, the president of Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, said time was running out.“While we welcome the assurances that the government has already provided about the continuation of Horizon 2020 funding in a no deal scenario, it is critical that similar guarantees are extended, without delay, to cover ERC and MSCA funding,” said Beer, who is vice-chancellor of the University of Liverpool.“Without cast-iron assurances, world-leading academics and researchers may leave for countries where access to ERC funding is not at risk, and those currently considering relocating to the UK may think again.”Dame Nancy Rothwell, the vice-chancellor of the University of Manchester, said vital research projects at her university risked being disrupted, including work on proton-beam therapy for cancer patients and Nobel-prize winning work on graphene.“Researchers who have already spent months or even years preparing funding bids would be left high and dry, including those whose application would be stuck in the middle of the evaluation process,” she said.Commenting on the EU student enrolment figures, Chandler said that although the Russell Group universities remained popular study destinations with strong global appeal, the figures cannot be ignored.“It’s fair to assume that uncertainty over Brexit and the UK’s future relationship with Europe could be a significant factor. The drop in postgraduate research courses is especially troubling – these students contribute directly to the UK’s research capacity,” she said.“If we leave the EU without a deal, the uncertainty felt by prospective European students will only get worse.”A UK Government spokesperson said: “Science recognises no borders and the UK has a proud record of welcoming the world’s leading scientists and researchers to work and study here. This will not change when we leave the EU.“Through our modern Industrial Strategy we are investing the highest ever level in research and development in UK history and we are committed to seeking an ambitious future relationship on science and innovation with our EU partners. We are also guaranteeing, in the event of a no deal, money for EU programme-funded research and innovation projects agreed before the end of 2020.”Shadow Higher and Further Education Minister Gordon Marsden added: “Despite consistent warnings from Labour and the University sector, the Government has continued to ignore the impending damage, especially the drift to no deal, Brexit could cause to our world class Universities and FE Colleges.“Today’s letter from the sector reiterated everything we have been saying over the past two years about the threats facing students, staff and research but DfE and the Education Secretary has been abysmally negligent in ensuring those concerns and a deal on them should be put at the top of the negotiations table.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11767d45ea370c695d9caeddf1c8edce1a7c015e/1043_4334_1991_1194/master/1991.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e25370de22b529b6152d251fd366f7f","title":"how to wear ankle boots jess cartner morley","story":"Interesting ankle boots turn a midi skirt or cropped trousers or jeans into an interesting lookI am starting to see what the Victorians meant about ankles. I have a bit of a thing for them myself these days. And it’s not just me: right now, they are a much-appreciated erogenous zone, sartorially speaking.Ah, excellent point. You’ve noticed that you can’t actually see my ankles. But here’s the thing: you can see that I have ankles. Bear with me. What I mean is that you might notice my ankles, even though you can’t see them, because my skirt is of a length that shows ankle, rather than leg, so it points to these rather eye-catching boots. If I had been wearing this skirt five years ago, I would probably have worn it with dark-coloured high heels, because it wouldn’t have occurred to me to make ankles a focal point but in 2019 it calls for a jazzy ankle boot.The jazzy ankle boot is one of those trends that started as a silly fling and, against the odds, stuck. It stuck because it is simple and effective. My absolute favourite fashion tricks are the kind that are big on impact but don’t make your life difficult. A well-chosen pair of spectacular earrings, for instance: they fit into your handbag, and turn a black sweater and jeans into a passable evening look. A pair of interesting ankle boots with a modest heel works along the same lines. They transform a midi skirt, or trousers or jeans cropped at the ankle, into an interesting look.The ankle boot has risen as hemlines have fallen. An ankle boot is not particularly flattering, so when skirts were short and leg-lengthening illusions were called for, it didn’t really work. But when your skirt shows only a few inches of ankle, there is really no need to get hung up on leg-lengthening illusions. (There was never actually any point getting hung up on leg-lengthening illusions in the first place but most of us feel those pressures and I don’t think it’s helpful to pretend we don’t.)It is not only skirts that have a new hemline. Trouser length has changed, too. It used to be that trousers were worn as long as possible without touching the ground, covering as much of the shoe as possible, stretching out the leg and disappearing the ankle. But the toe of a shoe pointing out from your hem doesn’t look quite right now. A hem that lands on or a bit above your ankle is the thing. A jazzy ankle boot slots into that gap nicely. It doesn’t need to colour-match with your bag or clothes, so one pair will work for most outfits. Try a pair. You may find yourself smitten.Styling: Melanie Wilkinson.

A month on, no new host has been announced.In DeGeneres, an openly gay two-times Oscars host held in huge public affection, Hart has a formidable champion. On the show, sections of which were released by DeGeneres ahead of the full broadcast on Monday, she says she has been in touch with the Academy to back Hart, that she suspects they hope he will return, and that she is “praying for that to happen”.Interviewer and interviewee concur that the chief problem lies not with Hart but with those who unearthed the tweets in question, from 2008, in the wake of his appointment.Hart describes this as “a malicious attack on my character … an attack to end me”. He continues: “This was to destroy me, to end all partnerships, all brand relationships, all investment opportunities, studio relationships, my production company and the people that work underneath me.“This was to damage the lives that have been invested in me. It’s bigger than just the Oscars, it’s about the iniduals that are out there now that are finding success and damaging your ‘celebrity’.”Hart’s homophobic remarks on Twitter included calling someone a “fat faced fag”, comparing a profile picture to a “gay bill board for AIDS” and frequent self-declarations as “no homo”.One 2010 standup routine includes an extended riff in which Hart discusses trying to drum any hint of homosexuality out of his son. Many declared their distaste at Hart’s initial comments and what they saw as a lukewarm show of contrition.Speaking to the  about the incident, Steve McQueen – whose film 12 Years a Slave won the best picture Oscar in 2014 – said he thought Hart’s appointment had been made with an eye on falling telecast viewing figures, “but obviously somebody made a mistake”.On her show, DeGeneres tells Hart that “there are so many haters out there” and urges him to “be the bigger man”. She goes on: “It’s a small group of people being very, very loud. We are a huge group of people who love you and want to see you host the Oscars.”Hart indicates he would be eager to consider returning to what he has previously described as his “dream job” on crusading grounds: “Somebody has to take a stand against the trolls.”Some Twitter users have taken issue with Hart and DeGeneres’s version of events, maintaining that the former’s apology remains half-hearted, and that the latter was speaking out of turn – or even betraying the gay community.A survey conducted at the end of 2018 by Spotted, a data and research provider focused on the celebrity endorsement space, suggested that the furore had barely dinted Hart’s appeal.“Kevin Hart has an uncanny ability to recover from scandal,” she said. “His ability to quickly rebound is directly correlated to how high he scores, pre-scandal. When a celebrity is so well-liked in the eyes of consumers, just like a mother’s favourite child, they can almost do no wrong.”Hart was booked to appear on Ellen to promote The Upside, a remake of French hit The Intouchables. Hart plays a drifter recently released from prison who becomes the carer of a paralysed billionaire (played by Bryan Cranston)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03a247fbae6b7a2167b0cf623fb641cf7f7b1046/0_0_5547_3328/master/5547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aae21b1b9876139bcbf6b93279c3b4ac","title":"steve coogan interview stan and ollie","story":"Why has one of Britain’s best-loved comedians decided to play it straight? The star of Stan \u0026amp Ollie talks about politics, his rivalry with Rob Brydon – and his inner Alan PartridgeIn 1953, Hollywood comedians Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy embarked on a farewell tour of the British music hall circuit, dragging their luggage from one provincial hotel to the next. They pulled pints for the cameras, judged a beauty pageant at Butlins and reprised slapstick routines from their 1930s two-reelers. The tour was a hit but it was tinged with sadness as well. There are few sights so poignant as the exhausted antics of an ageing clown.The trick, says Steve Coogan, is to keep moving, branch out. Aged 53, he feels that comedy, by and large, is a young man’s game. He has been there, he has done it, and is shifting towards drama. “It’s fine to be biting, acerbic and silly when you’re young,” he says. “But when you grow up you need to act like a grownup.” Then he catches himself and winces at his presumption. “Maybe that just means I’ve got flabby and middle aged.”The jury is still out but I think maturity suits him. Coogan’s reputation was forged during his hectic 90s heyday, when he carried himself like a Premier League footballer, the cocksure comic striker behind witless Alan Partridge. These days, the hair has gone grey while the roles have turned more knotty, nuanced and tender. He was deftly affecting in the Bafta-winning Philomena, thin-skinned and whip-smart in Michael Winterbottom’s The Trip, and he gives a lovely, limber performance in Stan \u0026amp Ollie, a bittersweet account of the duo’s swansong British tour.Coogan explains that he started his career doing the voices on Spitting Image, so impersonating Laurel came relatively easily (the diffident smile the precise, flat vowels). The hard part was digging behind the facade, revealing the man behind the screen image. But he is wary of sounding too precious about this God forbid he should come over all Daniel Day-Lewis. “I’ve never really been a method actor,” he scoffs. “I don’t think Mike Leigh would like me. If he wanted me to do a medieval melodrama, I’d still be wearing my underpants from Marks \u0026amp Spencer underneath my costume I don’t care what he says.”There is a cafetiere inside the hotel room. Coogan insists on playing mother. He pours the coffee with a flourish but then struggles with the milk, which comes in a little carton that must be pierced with a plastic straw. His angle is wrong the milk squirts out in a jet. For a brief, fleeting moment, he could be Partridge back at the Linton Travel Tavern.On screen, Laurel played gormless underling to Hardy’s finicky little king. Off screen, though, the roles were reversed. Laurel co-directed the pictures and devised the bulk of the gags. He was at once ringmaster and clown, the artist and the clay, to the point where it became difficult to spot where the man ended and the character began.On screen (and arguably off it, too) Laurel and Hardy were at once inseparable and at permanent loggerheads. They gave the impression of being as much tragic as funny, the inspiration for Vladimir and Estragon in Waiting for Godot. And at times Stan \u0026amp Ollie – directed by John S Baird with a script by Jeff Pope, Coogan’s co-writer on Philomena – feels more indebted to Samuel Beckett than to the comedy of Laurel and Hardy producer Hal Roach. It’s a dying fall of a film: a tale of dwindling resources and aching limbs and two men who suspect they are being edged inexorably towards the exit door. Coogan thinks that this is entirely as it should be.“It’s hard to make a comedy from success,” he explains. “The best ones are about failure and bad luck and inadequacy. And this film is about the transience of all the success that went before.” Another pause. “Do you know that film Anvil: The Story of Anvil? It’s a documentary about a heavy metal band and their glory days are behind them and they’re flat broke. And I don’t particularly like the music. In fact, I sort of hate it. But what I was really moved by was their affection and unfailing loyalty in middle age. It’s only as they get older that they realise they love each other.”I wonder if the same might be said of The Trip. If not a tale of failure, exactly, Michael Winterbottom’s sitcom, initially on BBC Two, now on Sky Atlantic, brilliantly exposes the limits of success, the fragility of the male ego and the bond between two sparring partners whose relationship is closer than they would care to admit. Coogan and Rob Brydon play versions of themselves: affluent, status-conscious performers, each vying for the upper hand. Coogan likes to dismiss Brydon as a middle-of-the-road entertainer, a reliable footsoldier on the panel-show circuit. Brydon, in turn, suggests that his rival is a 1990s timepiece, a hedonistic antique like “Oasis or cocaine”. The Trip is partly scripted, partly improvised. It’s a comedy fiction, but there’s a truth to it, too.Coogan pushes his spectacles back up the bridge of his nose. “I remember Rob once saying to me: ‘The trouble with you is that you’re not funny any more.’”Wait a minute … was this on camera or off? “God knows. It was in that sort of grey area in between. He was thinking: ‘What will really annoy Steve?’ And I remember thinking: ‘That’s not the worst thing you can say to me.’ I don’t think: ‘Oh my God, if I’m not funny my whole existence will crumble.’ It’s not my oxygen, being funny all the time. That’s a dysfunction. It’s just weird, to be honest. It would bother him more that’s probably why he said it.” He grimaces. “I mean, if someone said I was boring, that would bother me. But if I’m no longer funny, well, then I’ll do something not funny. There are a lot of other things to be.”For Stan Laurel, born in Lancashire and raised on music hall, the 1953 British tour was a homecoming of sorts. In his own way, Coogan is similarly circling back to his roots. He was born in Middleton, north of Manchester, to a large Irish Catholic family. He says that the older he gets, the more Irish he feels.“I’d like to claim I was a horny-handed son of toil,” he says. “But it was a more lower middle-class or upper working-class background.” His dad worked as an engineer for IBM the family was solidly socialist and prized education above all else. “I mean, we didn’t have a colour TV for such a long time. Even though the people on the council estate did have one and my grandmother got one straight away from Radio Rentals. So we didn’t have a colour telly, but we did have the Encyclopaedia Britannica. And so we were very aspirational as a family. There was this notion that, all being well, all of us kids would eventually end up as teachers.”By his early 20s, however, Coogan was already earning a decent living as a voiceover artist and standup comic. He joined the ensemble cast of Radio 4 comedy On the Hour (which subsequently morphed into BBC Two’s The Day Today) and won the Perrier award at the 1992 Edinburgh festival fringe. He became hugely successful at an indecently young age. I’m guessing his showbiz lifestyle made him the black sheep of the family, but he says that this was never really the case.“In terms of my profession, there was a precedent on my father’s side. My grandfather ran a dancehall in the 50s for Irish immigrants, when they were subject to the same prejudice as Jews and black people. You know, it was the era of ‘No blacks, dogs or Irish’. There was a certain ghettoisation in Manchester back then. Middleton had a lot of Irish people and it was right next door to Prestwich, which had a lot of Jewish people. But also, Catholicism isn’t puritanism. Catholicism allows you to get drunk and have a nice time. And if you’re from a working-class background, you’re expected to sing for your supper. Everybody does a turn. So it wasn’t that me being a performer was frowned upon. Quite the opposite, in fact.”The way Coogan tells it, his career has been shaped by an ongoing creative friction, even a niggling uncertainty about exactly what kind of artist he aspired to be. During the course of his career, he has bounced between what he refers to as his “Manchester gang” (Caroline Aherne, Jon Thomson, Craig Cash) and the “Oxbridge gang” (Armando Iannucci, Patrick Marber, Chris Morris) between big, bland Hollywood fodder and small, smart British productions. Partridge, I suspect, provides the man with his lynchpin: a popular character who has been allowed the space to take on a finer texture. Coogan says that he still loves to play Partridge and still laughs when he watches his antics on screen.So he’s basically saying he laughs at his own jokes? “Well, yeah,” he says, briefly rattled. “Because I don’t see it when I’m doing it. So when I watch it back in the editing suite, I feel the same delight as the audience would. I see Alan as Alan. I don’t see him as me.”During his 20s and 30s, Coogan was a favourite tabloid pinata. We thrilled to tales of how he liked nothing better than to snort rails of cocaine and then have sex with lap dancers. These days, he is a more sober, thoughtful figure, banging the drum for press regulation and writing op-eds calling for a second EU referendum. The change has been so striking it feels like a reinvention. I can’t quite work him out. Has Coogan grown more serious with age? Or was he always like this but elected to hide it?“I don’t know,” he says. “I think I’ve always had a political dimension. My family was political. I remember being told that Jesus was a socialist. But I was also very ambitious. And I started earning a lot of money early on. And I became apolitical. I thought: ‘Oh, sod all that.’ And it went to my head. It was like a sort of delayed adolescence.” Another pause: “But then you realise that all this stuff is transient and that you’re middle aged and that one day you’re going to be dead. And so you might as well make an effort to engage in some way.”I last met him when Philomena came out back in 2013. Back then, Coogan was a bracing, combative interviewee. He saw every question as a potential ambush and moved to thwart any perceived journalistic angle. Today, though, he seems more comfortable with the process, more at ease with himself. It used to be that he felt he always had to have his guard up. Now he accepts that he can sometimes afford to let it drop. He’s middle aged and a mass of insecurity and contradictions. He suspects that, on balance, that’s not such a terrible thing to be.“And actually I think acknowledging your own fallibility makes you a better artist and a better person,” he says in a rush. “It’s fairly obvious to me that the real wisdom lies in seeing people’s failings and trying to understand them. Because the alternative is that very childlike, Donald Trump thing of believing that admitting any weakness is fatal. What was it Bukowski said? All the clever people are full of self-doubt and all the stupid people are very confident. That’s the era we’re living in now. That’s the era I don’t want to be a part of. So all you can do is try to go about things differently. Do interesting work and don’t be a cunt.”Coogan gulps for breath. His eyes widen and then he rocks with laughter. “There you go, that’s my big artistic statement,” he says. “Do interesting work and don’t be a cunt. Took me the best part of an hour. Got there in the end.”Stan \u0026amp Ollie is in UK cinemas on 11 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fdea6d5335935c137f566720e2e554e5525f650/201_0_1799_1080/master/1799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71a3b9db00ba8b23568341659e9dec87","title":"anna jones recipe vegetable stew cheese dumplings celeriac apple soup spicy nuts","story":"Two ways with celeriac: a root vegetable stew with cheesy dumplings and a soup topped with a sprinkling of spicy nutsCeleriac is a bit of a beast to look at, but looks aren’t everything.

I turn to celeriac in these winter months we eat it shaved thinly and raw in salads with a mustardy dressing, cut it into steaks brushed with herbs and griddled, and sometimes roasted whole. Here, though, I use it as the base for a stew with the surprise hit of some cheddar-spiked dumplings on top. It’s also the star of this simple soup, topped with a dukkah-style spicy nut sprinkle, elevating it to something I’d eat any day of the week.

Add two tablespoons of very cold water, and use your hands to bring the dumpling mixture together into a nice dough – if it looks dry, add a few drops more water. Roll the dumplings into 12 balls.Once the stew is ready – the vegetables should be soft and yielding, the wine reduced – stir in the beans. Brush the dumplings with egg yolk, if you like, then put them on top of the stew, leaving a little room in between for them to increase in size.

It was a final for us, because lose and it was almost over – the title defence. If we lose it is almost done, it would be so difficult. But we are four points behind them and they are the leaders. We have to fight a lot but this gives us a lot of confidence.“The game was a real game for both sides. We beat an incredible team. We were outstanding from the first minute. We are happy for this victory to reduce the gap. Everything is open. Now it is tight again. Now we can rest and relax. I don’t remember a league so tough, there are so many huge contenders fighting for the title. Every game is a final.”“They had periods where they dominated the game and everybody felt the intensity but we came back and had big chances. It is always like this. You have to score in those moments. When Agüero scores there is no angle. In similar situations we didn’t score.“It was not our or City’s best game, because we both made it difficult for the other team. I have already said to the boys this is OK. We lost it but it will happen. Tonight it is not nice but it is not the biggest problem.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68ea9b8ac8d4de434a3ae138a52de9b2b7466f97/0_72_2229_1337/master/2229.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7881dd0c52f5391a41e6b070ff0905fe","title":"liverpool manchester city brush off disappointment defeat","story":"The world moves on.

Perhaps the technology is not perfect. Perhaps the reading that said the ball was 11.7 millimetres from completely crossing the line is affecting an impossible level of accuracy, but it is still much more likely to be right than a 41-year‑old former footballer from Baku.11.7mm. It is the length of a bluebottle, the thickness of a pocket diary, the width of the nail on a little finger. It is nothing on which to lose a football match, still less perhaps a championship. There is a danger now that the measurement comes to haunt Liverpool as surely as Steven Gerrard’s “This does not slip” speech after another game against Manchester City that when the history of this long title drought is written, the measurement 11.7mm looms so large that every time Liverpool fans see a fly, check an appointment or catch a glimpse of their own hands they are reminded of defeat and failure.But Liverpool are still four points clear, a fact Jürgen Klopp was understandably keen to emphasise, and the tightness of the margins perhaps serve as a useful reminder that football, even at the highest level, is often chaos. However much you plan and organise, there are certain games that are decided, depending how much agency you wish to credit players with, on the whims of fate or by tiny details in the moment. Sadio Mané’s shot hit the post and bounced out Leroy Sané’s was a fraction nearer the centre of the goal and so hit the post and cannoned in. This was a game won not in the macro but in the micro.That 11.7mm could have a huge impact. It may be that Liverpool can brush off the disappointment. It may be that the sting of defeat elevates them to yet greater heights. But there is a danger that when that 11.7mm is added to the accumulated history of the past 29 years, the pressure becomes intolerable, that the hope and anxiety and hysteria become too much. This is a test, more than anything, of Klopp as a psychologist and a motivator. Looked at coldly, beyond the result, the signs on Thursday for Liverpool were good.The one tactical frustration for Liverpool, perhaps, would be how lacking in inspiration their midfield three looked early in the second half once they had to chase the game – and it is probably significant that the three of Jordan Henderson, James Milner and Georginio Wijnaldum had looked equally unimaginative in the second half of the defeat away to Paris Saint-Germain.The shift to a 4-2-3-1 opened the game up, in part perhaps because Fernandinho suddenly had a direct opponent in Roberto Firmino, but also because Mohamed Salah moved more centrally, away from the flank where Aymeric Laporte, a conservative selection at left-back from Pep Guardiola, had done a fine job of marshalling him. Again the lesson is clear for teams playing City: if they are prepared to risk humiliation, pushing a forward high against Fernandinho disrupts City’s rhythm.City are not the relentless machine of the autumn. They look more human now, more fragile. Yet the gap is down to four points and the sense is that momentum is with them. The lead, though, is still with Liverpool thanks to their extraordinary December. All else being equal a four-point lead should still be decisive but, as Sir Alex Ferguson would always say, what matters most is less a defeat than the reaction to it.Defeats happen, even to the best sides, even by the finest margins. What Klopp has to do now is ensure that 11.7mm does not become a millstone, an eternal measure on Merseyside of the gap between aspiration and actuality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a663c1c94cba5470d96772d4a11038bed24e23ac/0_84_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f7bc8157e5ba0c4efd7e449d2fd0904","title":"football weekly extra extra manchester city liverpool","story":"Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Philippe Auclair discuss a classic Premier League humdinger at the Etihad, the 11 millimetres which may decide the title, another big move between Chelsea and Germany and Santi CazorlaJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

The 20-year-old, whose breakthrough to the first team last season is chronicled in the Netflix docuseries Sunderland Til I Die, has bagged 14 goals for the League One side this season, seven more than the club’s next most prolific scorer, Aiden McGeady. This, from Stewart Donald, the head of the consortium that bought the club last May. Maja is rumoured to have been offered seven times his current salary to stay at the club. Lend us your ears: Because last night’s match between Manchester City and Liverpool was the biggest, most important game in the history of the Premier League, Max Rushden, Lars Sivertson, Philippe Auclair and yours truly convened in the studio this morning to pick over the bones of the contest. Here’s what we thought ...Sean Dyche speaks: And Burnley’s manager has been warning his players against complacency on the back of their recent two-match winning ... em, streak, as they prepare to face Barnsley in the FA Cup tomorrow afternoon.“It’s been tough, but you can’t guarantee that momentum remains purely because it’s literally game after game. There’s no guarantee on that. We want to re-focus on this game. It’s important. We want to keep that mentality and that winning mentality is a really important thing.”Burnley had won only once in 12 games when they beat West Ham 2-0 last Sunday, and coming from behind to win at Huddersfield on Wednesday evening only increased the level of confidence within the dressing room.“It’s been difficult,” said Dyche. “It’s been tricky over the last few months, but I think the feel has remained the same and there’s been a good feel and a solid feel to the group in the mentality. But nothing reinforces it more than wins, of course, because that’s what footballers live for. They live to win games - that’s part of their lives - as do I as a manager, as do my staff and of course the fans as well. Without any doubt, when you are winning, it does add that edge of confidence to what you are trying to do.”Burnley will be without the suspended Robbie Brady following his red card in midweek, but could welcome back goalkeeper Nick Pope, defender Stephen Ward and midfielder Steven Defour from injury, with Dyche indicating he is likely to use the depth of his squad. “We have got a more competitive group now and the team that we put out, I think, can win games and particularly this game,” he said. “But they have got to deliver a performance.” David Moyes to Stoke City? Speculation continues to mount that David Moyes is on the verge of being appointed manager of Stoke City, with the Potters’ current boss, Gary Rowett, expected to be sacked following a poor run of form in which his side have won just one of their past five games.Jonny Williams signs for Charlton: The Crystal Palace and Wales midfielder has signedMore post-match reaction: Our video team have been slaving over this clip of selected highlights from Pep and Jürgen’s post-match press conferences, in which the Liverpool manager, unlike his Manchester City counterpart demonstrates that he has never learned that if you wear your coat, hat and scarf indoors, then you won’t feel the benefit of them when you go outside. Andy Robertson has been talking: Considered a pre-match doubt last night as his girlfriend was due to give birth to the couple’s second child, Liverpool defender Andy Robertson eventually lined up and played very well in defeat against Manchester City. Here’s what he had to say after the game.On how he thinks Liverpool will react: “It is a new experience for all of us. We can use that to our advantage and we’ll look forward to the games ahead now.” On that potentially season-defining 11.7mm: “I saw the picture of the one were Sadio hit the post and then the deflection - it was millimetres, but they’re the fine margins,” said Robertson. “If that goes in it might have been a completely different game. But they then scored before half-time and we needed to bounce back, which we did. I thought we were controlling the game at that point but we just left ourselves that wee bit too open and a team like City punish you. Credit goes to them but we are still four points clear at that is what we have got to remember.” There’s no word yet on whether or not how Rachel, Andy’s better half, is getting on but we wish them both all the very best.

He straight-batted all talk of Jermain Defoe’s expected move to Rangers.No deal has been finalised, so until that moment happens, it would be foolish of me to comment, so let’s wait and see what happens in the next few days. Any deal which does get agreed will be in the player’s best interest and what the player wants to pursue. “From our side, I have said from day one, I love working with Jermain.

We disappeared off the Football League radar for a while and when you have three years out of the league you can lose generations of fans. You can stop being a big football club. But we have seen in the last few years with trips to Wembley, occasions like this and the promotion battles that Tranmere is still here.

This story from last week, on Toby Alderweireld’s expected contract extension …… this is now an actual, official, tweeted-out-by-club thing …Daniel Taylor was on reporting duties last night …As the song goes, City fight to the end and it was not just their competitive courage to conjure up a decisive goal, courtesy of Leroy Sané, that delivered a message. It was the spirit of togetherness displayed by Guardiola’s players in that nerve-shredding finale when Liverpool started pumping balls into the penalty area.On one hand City have not kept a clean sheet during their past 11 fixtures. On the other it was a show of collective defiance during those fraught moments when Liverpool had Virgil van Dijk operating as an extra centre-forward. City gave everything to defend their lead, in the way that true champions do. They dug in, they formed an impenetrable blue line and, when it needed the ugly stuff, they were happy to oblige. In the process they made it clear to their opponents it is going to be one hell of a battle between now and the end of the season.”Jamie Jackson ran the rule over both sets of players. Lowest scorer: Dejan Lovren “Was near-awful throughout” (210). Sané (“scoring the finest goal of his City career) and Agüero (“Willing to dribble and take game to opponents”) both attracted 9s … And so, to last night’s freewheeling frenzy at the Etihad. An enthralling press-tastic game went City’s way after Leroy Sané slotted superbly 18 minutes from time. But should Vincent Kompany have been early in with the rubber ducks after going in two-footed to curtail Mo Salah’s charge towards Ederson’s goal?The images of victory will be rooted elsewhere. Vincent Kompany was at times a cartoon of chest-heaving full-body defence, although he might also have been sent off for an excessively forceful lunge through Mohamed Salah. At the end, as City’s players left the pitch, a teenage fan came haring through the lines to plead for a selfie with the captain and one half expected Kompany to take him out with a headlock- slamming two-footed Bruce Lee neck-lunge.Welcome to the first weekend countdown of 2019.

Her plight is common in a country racked by economic turmoilThe end of Maureen’s days at a primary school in north-eastern Zimbabwe marked the beginning of her life as a wife.At 13, the brightest student in her class in Mudzi, Mashonaland, she was married to a man three times her age.Her father, a poor farmer, had promised to fund Maureen’s secondary education but, when the time came, he could not raise the money. Marrying off his daughter was a quick fix. Maureen swiftly fell pregnant and was still 13 when she gave birth after spending hours in labour. The baby did not survive.Three years on and Maureen is at Chinhoyi provincial hospital. She is among the scores of underage brides being cared for here who are suffering from obstetric fistula, caused by prolonged labour.“I haven’t forgiven my parents for doing this to me. I had a bright future but now they treat me like an outcast,” says Maureen.“When my parents told me about the marriage I couldn’t believe it, because they had always given me the impression that I was their most intelligent child and I would pursue my studies. The man was abusive, he called me names and beat me several times, especially after I lost my baby,” she says. “My dreams were destroyed by that man.”Child marriage in Zimbabwe is often driven by poverty. Dowries offer a welcome, if brief, respite from penury in poor households struggling to weather a vicious economic crisis. The brides, though, are more likely to remain in a state of privation due to lack of personal development and education.Although underage marriage is illegal and local organisations have been fighting against it as an economic transaction, the financial meltdown has worsened the situation. About one in every three girls in Zimbabwe is married before the age of 18, the legal age of consent.According to campaign organisation Girls Not Brides, families see little worth in girls.“In many communities, economic opportunities are severely limited, especially for girls and women. Families therefore see little value in educating their daughters and instead marry them off to fulfil the role of a wife and mother,” says a Girls Not Brides spokesperson.Zimbabwe is facing an acute shortage of cash and, as basic commodities disappear from the shelves, families’ disposable income has been depleted.Kresi, 16, from Masvingo, is another teenager whose future was jeopardised when she was married off to a cattle farmer in her village. Her family received a dowry of two cows and a few groceries in exchange for Kresi. She also suffers from obstetric fistula, a hole between the genital tract and bladder or rectum caused by lengthy or obstructed labour.Women and girls who experience obstetric fistula suffer constant incontinence, shame, social segregation and further health problems. It is estimated that more than 2 million young women in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa live with the condition untreated.Tendai, 14, of Bindura says her family gave her away in exchange for 100 Zimbabwean dollars (22p).She was married to a man with three wives. As the youngest wife, Tendai is burdened with both child-bearing and work in the fields.“I still want to go back to school. I just hope my husband can give me that chance. But as the youngest wife I have to do everything here at home,” Tendai says.She is bitter over her parent’s decision to marry her off.With a drought looming and disposable incomes depleted from galloping inflation, poor families are more likely to exchange their daughter for very little.“In areas like Binga, Matabeleland, the dowry can be a goat, which is an insult to the value of the girl. In some instances families just leave their child at the man’s house to lessen their own burden,” says Grace Maunganidze, a local activist.Another activist, Abigail Mutema, blames child marriages on the stronghold of a patriarchal society.“Until women are emancipated, child marriages will never end. In some of the communities, girls as young as 16 are deemed too old, so they need to get married. There is nothing to do in the rural areas, so the easier route is to get married. Poverty plays a role in these child marriages,” says Mutema.“Older women have become perpetrators of these early child marriages. A woman is not complete without marriage, they say.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7455828cd8577066f175e9dea4dec132185274f/216_49_2613_1568/master/2613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff45430244ad5317ced3a97c004a1eab","title":"beyonce parkwood entertainment sued over website accessibility","story":"A lawsuit claims beyonce violates the Americans With Disabilities Act by failing to accommodate visually impaired usersA class action lawsuit claims that Beyoncé’s official website violates the Americans With Disabilities Act (1990) by denying visually impaired users equal access to its products and services, according to the Hollywood Reporter.Web accessibility requires photos to be coded with alt-text so that screen-readers used by visually impaired users can speak the alternative text.

Kelly’s legal representatives had threatened to sue the US channel Lifetime if it aired the series, claiming that the documentary is littered with false allegations and that its subjects are defaming Kelly for personal gain.The first two episodes of the six-part series were shown on Lifetime on 3 January, and focus on the beginning of Kelly’s career, prior to the emergence of a 2002 sex tape that would lead to his trial and acquittal.The first episode details Kelly’s relationship with the late R\u0026ampB singer Aaliyah, including allegations that Kelly, then 27, was seen having sex with the teenager on a tour bus, and that forged paperwork led to their illegal marriage when she was 15. Kelly’s former tour manager and personal assistant also alleges that Kelly impregnated the young singer, who died in a plane crash in 2001.Two women claimed that Kelly was sexually involved with girls as young as 14. Sparkle recalled Kelly grooming her niece when she was 12. The girl allegedly appeared in the sex tape that led to Kelly’s trial when she was 14. Singer Jovante Cunningham claimed that Kelly made teenage girls perform sexual acts in public, and had sex with a teenage girl in the studio with other people present. Lizzette Martinez, who claimed Kelly impregnated her while she was in high school, said that Kelly told her to “perform sexual acts while his friends were in the back seat”.Andrea Kelly claimed that her ex-husband involved her in an elaborate wedding ceremony without her prior knowledge. She described this as among the first times she realised he was “controlling”.In 2000, Chicago Sun Times reporter Jim DeRogatis was the first journalist to report on allegations that Kelly had sex with teenage girls. In 2002, Kelly was indicted on 21 counts of child pornography. He was cleared on 14 counts in 2007. It would take a decade – during which Kelly enjoyed chart success, cult acclaim for his spoof series Trapped in the Closet, and tastemaker support – for claims of Kelly’s sexual impropriety to find public traction. In July 2017, DeRogatis reported for BuzzFeed that Kelly was holding women in a “sex cult”, a story that led to more women accusing Kelly of sexual and physical abuse, and the decline of Kelly’s reputation.Kelly has broadly denied the allegations, and described as “too late” the #MuteRKelly campaign, which urges record labels, promoters and other parties with financial interests in Kelly to sever their ties with him. In July 2018, he released a 19-minute song, I Admit, in which he denied the allegations but “admitted” to sleeping with fans and having parents “push” their daughters on him “to get paid”. He also reiterated claims that he was sexually abused by a family member as a child.Lifetime will show the remaining four episodes of Surviving R Kelly on 4 and 5 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2964f028f083b586f1fa82377d89c6e43efea84/0_0_3034_1820/master/3034.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f8588064694c31f48ac52ce26cdeb49","title":"the greatest pop music dance crazes ranked","story":"It’s 40 years since we first spelled out YMCA to the Village People’s disco hit – here are 15 of the best finger-pointing, hip-wiggling hitsDespite his disdain for early 2000s choreography queens Britney and Christina, Fred Durst wasn’t immune to a dance craze. In this typically understated nu-metal video, he distinguishes his manly moves by throwing down on a helipad (very dangerous!) and inviting viewers to celebrate the size of his ... steering wheel.The classic novelty single was inspired by distant climes whose locals, one imagines, wouldn’t be seen dead dancing to it. Sure, it ruined your school disco, but consider the plight of singer Dene Michael Betteridge, who was forced to perform the song’s lumpen moves when in jail for benefit fraud. “These terrifying criminals tell you to do something, you do it,” he said.The only way to get smooth, mullet-sporting Cyrus on traditional country radio was to play up his horndog status. A choreographer taught the distinctive line dance to the female fans who turned up for the video shoot, the label organised a dance contest and the 90s line-dancing fad was born (before dying with Steps’ monstrous 5, 6, 7, 8).If my bandmates ruined my wedding, I wouldn’t be inclined to accompany them to a disco and knock out a rinky-dink dance routine, but such is life in the video for Tragedy. The hands-by-the-ears dance moves could be likened to Edvard Munch’s The Scream, if you had lost your mind and critical faculties.REM challenged themselves to write this dumb bubblegum song, which swiftly became their second US Top 10 hit. Needing a video to match, the director, Katherine Dieckmann, determined to break down Michael Stipe’s “staid” public image with this mildly aerobic, entirely charming routine that provoked much playground copycatting. A lark, but a self-aware and not-unkind one.US rap spurs global viral dances, but the UK scene isn’t too shabby at it. Following Skepta’s Rolex Sweep and KIG’s Head, Shoulders, Kneez \u0026amp Toez, Gun Lean finds Russ performing his glitchy, lean-back bob in Sainsbury’s cereal aisle and moving embattled drill closer to the (snap, crackle and) pop mainstream.The Saturday Night dance didn’t originate with Whigfield, but by the time she performed the No 1 hit on Top of the Pops, the kinetic, bunny-hopping bop had become such a phenomenon that the Dane had no choice but to scowl as some talentless buffoons performed it around her. Its legacy endures in regional aqua aerobics classes.Perhaps the only video to feature Princess Diana, Gaddafi and the Statue of Liberty, whose limbs were computer-manipulated into mimicking the ancient Egyptian reliefs that inspired the song. On one hand, this two-arm movement couldn’t be easier on the other, the video reveals dozens of uncoordinated New Yorkers making an enjoyable hash of it.Who knew that Psy’s pony-king dance could do so much harm? It has led to deaths, rival gang shootouts, near-fatal LSD trips, conspiracy theories, fraudster arrests, Ed Balls’ spirited jockeying and illegal firecracker production. Not to mention all the slipped discs.Most of the moves detailed in Crank That are easily replicable – punching, starting a motorbike, the robot – hence its breakout success. But one element of the song mercifully didn’t go mainstream: namely the “Superman”, which Urban Dictionary details as the emission of a certain fluid that then dries into a cape-like layer. Grisly.The first global dance craze is a softer, desexualised version of a dance that stems back to 19th-century slaves and looks incredibly gentle today. Still, it provoked endearing bafflement among commentators at the time, who likened its “piston-like motions” to “baffled bird keepers fighting off a flock of attacking blue jays”.The Macarena has fallen on hard times: macarena is canvassing for donations to stay up and running. But the methodical dance to one of the biggest one-hit wonders will live on, at least until the last 90s kid who can do it in their sleep passes away. Hey!The “faces” of the New York disco scene that inspired Saturday Night Fever were uniquely stylish men (at least, in Nik Cohn’s fabricated Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night feature). But the beauty of the diagonal point-and-bob, so immaculately done by John Travolta, is that any drunk slob can pull it off with aplomb.Of all the moves in Single Ladies – the Bob Fosse-inspired routine that spawned a thousand high-end exercise classes, the finger-waggy “huh oh oh”s aimed at giving nans an easy bit to follow – none is as arresting as Beyoncé’s final pose as she audibly gasps for breath after nailing it.Some of pop history’s finest moments turn on a flash of recontextualisation that sticks for ever: the interview that recast the Spice Girls as Scary, Ginger and co an outraged Mike Read pulling Relax off air, stoking its notoriety. You can watch one happen when the Village People performed YMCA on Dick Clark’s American Bandstand in January 1979. The group hadn’t choreographed a dance, but the audience, mistaking the band’s raised arms in the chorus for a Y formation, invented one on the spot. Clark, agog, made everyone do it again immediately.

We’re up for it.“The people in Peterborough want a Labour MP - they voted for a Labour MP the last time and I’m absolutely confident from what we have to offer that we would win a byelection in the very near future if one was to be held.”Onasanya, a 35-year-old solicitor, was convicted at a retrial of colluding with her brother Festus after her car was clocked going 41mph in a 30mph zone in the village of Thorney, near Peterborough, in July 2017.The court was told she was sent a notice of intended prosecution to fill out, but it was sent back naming the guilty driver as Aleks Antipow, an acquaintance of Festus who was away visiting his parents in Russia.Festus pleaded guilty to three counts of perverting the course of justice, including the 24 July incident. In a column in the Peterborough  over the Christmas period, Onasanya indicated she would continue as an MP.Making no mention of her conviction, she said constituents should “rest assured” that she would remain their representative fighting injustice in the corridors of power."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7923aee3ab97ec7337b3cb8837787922a4a6cb6/167_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa850f30aa1b09dae4105a5d50f7162e","title":"nearby galaxy large magellanic cloud set to collide with milky way","story":"Collision will ‘cause fireworks’ but probably won’t happen for about 2.5 billion years As if battered post-Christmas finances, a looming disorderly Brexit and the prospect of a fresh nuclear arms race were not enough to dampen spirits, astronomers have declared that a nearby galaxy will slam into the Milky Way and could knock our solar system far into the cosmic void.The unfortunate discovery was made after scientists ran computer simulations on the movement of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), one of the many satellite galaxies that orbits the Milky Way. Rather than circling at a safe distance, or breaking free of the Milky Way’s gravitational pull, the researchers found the LMC is destined to clatter into the galaxy we call home.At the moment, the LMC is estimated to be about 163,000 light years from the Milky Way and speeding away at 250 miles per second. But simulations by astrophysicists at Durham University show that the LMC will eventually slow down and turn back towards us, ultimately smashing into the Milky Way in about 2.5 billion years’ time.While inidual stars and planets are unlikely to collide, the arrival of a galaxy weighing as much as 250 billion suns will still wreak havoc. “The whole of the Milky Way will be shaken and the entire solar system could be ejected into outer space,” said Carlos Frenk, director of the Institute for Computational Cosmology at Durham. “If that happens, I don’t see how our descendants, if we have any, will be able to withstand it.”In one sense, the collision with the LMC is long overdue. The Milky Way is an oddball among spiral galaxies. The halo of stars that surrounds its galactic disc contains far fewer stars than comparable galaxies. But that is not all. The supermassive black hole at the Milky Way’s centre is paltry, only one-tenth as massive as those found at the hearts of similar galaxies.The galactic merger will change all of this. “Once the LMC gets gobbled up by the Milky Way, our galaxy will become a beautiful, normal spiral,” said Frenk. “Most of the halo will become stars from the LMC and the black hole will gorge on this sudden unexpected abundance of fuel and it will go berserk.”The LMC holds vast amounts of gas that will be devoured by the supermassive black hole until it reaches up to 10 times its present mass. As it feeds, the black hole will become “active” and send out powerful jets of high-energy radiation. While intense beams of gamma radiation may potentially spark mass extinctions, the radiation driven by the black hole is unlikely to pose a threat to any life that may exist on Earth, the authors write.In the past, astronomers who concerned themselves with the demise of the Milky Way focused their attention on the upcoming collision with the Andromeda galaxy. At five times the mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud, Andromeda could completely destroy the Milky Way when the two collide. That cosmic catastrophe is expected in about four billion years’ time.But the merger with the LMC could postpone the cataclysm, said Frenk. “One of the by-products of the collision with the LMC is it will delay armageddon,” he said. “It will move the Milky Way a bit and that may buy us a couple of billion years.“The LMC is big but it won’t completely destroy our galaxy,” he said. “It’ll produce these amazing fireworks, but it doesn’t have the mass to create a huge disturbance. The collision with Andromeda really will be armageddon. That really will be the end of the Milky Way as we know it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f99a64eae077787e68323768518495aa5f100a50/0_113_4124_2474/master/4124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c58802cd65d24a4b96fee014949f7d3e","title":"benefit cap single mothers make up 85percent of those affected data shows","story":"DWP records show 134,044 households had support capped, with single mothers accounting for 114,337The vast majority of people being penalised by the government’s benefit cap are single mothers, new analysis has found.Records show that 134,044 households have had support capped by the government, with single mothers accounting for 114,337 of those. They appear to show a significant jump from August last year, when nearly 50,000 single parents were reportedly facing a drop in benefits due to the cap.The benefit cap, which limits the total amount households can receive in benefits to £20,000 a year, or £23,000 in Greater London, was envisaged as an “incentive” to persuade unemployed people to move into work.Critics claim it is forcing many people into poverty and resulted in social cleansing because rents in inner-city areas are so high.Labour claims the statistics show ministers are failing to assess the impact of their policies upon vulnerable children.The shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood, said single mothers were being pushed into poverty by the cap.“The Conservatives have pushed ahead with their austerity agenda with scant regard for the impact on low-income families,” she said. “Labour will build a social security system that is there for any of us in our time of need.”The latest figures were released on the DWP’s Stat-Xplore site in November and include statistics showing the number of men and women whose benefits were capped up to August of last year.The latest figures also show that 120,297 single claimant women had their benefits capped, compared with just 13,743 single claimant men over the same period. The vast majority of those women had dependent children.The latest disclosure follows other recent studies which found that the cap was leaving more people in debt and pushing poor children further into poverty.A study of more than 10,000 benefit-capped households by the Policy in Practice consultancy found that for every child whose parents moved back into work as a result of the cap, eight more would grow up in families whose financial circumstances  worsened following the introduction of the policy.More than half of the households affected by the benefit cap were left stuck on it for six months or more. The average gap between rent and housing benefit for families stuck on the cap was £3,750 a year.Pioneered by the former chancellor George Osborne, the cap limited total benefits to £26,000 per year at its introduction in 2013. It was then cut in November 2016 to the present levels, quadrupling the number of families affected.The DWP did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d042096a32e60010d7433f1786aec6ecdf237ac4/160_0_5625_3376/master/5625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acdf029042196c41ef61504bcb9187ac","title":"vaping by young people remains burning issue health experts","story":"Despite much debate in UK and US there is still little agreement over how safe e-cigarettes areSifting through contradictory evidence is common when it comes to choosing the right thing to do to improve our health, not least at new year when many of us promise to leave old habits behind and make a fresh start. One topic that is almost guaranteed to provoke arguments is e-cigarettes. Thousands of research papers have been published about these devices over the past decade. But we do not seem to be much closer to a global consensus on their risks or benefits, and arguably the debate is becoming more entrenched. What is going on?A number of factors appear to be fuelling this, but in 2018 one more than any other seemed to be driving the debate. It relates to the consequences of e-cigarette use by young people, and the extent that youth vaping will lead to smoking. In other words: are e-cigarettes creating a new generation of nicotine users, and will these vapers become the smokers of the future?Scientists and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic pondered the evidence on these questions in 2018 and came to different conclusions. In the US, the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine reported that “there is substantial evidence that e-cigarette use increases risk of ever using combustible tobacco cigarettes among youth and young adults”. Advice from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention says: “E-cigarettes are not safe for youth, young adults, pregnant women or adults who do not currently use tobacco products.”In the UK, an updated evidence review from Public Health England concluded: “E-cigarettes are attracting very few young people who have never smoked into regular use, and e-cigarettes do not appear to be undermining the long-term decline in cigarette smoking in the UK among young people.” In addition, a House of Commons science and technology committee report stated: “Concerns about the risk of e-cigarettes potentially providing a ‘gateway’ into conventional smoking have not materialised to any significant degree.”Differing policies may also help explain these differences. In the UK, almost all forms of e-cigarette marketing have been banned since 2016. This is not the case in the US. In addition, newer devices appear to be popular with young Americans. These include Juul, which are small, discreet, easy to use and deliver nicotine more rapidly than older models, and have only recently become available in the UK. The EU also imposes limits on the amount of nicotine in e-cigarettes, controls not in place in the US.Attitudes to nicotine also differ. The UK has official guidance on tobacco harm reduction that recognises nicotine is not the harmful substance in tobacco (it is the thousands of other chemicals in cigarettes) and nicotine replacement therapy is licensed for use in smokers who are pregnant or children above the age of 12. In the US, the statement that nicotine harms the developing brain (evidence that comes from studies with mice and rats, not humans) is widely used in official documents. This means any e-cigarette use by American youth, even experimentation, is viewed as a cause for concern.Evidence from the US and UK combined indicates that efforts to deter teenagers from trying vaping may discourage adult smokers from using e-cigarettes to quit smoking. Fortunately, in both countries smoking rates continue to decline for both adults and young people, a fact often forgotten amid the furore about e-cigarettes. If e-cigarettes were a gateway to tobacco, these trends would stall or be reversed. And in the UK at least, government agencies and leading charities actively support vaping as a positive choice for smokers trying to stop.We should not be forced to choose between protecting children and supporting the one in two adult smokers who will suffer and die prematurely from a smoking-related disease if they continue to smoke. The challenge in 2019 and beyond will be to ensure the right balance is struck.Prof Linda Bauld is professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, deputy director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, and holds the Cancer Research UK (CRUK)Bupa chair in behavioural research for cancer prevention at CRUK.Dr Suzi Gage is a lecturer at the University of Liverpool.

Of the eight coaches who left their position this season, five were minorities: Steve Wilks, Marvin Lewis, Vance Joseph, Hue Jackson and Todd Bowles. One, Wilks, was fired after only one year on the job.While some of those five may well be replaced by other minority coaches, the firings put the league in a difficult position. Roger Goodell, to his credit, has made the advancement of minority coaches one of the crucial issues during his run as NFL commissioner. The Rooney Rule, which requires all teams to interview a minority candidate for its openings at head coach and general manager, has been tweaked and improved. Several teams have adopted internship programs for ex-players looking to start a coaching career, and the league itself has plowed more resources into the development of minority coaches.Decision-makers are more likely to hire those who look like them, sound like them, run in the same social circles, or have the same social experiences. The NFL currently has two minority owners. When a person of color walks into a job interview in the NFL, there is a very good chance that they will see a bunch of white faces who have lived different social experiences.So much of this industry revolves around close, personal relationships. Twenty-two of the league’s 32 teams have been owned by the same person or family for at least 20 years. They all have coaches and executives they are particularly connected to. Oakland aiders owner Mark Davis didn’t hire Jon Gruden because he was the best person for the job. He did so because he liked him. And Gruden didn’t oust McKenzie and hire Mike Mayock as his GM because Mayock has a more illustrious track record as a team builder. He did it because he and Mayock share the same sensibilities.The NFL tweaked its rules last year in a bid to prevent the kind of Gruden-Davis backroom deal. Owners are now required to sit in on all head coaching interviews. And gone are the days of the sham, in-house interviews with a person of color, meant only to satisfy the logistics of the Rooney Rule and not the spirit. Goodell and the league office, in a rare moment of leadership, understood the difficult position they were putting such minority coaches in.“You are really stuck between a rock and a hard place,” a former African American NFL head coach told CBS Sports in 2016. “You have the pressure from the Fritz Pollard Alliance to take any interview you are offered ‘for the good of the cause,’ even if you felt like you are just being used. So you don’t want to let them down.”The league changed the language of the rule. Now owners and decision-makers are required to interview an out-of-house candidate or someone from the league’s pre-approved list: the NFL’s Career Developmental List. It is a far from perfect solution. But it is a start.One additional issue is the profile of head coaches teams are hiring. More and more they are hiring offensive assistants and quarterback coaches: 15 of the last 20 head coaching hires have had an offensive background. And coaches specializing in offense are overwhelmingly white. In 2018, there were 14 minority coordinators in the NFL, and only two were offensive coordinators.As such, this becomes a fairly simple equation: owners want flashy, exciting hires. An explosive offense is considered more exciting than a feisty defense. There are more white offensive coaches than minority ones. There are more white executives than minorities. People hire candidates with similar backgrounds. Therefore, more white coaches are hired than minority ones, regardless of the make-up of the league generally.All minority candidates have asked for is a fair chance to compete for the top jobs in their sport. To get there, the NFL needs to rethink its model. The Rooney Rule has helped progress, but it remains a flawed rule. Improving ersity at the executive level, and getting more minority coaches into offensive coaching positions is the only way forward."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab7697e4d48e397abc0fcef30b1c8c5ef22e048e/0_313_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f717a1f2769f009dd1e7170a4414dd71","title":"talking horses rooneys cheltenham boycott meagre evidence horse racing tips","story":"Owners have an absolute right to pick and choose where and when their horses run but the Rooneys’ decision is based on very limited dataFour days after it emerged that Paul and Clare Rooney, who have one of the largest strings of jumping horses in the UK, have instructed their trainers to boycott Cheltenham until further notice, both the track and the wider racing public are still waiting for further details about the “safety concerns” that apparently prompted the owners’ decision.All that is clear thus far is that the Rooneys feel that their runners face an increased risk of injury when racing at Cheltenham, and believe that they have statistical evidence to back them up. Paul Rooney seemed to suggest earlier this week that their data will be published in due course, but as yet, the actual numbers have yet to see the light of day.Cheltenham, meanwhile, keeps its own detailed records on injuries to runners but these are logged by trainer and jockey rather than the horse’s owner and for now at least, the track will wait to hear what, if anything, the Rooneys want to add before digging out any data of its own.A trawl through the form book from the start of the 2014-15 season, though, shows that in that time, the Rooneys have had 44 runners at Cheltenham, two of which – Starchitect and Melrose Boy – suffered a fatal injury. Five more of their runners at the course since May 2014 have not raced subsequently, but that does not necessarily mean that the horses concerned suffered a career-ending injury at the course.Yet there is, of course, no in-between when it comes to a fatal injury, and it should also be borne in mind that neither Starchitect nor Melrose Boy died as the result of a fall.Starchitect was leading a race between the final two fences when he broke down, which is the sort of incident that, while extremely rare, could happen anywhere. Melrose Boy, meanwhile, was struck into during the Martin Pipe Conditionals’ Handicap Hurdle and put down a few days later. Handicaps at the Festival generally attract maximum fields – there were 23 in Melrose Boy’s race – which must slightly increase the chance that one horse will kick another mid-race, but this is a potential reason for avoiding Festival handicaps rather than a complete, indefinite boycott of the track.Ultimately, a sample of just 44 horses – or even 244, for that matter – seems far too small a sample from which to draw a firm conclusion on whether there is a significantly higher risk of injury to runners at Cheltenham, or that the Rooneys have just been very, very unfortunate over the last few seasons.A little more certainty should be possible at some stage in the future, as the launch of “a major research project to develop a predictive model for identifying risk factors for all jump racing” was among the 17 recommendations in the British Horseracing Authority’s recent review of last year’s Festival.For now, it remains possible – indeed, quite likely – that the risk of fatal injury for runners at Cheltenham in general, and at the Festival above all, is slightly higher than it is at many other tracks. The Festival is the most important meeting of the season by far and everything is travelling a little bit quicker and trying a little bit harder from the off.However, any increased risk – if it exists at all – can only be marginal when set against the much more significant increase that arises from asking horses to jump at least eight obstacles in the first place, as opposed to racing on the Flat. And perhaps, in the end, this is the Rooneys’ direction of travel, as their dark blue and yellow colours have been seen more frequently on the level in recent seasons, most notably aboard My Dream Boat, the winner of the Group One Prince of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot in 2016.Paul and Clare Rooney have sunk millions into racing under both codes in recent seasons and had runners from nearly 20 different jumping stables last season. They have an absolute right to pick and choose where and when their horses run and have suffered, by any measure, some terrible luck at Cheltenham recently.Few would blame them for deciding to boycott the track for no other reason than painful memories and superstition. The apparent link to safety concerns, though, is an implied criticism of Cheltenham’s welfare standards and professionalism, and appears to be based on very meagre evidence.  There is a sense that the January weather is slowly closing in ahead of a possible spell of very cold weather next week, but Lingfield’s jumps card survived an 8am inspection on Friday morning and there is a full programme of four meetings as a result.Hint Of Grey (1.30) and Bonza Girl (3.05) should both go well at the Surrey course while Abbreviate (1.45) has an obvious chance on the jumps card at Wetherby.The two most valuable meetings are on the all-weather, however, with Family Fortunes (3.50) making plenty of appeal at around 7-2 at Kempton Park. Michael Madgwick’s gelding remains in good form having won over course and distance in November, while Freedom And Wheat (6.45), a winner on his final start at twoÂ last time out, should start his three-year-old career in similar vein."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36bd1276a7a0cca37ba460210506302fc4ddab0a/334_351_4911_2947/master/4911.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a085c579a765d702c19dec0ae26a6659","title":"swan lake review english national ballet london coliseum","story":"Coliseum, LondonEnglish National Ballet’s revival of Derek Deane’s 1997 staging has a flock of well-schooled swans and some standout solos, but there is a lack of chemistry between the leading coupleA three-hour ballet is made up of thousands of tiny moments. The smallest thing – the lift of an eyeline, the uncurling of a finger – can be the making of magic, and across those hours there will be fantastic moments and uninspiring ones. And yet sometimes what it all adds up to is, y’know, perfectly OK.Not that there isn’t plenty to admire in Derek Deane’s Swan Lake. It was originally made in 1997 for English National Ballet to perform in the round at the Royal Albert Hall, with an army of swans filling the arena, but this is the slimmed-down version for proscenium theatre. It is easier to tour, even if it is not as exciting and occasionally you can see that there are too many bodies and steps for the size of the stage. But its busyness is also a plus. Swan Lake may be a classic but it is not without its weaknesses. Dramatically speaking, act one is mostly filler, all courtly shenanigans for the corps de ballet, so Deane packs in a billion steps to keep the energy driving forward, with quick footwork and intricate patterning giving texture to the choreography as conductor Gavin Sutherland bounces the orchestra along.The company as a whole are very good. James Streeter brings the drama as sorcerer Rothbart. In the ensemble, Precious Adams shows poise and a lovely weight to her port de bras. There is a flock of well-schooled swans, and there are standout solos in the act one Pas de Trois, especially from Daniel McCormick, winner of ENB’s Emerging Dancer competition last year, whose long legs launch him skyward, every jump and turn perfectly finished. Then there is bright and sparky Julia Conway, hopping on her pointes with light touch and fluttering beats, a young dancer to keep an eye on.At the centre of this energetic court, however, Isaac Hernández plays Prince Siegfried as a young man whose whole self has been subdued by the pressure of princely expectations. There may be lots going on in Siegfried’s head but it’s not finding its way out in any physical or facial expression – apart from Hernández generally looking a bit uncertain. And yet there are surprises. Hernández’s energy is so low-key that you almost don’t notice him throw out a casual double tours here and there. And he comes to life in act three with silently soaring grand jetés and some elegant turns. Hernández is a gifted dancer, but there is still room for him to develop as an artist and performer.Jurgita Dronina, a principal ENB shares with National Ballet of Canada, is a more confident presence in the central OdetteOdile role, and a solid technician too. She gets better as the evening progresses. Her flustered Odette retains a human element, while as black swan Odile – her execution impeccably clean, not an ounce of energy wasted – there is something unreal about her. As she dances with the besotted Siegfried, her eyes are smilingly fixed on Rothbart, making her seem less like a co-conspirator (as she’s usually played) and more like another bewitched puppet in his evil plan. Sadly, there is little chemistry between the leading couple, in either guise, so for all its many merits and standout moments, this Swan Lake ends up feeling somewhat hollow at the core."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a4dbf4bd161859bf52e278360b1997a502eeacd/43_153_1186_711/master/1186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8964eb79e17d038fe9618f4e798e0fee","title":"kele okereke on masculinity and the music industry","story":"When Bloc Party released their debut album in 2005, Kele Okereke made people look at the music world differently. As a gay man of colour he didn’t fit the everyday indie rock frontman mould – he shattered it. As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we look at his extraordinary influence. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Laura McCluskeyNobody could accuse Kele Okereke of standing still. Following the release of his acclaimed 2017 solo effort, Fatherland, he’s spent the second half of this year on a sold-out international tour with his band Bloc Party, who are revisiting their beginnings by performing their seminal debut album, Silent Alarm, in its entirety. Meanwhile, he’s somehow found time to co-compose the score for the highly anticipated new musical Leave to Remain, which opens at the Lyric Hammersmith in January, with songwriter Matt Jones.And while his professional life continues to metamorphosise, his personal life has also taken on a new dimension as he, along with his partner, welcomed a baby girl into their lives. They called her Savannah. When I interviewed Okereke for Attitude magazine last year, I reminded him that he’d once proclaimed that his solo album came about because all his bandmates wanted to stop and have babies, but he wanted to wait until he was 35.“Did I say that? Wow!” he said. “I’ve always wanted to be a father, but as a gay man I didn’t know if it was possible.”While being a gay parent in the UK these days isn’t exactly a revolutionary act, back in the mid-noughties a queer black singer fronting an indie rock band was nothing short of extraordinary. This was a scene dominated by straight white men where a certain type of swaggering masculinity was the default, yet here was a softly spoken, soulful gay man whose band was leading the race.Even though Okereke himself didn’t formally come out until his solo career took off, during Bloc Party’s reign his queerness was hiding in plain sight. He was never a flamboyant performer in the Freddie Mercury mould, and he didn’t openly embrace his sexuality the way a new generation of queer singers including Olly Alexander, Troye Sivan and Hayley Kiyoko would come to do. But his tender masculinity and softly coded lyrics spoke volumes.As a young, gay, indie music fan myself, who was many years away from landing the job of deputy editor of Attitude, I can attest to the importance of seeing someone like Okereke up on stage back then. And even though he might have been deliberately singing ambiguously, when Okereke launched into I Still Remember, from sophomore album A Weekend In The City, the queer intent was clear. The song is about two teenage lovers, both too afraid to make a move (“You should have asked me for itI would have been brave”). Here was someone who saw the world differently, here was someone like me.Fast forward 11 years and there’s nothing coded about Okereke now, or the songs he sings. On Fatherland he duets with Years \u0026amp Years’s Olly Alexander, on a track called Grounds for Resentment. “It’s the first time I’ve ever sung a romantic duet with another boy, and that’s important,” he says. “I feel, as a gay singer, you can fall into the trap of thinking we’re not really allowed to express desire. That as a gay man singing about love and desire, everything has to be coded.”That trap has opened wide now and Okereke can proudly count himself among a legion of queer musicians whose sexuality is everyday, yet still extraordinary.Okereke’s boundless musical curiosity has since seen him move into theatre as he scores a highly anticipated new play, out early 2019. Leave to Remain tells the story of a gay couple whose marriage forces two very different families to come together.While it’s clear that Okereke’s not short of projects to give his attention to, his primary focus for the foreseeable future is his own family. When I asked him if he has any doubts about raising his daughter as a gay parent he’s firm in his response: “We’re going to do all that we can to make sure she has the strength to stand in her own convictions,” he says. “That’s how I’ve lived my life. I’ve had to go out and be myself in spite of what everyone was telling me.”Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps. We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

In total, she suffered 15 Democratic defections, mostly from new members who pledged to oppose her during their campaigns and from old foes who have long called for new leadership.When the tally was announced, Democrats erupted in applause. Several members embraced Pelosi as her grandchildren, who were seated on the chamber floor, bounced up and down with excitement. In reclaiming the gavel, Pelosi, who had previously served as speaker from 2007-2011, became the first former speaker to win re-election since Sam Rayburn in 1955.She then swore into office the 116th Congress, which includes a record 102 women. The incoming freshman class is the youngest and most racially erse in history, with a number of outspoken members prepared to take on Donald Trump.“Our nation is at a historic moment,” Pelosi said in her remarks on the House floor. “Two months ago, the American people spoke and demanded a new dawn.”In their first act after officially taking control of the House of Representatives on Thursday, Democrats tested their power in a newly ided Washington by passing legislation to end a partial government shutdown about to enter its 14th day.The two-part package, passed just before 10pm, includes a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels until 8 February, providing $1.3bn for border security measures but ignoring Trump’s demand for $5.6bn to build 200 miles of fencing along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico.The second part funds the other federal agencies that are now unfunded, including the agriculture, interior, transportation, commerce and justice departments, until 30 September, the end of the current fiscal year.Though the legislation is unlikely to break the impasse over the shutdown – Trump formally pledged to veto it in an official White House statement on Thursday – it sets the tone for what is expected to be a tumultuous final two years of the president’s first term.Earlier in the day special guests had gathered to watch Pelosi elected, including the singer Tony Bennett, Mickey Hart, drummer of the Grateful Dead and fashion consultant Tim Gunn. Pelosi’s supporters wore pins that said “Madame Speaker”.To secure her ascent, Pelosi defused an attempt to block her nomination with a series of concessions to opponents, including pledging to support term limits for serving as speaker. In doing so, she won over key dissenters such as Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged her in 2016.The opposition to Pelosi manifested itself in different ways. Three Democrats voted present (including the newly elected Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who first attempted to vote “no”, which was not an option).Others backed a variety of candidates. There were three votes for the incoming Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) chair, Cheri Bustos of Illinois, two for Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and other votes cast for politicians such as the former vice-president Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams, the losing Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Georgia.But for the most part, she received enthusiastic endorsements from the Democrats. Several congresswomen dedicated their vote for Pelosi to the young women who will come after them. Congresswoman Lucy McBath said she would vote for Pelosi in honor of her son Jordan, who was fatally shot in Florida. A new member from Texas, Veronica Escobar, enthusiastically voted for “Nancy ‘No Wall’ Pelosi” while others cheered for “NDP” – the initials for Nancy D’Alesandro Pelosi.One Democratic aide hailed Pelosi as a “mastermind” for her comfortable win and said: “All of us are amazed by how easy today’s vote will be for her.”The aide noted, however, that unlike Pelosi’s first stint as speaker, “managing this caucus will be more difficult than back in 2007”.The 2019-20 Congress began work on Thursday with roughly a quarter of the federal government closed, affecting 800,000 employees, in a shutdown triggered by Trump’s demand last month for the money for a wall along the US-Mexican border – opposed by Democrats – as part of any legislation to fund government agencies.Trump started Thursday by blaming Democrats for the impasse, calling their opposition to a wall “strictly politics”.He wrote on Twitter: “The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election. The Democrats know they can’t win based on all of the achievements of ‘Trump,’ so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security – and Presidential Harassment. For them, strictly politics!”Trump had previously said he would be “proud” to shut down the government to secure funding to build a physical barrier along America’s southern border.During a contentious meeting with top congressional leaders in the White House Situation Room on Wednesday, Trump said the shutdown could last “a long time” and promised to reject any offer that did not include billions in taxpayer dollars for a wall, despite the fact that he has repeatedly stated Mexico would be forced to pay for it.At a press conference on Thursday, Pelosi implored Trump to take “yes for an answer”, noting that the bills had previously drawn overwhelming support from Senate Republicans. However, she insisted “we’re not doing a wall” and described Trump’s signature proposal as “an immorality”.The House bills will now go to the Senate, which remains under Republican control. They need 60 votes to advance. Last month, the Senate easily passed legislation that would have funded the government through 8 February without money for Trump’s border wall. However the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has pledged not to put the legislation on the floor, describing it as “political theatre, not productive policymaking”.

The Chang’e lunar mission is named after the Chinese moon goddess.China’s state news agency, Xinhua, said the probe took a small plant called arabidopsis which is expected to produce the first flower on the moon. Other items included in a mini-biosphere include cotton, rapeseed, potato, fruit fly and yeast.Thursday’s successful touchdown in the unexplored South Pole-Aitken basin, the biggest known impact structure in the solar system, was hailed a major technical feat and is seen as a important step towards China’s wider ambitions in space. Spacecraft have taken pictures of the moon’s far side before, but no lander has ever landed there.The moon’s far side is sometimes known as the dark side, although it is not darker than the near side in any literal sense. It undergoes the same phases of illumination by the Sun as the side facing Earth. But because the moon spins on its axis at exactly the same rate as it orbits Earth, one side remains permanently out of view.It was only in 1959, when the first images of the far side were beamed back by the Soviet Union’s Luna 3, that intriguing differences were revealed. The far side is pockmarked by more craters and appears almost devoid of the seas of solidified lava, known as maria, that form the shadowy shape of a face that we see from Earth.The mission will also conduct the first astronomy observations from the moon’s far side, which is seen as a uniquely attractive site for monitoring radio waves coming from deep space. Astronomers operating Earth-bound radio telescopes have to constantly grapple with electromagnetic interference from human activity: shortwave broadcasting, maritime communication, telephone and television signals. The far side of the moon is shielded from such signals, making it far easier to pick up faint fingerprints left by the Big Bang.The craft is also carrying a mini-greenhouse, which will test how well plants, specifically potatoes and small flowering Arabidopsis plants, related to cabbage, grow on the moon.Associated Press contributed to this article"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/301241d3db4b4150d839e1f24d5525146c97c810/0_82_4028_2417/master/4028.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b593948cd0167dff816287bbac47269","title":"uk nationals in italy assured of residency in event of no brexit deal","story":"British in Italy group say their worst fears are over after landing new year Brexit breakBritish nationals settled in Italy have landed a new year Brexit break after the Italian government announced they would remain legal residents of the country in the event of no deal.High level officials from the Ministero degli Affari Esteri told volunteers in the British in Italy campaign group that they “would continue to be legally resident with their existing rights to work” if Theresa May does not get her withdrawal agreement ratified and the UK crashes out of the EU on 29 March.“Our worst fears are over. This makes Italy the first EU27 country to publicly declare their plans for citizens’ rights post-Brexit, and to provide the reassurance we have been awaiting so long,” said the group in a statement.The Italian breakthrough comes days after immigration officials in Berlin vowed to open an urgent registration process to secure legal status will be in place for them in the event of the UK leaving the EU with no deal.The Berlin authorities delivered their promise quickly opening the registration process on Thursday 3 January, and telling worried Britons that if there was no deal they would be briefly exempt from German law requiring residency documentation.“From 30.03.2019 onwards British citizens in Germany will, for an initial period of three months until 30.06.2019, be exempted from the requirement to possess a German residency title,” they said on their website.Before Christmas the French also sought to reassure British nationals in France of their status post-Brexit. Nathalie Loiseau, the Europe minister, said that France would guarantee the residence, employment and welfare rights of the 160,000 resident British citizens living there provided that Britain offered the same guarantees to French expatriates.There are an estimated 60,000 British nationals living and working in Italy who were concerned at the prospect of becoming “irregular” with no rights to reside, work, or access national healthcare or social security if there was no deal.While British in Italy says they feel reassured that they will not now be illegal, they are concerned that they lose some of their rights including the freedom to move to another EU country or work or offer services in another EU country.This is because negotiations on these rights were set aside, to be discussed at the next Brexit phase of talks on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.“I feel a mixture of extreme relief that whatever happens with Brexit we will be able to continue to live legally in our adopted home, but this is coupled with a great anger that I and so many others have been left in this situation for so long when it could have been settled on 27 June 2016,” said Denise Abel, member of British in Italy.But she added: “I thank the Italian government from the bottom of my heart for doing what was promised to us, making it possible for us to continue to live our lives as before. The situation is not perfect for those of us who rely on freedom of movement for our work but at least we Brits in Italy can sleep better in our beds knowing we will not become illegal in our own homes.”A fellow member of the campaign group, Carole-Anne Richards, said she had “mixed feelings” about the news but her immediate feeling was “one of relief” that she won’t be illegal.“At the end of the day the UK government has not ensured my rights will be the same as promised – they will be significantly diminished,” she said.The absence of freedom of movement affects Britons who work in multiple EU countries and has lead to accusations that the EU and May are leaving them “landlocked”.According to one of the representative of British in Italy, the Italian state representatives assured them “they are working on legislation that will be in place by 29 March, so in the event of no deal we will all be legally resident and entitled work and continue with our existing rights now, as they are now”.They said they are hoping to replicate the rights Britons have had under Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement if that is ratified.This will mean British nationals can continue to live and work in the country, but they will still be without some of their rights including the freedom of movement to live or work in another EU country, or the ability to offer services in another country.British in Europe, the coalition of campaign groups for Britons facing the loss of rights because of Brexit, have accused the UK of abandoning an estimated 1 million Britons who would be left high and dry if the UK crashes out of the block.The UK did not respond to this offer and instead came up with its own version of immigration rules for EU citizens in the UK forcing the EU to negotiate on these terms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af24f4769acc653c32759678792c85556c63c879/465_930_2341_1404/master/2341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a445ee97211918934720545db3592659","title":"seaching for scrap in guatemala city in pictures","story":"Workers known as guajeros descend daily to search for recyclable items at one of the biggest rubbish dumps in Guatemala City.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe It would be “helpful” if European Union leaders knew what clarifications they could offer on the Brexit withdrawal agreement that would assist UK prime minister Theresa May pass the deal through the House of Commons, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Speaking after a phone call with German chancellor Angela Merkel, the Taoiseach said they both agreed to stand by the Brexit withdrawal agreement and discussed how to help Mrs May pass the deal in the House of Commons.Separately, almost 1,000 police officers from England and Scotland are to begin training for deployment in Northern Ireland in case of disorder from a no-deal Brexit, according to a report in .The plans were put in place after Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) chiefs asked for reinforcements to deal with any trouble that arises from a hard border. The training for officers from English forces and Police Scotland is expected to begin this month.The prospect of large numbers of English and Scottish officers being deployed on the streets of Northern Ireland after March 29th could complicate efforts to restore the power-sharing executive at Stormont, which collapsed in 2017.The option of reinforcements is deemed necessary to cover the possibility of civil disorder arising from disquiet about Border arrangements that could be put in place after a hard Brexit.The PSNI request was made under mutual aid arrangements, which are in place to enable local police forces to help each other in times of heightened demands.On Thursday, Mr Varadkar said while the EU could offer assurances and clarifications to the UK, nothing could “contradict or change” the withdrawal agreement struck in November, including the backstop.The backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard border in Ireland even if there is no future EU-UK trade deal next March, is the main impediment to Mrs May getting the deal passed in Westminster. MPs are due to vote on the deal in the middle of the month.There have been calls from the United Kingdom for clarifications that the backstop will be temporary, and Mr Varadkar has said it was always only meant to hold “unless and until” a future trade deal that avoids a hard border is in place.“What would be helpful for us as EU prime ministers and presidents would be to know what clarifications would be enough to secure a majority in the House of Commons but always understanding that clarifications, understandings, guarantees, explanations cannot go against the spirit or render inoperable parts of the withdrawal agreement,” he said.“We need to know what the United Kingdom parliament wants in terms of those guarantees and those clarifications. This is something we will have to see develop over the next week or two.”Mr Varadkar said he and Ms Merkel spoke for about 40 minutes at the chancellor’s request. They also spoke about planning for a no-deal scenario, which was also discussed by the Cabinet in Dublin on Thursday.At the Cabinet meeting on January 15th, Minister for Health Simon Harris and Minister for Transport Shane Ross will give detailed outlines of planning for the supply of medicines and in the transport sector if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal in March. Other ministers will follow at subsequent meetings.The Taoiseach said that the 45 pieces of legislation needed for a no-deal Brexit outcome will be condensed into four large Bills. If needed, time would be cleared in the Dáil and Seanad in March for such legislation rather than have both Houses “tied up” in January and February, the Taoiseach said.On the issue of State aid in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Taoiseach said the Government would largely be asking the EU for “State aid clearance”.“Us being allowed to use our own money to support companies, businesses and farmers who are adversely affected by Brexit,” he said.Mr Varadkar will travel to Bavaria on Friday to address the annual gathering of the Christian Social Union, the regional sister party of Ms Merkel’s national Christian Democratic Union."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3747008.1546533512!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nostalgia for deutschmark fades as germans accept euro","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA customer pays for a hot dog in Frankfurt at the start of  2002.

Photograph: EPAUK prime minister’s officeMore than half of grassroots Conservative members want British prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal to be ditched in favour of no deal, a survey has found.About 57 per cent of the rank-and-file are convinced that leaving the EU without a deal is better than their own leader’s Brexit plan, according to a poll funded by the UK’s Economic and Social Research Council.Less than a quarter (23 per cent) would vote for Mrs May’s deal in a three-way referendum between the deal, no deal and remaining in the EU.The latest findings are bad news for Mrs May’s hopes of winning support for her deal, said research leader Prof Tim Bale. “If Theresa May is hoping that her MPs will return to Westminster having been persuaded by their constituency associations to back her Brexit deal, she’s going to be disappointed,” he said.“It appears that those members are in no mood for compromise. Moreover, the Tory rank-and-file, it seems, are convinced that no deal is better than May’s deal.”Prof Bale added: “Tory members’ dislike for the PM’s deal really comes out when we asked about a referendum in which the choice came down to her deal or no deal. Only 29 per cent of Tory members would vote for Mrs May’s deal, compared to 64 per cent who would vote to leave without a deal.“But that’s as nothing to Conservative Party members faced with a referendum offering just two choices – remain or no deal. Some 76 per cent of Conservative Party members would plump for no deal.”He said there were two specific issues behind the opposition to Mrs May’s deal, the first being the Irish backstop.“Tory members have become convinced that the Irish backstop is a bad idea,” he said. The survey, he pointed out, found that that 40 per cent of Conservative Party members thought the backstop was a reason in itself to reject a deal, while 21 per cent thought it was irrelevant because Mrs May’s deal “is a bad one anyway”.The backstop is a mechanism to ensure there is no hard Border in Ireland after Brexit.The second issue was that 76 per cent of members believed warnings that a no-deal Brexit would cause serious disruption were “exaggerated or invented”.“Tory members – like Tory voters – are utterly unconvinced, despite their own government’s best recent efforts – that a no-deal Brexit would cause serious disruption,” said Prof Bale. “Some 72 per cent of voters currently intending to support the Conservatives think the warnings are ‘exaggerated or invented’ – a figure that rises to 76 per cent among Tory members.“Meanwhile, those members are convinced by a margin of 64 per cent to 19 per cent that leaving without a deal would have a positive rather than a negative effect on Britain’s economy in the medium to long term.”Nearly half (48 per cent) of Tory members think Mrs May is doing fairly badly or very badly as prime minister, and 44 per cent think she should quit if parliament votes to reject her deal.“In short, Mrs May has failed not only to convince the country, and quite probably parliament, that her Brexit deal is a good one, she has also failed to convince the party faithful,” Prof Bale said. “If anything, grassroots Tories are even less impressed than Tory MPs.“If some of those MPs can be persuaded to back the prime minister’s deal, it won’t be because they’ve come under pressure to do so from their local party members over the Christmas break.” – PA"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Yemen has long been a crossroads for trade and communications between Africa and Asia, and the current epidemic is closely linked to recent outbreaks in Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. Cholera is a diarrhoeal disease, transmitted through contaminated food and water, which is most prevalent in regions with poor sanitation. In Yemen, where there has been more than three years of conflict, around 16 million of the 29 million inhabitants have no access to safe water and basic sanitation. “We know that a lack of sanitation and hygiene, population displacement and war are directly linked to large-scale outbreaks,” said Professor Nick Thomson, one of the report’s lead authors. “The difference is that we now know that it’s the movement of the bacterial agent causing cholera across and between countries that links these large-scale outbreaks together.”“In the past we have considered that we are in essence victims to fortune for local pools of the bacterium causing cholera, but we now have a new window into the disease,” he added. Prof Thomson said the research will allow better targeted interventions against cholera and help estimate the risk of future outbreaks in regions like Yemen -potentially reducing the impact of future epidemics. But the researchers, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Institut Pasteur, also found that the strain in Yemen is more susceptible to antibiotics than other types of cholera. “Surprisingly, we discovered the cholera strain causing the Yemen outbreaks is less resistant to antibiotics than related strains,” said Dr Daryl Domman, a visiting scientist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. “The strain causing the Yemeni cholera epidemic has deleted four genes responsible for resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics, making itself more vulnerable to treatment.”Newsletter promotion -

with or without her consent.He initially wrote the name \u0027Gordon\u0027 at the end of the cards but signed them your stalker and your soon to be rapist as they became more sinister.Judge Martin Picton imposed an indefinite restraining order banning him from contacting Ms Lovell or going to the BBC\u0027s regional centre on Whiteladies Road in Bristol.People in the public eye are entitled to the same respect and privacy as everyone else in society, he told Hawthorn.The fact that someone has a high profile does not mean that it can be open season for people such as yourself.A handwritten greetings card sent by Gordon HawthornYou need to understand, as does the public in general, that serious consequences result from appalling behaviour of that kind that features in this case.He said that for two years, Ms Lovell could never be sure that she was safe and was aware, whenever she was on screen, that he would be watching.Hawthorn was caught after DNA tests matched with two of the cards sent to Ms Lovell.When interviewed by Avon and Somerset Police, he admitted he was obsessed with Ms Lovell and said he was disgusted with his actions but laughed after saying he would have carried on had he not been caught.Law and orderRevealed: the world\u0026#39s most punctual airlines – but where does BA rank?\u0026#39Apple have always been better, I don\u0026#39t trust Google\u0026#39 -

or the dark side - is never visible from Earth. Previous spacecraft have seen the far side of the moon, but none has landed on it.The landing lifted the mysterious veil from the far side of the moon, and opened a new chapter in human lunar exploration, the broadcaster said. China launched the Chang\u0027e-4 probe earlier this month, carried by a Long March-3B rocket. It includes a lander and a rover to explore the surface of the moon.An image taken by China\u0026#39s Chang\u0026#39e-4 probe after its landingThe far side of the moon is a rare quiet place that is free from interference of radio signals from Earth, mission spokesman Yu Guobin said, according to Xinhua. This probe can fill the gap of low-frequency observation in radio astronomy and will provide important information for studying the origin of stars and nebula evolution.Unlike the near side of the moon that offers many flat areas to touch down on, the far side is mountainous and rugged.The tasks of the Chang\u0027e-4 include astronomical observation, surveying the moon\u0027s terrain, landform and mineral composition, and measuring the neutron radiation and neutral atoms to study the environment on the far side of the moon.The near side (l) and far side (r) of the Moon show marked differencesChina aims to catch up with Russia and the United States to become a major space power by 2030. It is planning to launch construction of its own manned space station next year.However, while China has insisted its ambitions are purely peaceful, the US Defence Department has accused it of pursuing activities aimed at preventing other nations from using space-based assets during a crisis.Apart from its civilian ambitions, Beijing has tested anti-satellite missiles and the US Congress has banned Nasa from bilateral cooperation with its Chinese counterpart due to security concerns.A simulated landing process of Chang\u0026#39e-4 lunar probe is seen through the monitor at Beijing Aerospace Control Center in BeijingThe United States is so far the only country to have landed humans on the moon. US President Donald Trump said in 2017 he wants to return astronauts to the lunar surface and establish a foundation there for an eventual mission to Mars.It was not until 1959 that the Soviet Union captured the first images of the moon\u0027s mysterious and heavily cratered dark side.No lander or rover has ever previously touched the surface there, and it is no easy technological feat - China has been preparing for this moment for years.The first image of the moon\u0026#39s far side taken by China\u0026#39s Chang\u0026#39e-4 probeA major challenge for such a mission was communicating with the robotic lander: as there is no direct line of sight for signals to the far side of the moon.As a solution, China in May blasted the Queqiao (Magpie Bridge) satellite into the moon\u0027s orbit, positioning it at a \u0027Lagrange point\u0027 so that it can relay data and commands between the lander and Earth.A Lagrange point is a location in space where the combined gravitational forces of two large bodies, such as Earth and the sun or Earth and the moon, equal the centrifugal force felt by a much smaller third body. The interaction of the forces creates a point of equilibrium where a spacecraft may be parked to make observations.In another extreme hurdle, during the lunar night - which lasts 14 Earth days - temperatures drop to as low as minus 173 degrees Celsius (minus 279 Fahrenheit).Long March-3B rocket carrying Chang\u0026#39e 4 lunar probe takes off from the Xichang Satellite Launch CentreDuring the lunar day, also lasting 14 Earth days, temperatures soar as high as 127 C (261 F).The rover\u0027s instruments have to withstand those fluctuations and it has to generate enough energy to sustain it during the long night.The pioneering landing demonstrates China\u0027s growing ambitions as a space power. In 2013, Chang\u0027e 3 was the first spacecraft to land on the moon since the Soviet Union\u0027s Luna 24 in 1976.China plans to send its Chang\u0027e 5 probe to the moon next year and have it return to Earth with samples - the first time that will have been done since 1976. Please review our commenting policyHundreds of German politicians hacked in massive data leakRevealed: the world\u0026#39s most punctual airlines – but where does BA rank?\u0026#39Apple have always been better, I don\u0026#39t trust Google\u0026#39 -  readers react to the week\u0026#39s biggest news storiesLottery winner couple say it \u0026#39will be fun\u0026#39 to give away their £115m New Year\u0026#39s Day jackpotJeremy Hunt warns Russia not to play \u0026#39diplomatic chess games\u0026#39 over British man arrested for spyingOrganised crime gangs are getting jobs in prisons to smuggle in drugs, say policeTheresa May’s Brexit deal is bigger threat to Northern Ireland than no deal, DUP warnsChopper\u0026#39s Brexit Podcast: The Year of BrexitThird woman has entered flashpoint Hindu temple after ban on women liftedDemocrats approve new budget plan to end shutdown - without funds for wall\u0026#39Fat Cat Friday\u0026#39: Top executives\u0026#39 pay overtakes average worker\u0026#39s - in three daysNo-deal Brexit would harm cancer research, universities warn in letterScottish patients \u0026#39forced to wait more than two years\u0026#39 despite Nicola Sturgeon\u0026#39s treatment guaranteeJo Song-gil: The North Korean \u0026#39defector\u0026#39 from Pyongyang\u0026#39s elite who has vital knowledge of regimeTropical Storm Pabuk: Stranded Thailand tourists brace for strong winds and 16 foot wavesWhat happens if Donald Trump is impeached – and who would be the next president?What is impeachment and how long does the process take?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"children should not allowed screentime hour bed","story":"The Royal College urged parents to look at their own smartphone use Children should not be allowed to use screens for an hour before bedtime, according to the first UK guidance for parents.The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said there was no safe amount of total daily screen time, but urged parents to show “tough love” in setting age-appropriate limits.In particular, the advice says parents should take firm action if time on smartphones and videogames is “displacing” other activities - such as sleep, exercise and face-to-face socialising.And its experts urged parents to “practise what they preach” - and spend less time of their leisure time glued to tablets and phones.The guidance comes alongside a systematic review of the scientific evidence regarding the health impact of screen time, published on Friday in BMJ Open.It found moderately strong evidence for a link between greater screen time and depressive symptoms.Researchers said it appeared that the “displacement of positive activities” - in particular, lost sleep, as a result of time spent scrolling - was the most convincing explanation for the link.And they said the impact of blue light on screens on the ability to sleep was likely to be a factor.Dr Max Davie, from the RCPCH, said stopping access to all screens for at least an hour before sleep was a  “sensible rule of thumb”.“The process of going to sleep is a physiological process involving the secretion of melatonin and screens appear to interfere with that,” he said.Researchers said the review also found links between high levels of screen time and excess weight - perhaps because children were likely to consume more snacks while staring at a screen.The college also urged parents to negotiate “age appropriate” boundaries on screen time with children, with firm consequences if such limits were breached.Dr Davie said families needed to ensure that screen time was “under control” - for adults as well as children.“Children do learn from example rather than instruction. It\u0027s difficult to impose strict limits on your children\u0027s screen use if you are constantly on screens yourself. It\u0027s much better to be authoritative about screens if you practise what you preach,” he said.“We suggest that age appropriate boundaries are established, negotiated by parent and child that everyone in the family understands. When these boundaries are not respected, actions need to be put in place with parents making consequences clear.”Four ways to keep your child safe onlineProf Russell Viner, the college’s president, said: “If you are authoritative - tough love and giving clear boundaries and warmth, that works.”The chief medical officer is currently considering setting new recommendations on screen time for children. But the college shied away from recommending a daily screen time limit for all children, saying more research was needed, particularly on the use of social media.So far, many studies on screen time have focussed on television habits, failing to keep up pace with the advent of websites and smart phones.Next week the head of the NHS is expected to unveil plans to expand children\u0027s mental health services to deal with the fallout from an explosion of social media.Simon Stevens has said the NHS has been left “picking up the pieces” of an epidemic of mental illness fuelled by digital overload.It comes after The  launched a duty of care campaign calling for more stringent regulation of sites like Facebook and Instagram, in order to protect children from harm.The expansion of mental health services for children - and the rollout of a four week target for treatment - are expected to form part of a 10-year plan for the NHS.Revealed: the world\u0026#39s most punctual airlines – but where does BA rank?\u0026#39Apple have always been better, I don\u0026#39t trust Google\u0026#39 -  readers react to the week\u0026#39s biggest news storiesLottery winner couple say it \u0026#39will be fun\u0026#39 to give away their £115m New Year\u0026#39s Day jackpotJeremy Hunt warns Russia not to play \u0026#39diplomatic chess games\u0026#39 over British man arrested for spyingOrganised crime gangs are getting jobs in prisons to smuggle in drugs, say policeTheresa May’s Brexit deal is bigger threat to Northern Ireland than no deal, DUP warnsChopper\u0026#39s Brexit Podcast: The Year of BrexitThird woman has entered flashpoint Hindu temple after ban on women liftedDemocrats approve new budget plan to end shutdown - without funds for wall\u0026#39Fat Cat Friday\u0026#39: Top executives\u0026#39 pay overtakes average worker\u0026#39s - in three daysJo Song-gil: The North Korean \u0026#39defector\u0026#39 from Pyongyang\u0026#39s elite who has vital knowledge of regimeNo-deal Brexit would harm cancer research, universities warn in letterScottish patients \u0026#39forced to wait more than two years\u0026#39 despite Nicola Sturgeon\u0026#39s treatment guaranteeTropical Storm Pabuk: Stranded Thailand tourists brace for strong winds and 16 foot wavesWhat happens if Donald Trump is impeached – and who would be the next president?What is impeachment and how long does the process take?Councils urged to price motorists off road by NHS watchdogWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 4 january 2019","story":"John Smiles, an employee of Oldroyd\u0027s rhubarb growers in Carlton, near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, UK, picks this year\u0027s crop of forced rhubarb.

They remained under police protection on Friday.The third to enter the temple, on Thursday night, was a Sri Lankan woman, police said.She entered the temple yesterday night. She is 47 years old and came as a devotee. We were aware and watched the situation, Balram Kumar Upadhyay, a police official, told AFP.Indian protesters throw stones at police during a demonstration over two women entering the Sabarimala Ayyapa templeUpadhyay said that the situation at the temple on Friday was normal for now.Thousands of Hindu hardliners, many of them female, had previously succeeded in preventing women from accessing the site in the weeks following the landmark ruling, with some hardliners throwing stones at police and assaulting female journalists.Wednesday\u0027s news sparked uproar among Hindu devotees, including many in Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u0027s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who believe that women of menstruating age should not enter the temple because the diety it is dedicated to, Ayyappa, was celibate.Clashes on Wednesday and Thursday between devotees, activists of Kerala\u0027s ruling leftist alliance and riot police firing tear gas and water cannon, left one man dead and at least 15 people injured, including four who were stabbed.Police said that 1,369 people have been arrested, and that the situation on the ground on Friday was peaceful but tense.Much of the sporadic violence took place as Hindu hardliners sought to force shopkeepers to comply with a dawn-til-dusk hartal shutdown called by the Sabarimala temple hierarchy, media reports said.On Tuesday tens of thousands of women, in an initiative backed by the state government, had formed a huge human chain called the Women\u0027s Wall across Kerala to back the demand access.The Supreme Court is to start hearing a legal challenge on its temple ruling - the latest in a series of verdicts to upset traditionalists and reflect a more liberal outlook in Indian society - from January 22.Women are barred from a handful of Hindu temples in India. The entry of women of menstruating age to Sabarimala was taboo for generations and formalised by the Kerala High Court in 1991.Please review our commenting policyRevealed: the world\u0026#39s most punctual airlines – but where does BA rank?\u0026#39Apple have always been better, I don\u0026#39t trust Google\u0026#39 -

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave.

There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHRounding off the top five were the soundtrack of\u0026nbspMamma Mia!

One thing many cryptocurrency analysts\u0026nbspagree upon is that price volatility will steadily decrease, thanks to a combination of its finite supply and regulation designed to help the market\u0026nbspstabilise and mature.Bitcoin price predictions for 2019: From $0 to $36,000, experts weigh Whilst some critics still argue, for varying reasons, as to the longevity of\u0026nbspbitcoin, the next 10 years should at the very least provide many more talking points and events to document its life,\u0026nbspDavid Thomas, director of Mayfair-based cryptocurrency broker\u0026nbspGlobalBlock, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.If, as expected, increased regulation enters the market then bitcoin will be opened up to a broader investor base, and with increased adoption, we expect to see volatility reduce and stability increase both of which will establish bitcoin and cryptocurrencies further as an asset class in their own right.10th birthday has prompted speculation about the cryptocurrency\u0027s future (Rock Star Pastries Composite)Bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology is also expected to continue to drive an entire industry of new applications.\u0026nbspVladislav Dramaliev, head of digital marketing at aeternity, believes this is where bitcoin\u0027s real promise lies.Mr\u0026nbspDramaliev\u0026nbspdescribes bitcoin\u0027s inception as starting a curious revolution, but believes the word evolution will be more appropriate to describe the next decade of bitcoin and blockchain\u0027s growth.One of the most incredible developments is that, 10 years after that first block was mined, there is actually a whole\u0026nbspindustry\u0026nbspbased around this fantastic technology. Today we have a mind-bogglingly erse range of iniduals and companies in the sphere, covering every possible spectrum of opinion, vision for the future, and agenda, he said.The public blockchain infrastructure is getting better and better, more developers are getting interested in blockchain applications, more entrepreneurs are looking for the next killer app, and more users are playing with digital assets on a blockchain. I don’t expect this process to slow down. Everyone looks at Bitcoin and sees something different, depending on their own background.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/13/20/house-building-0.jpg","title":"brexit services purchasing managers index december","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

If a Brexit deal is agreed soon, growth will surely rise this year.The services PMI covers sectors such as hotels, restaurants, transport and finance, although not retail.Separately, the Bank of England reported on Friday that unsecured lending to British households slowed to an annual rate of 7.1 per cent in November, the slowest rate\u0026nbspsince March 2015.The number of new mortgage approvals for house purchases also fell to 63,728 in the month, well below the expectations of City of London analysts.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Averse to exercise. You see him on the Vitality posters on the Underground. It’s a clever advertising ploy because the point is to get you to do more exercise. And the surprising thing – if you look more closely – is it’s all about insurance.It used to be you bought life or health insurance, stuck the paperwork in a drawer, and then forgot about it, until you got ill or they called for the priest. That has all changed – as Herschel Mayers, CEO of Vitality, explained to me. Born in Zimbabwe, he was brought up in Johannesburg, and ides his time between South Africa and London. After a few years with Liberty, Mayers co-founded Discovery Life, now the largest insurer in South Africa. He joined forces with Prudential in 2014 to set up Vitality. Now 58, he trained as an actuary, so he’s good at mathematics and statistics and probabilities and improbabilities. But stick with me here, because he is also good at making it simple. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPersonal confession: many moons ago I turned down the opportunity to go about selling insurance because I thought of it as too doom-laden and didn’t want to scare the pants off people (“You know you’re going to die, don’t you? Stop kidding yourself, you’d better be prepared!”).The genius of Herschel Mayers lies in changing the narrative. He has spun insurance around 180 degrees and turned it away from being about dying or getting ill and made it all about keeping fit and well and living longer. He made me feel healthier just talking to him. A View from the Top: ViaVan London chief Jess Oppetit A View from the Top: SlimFast boss Lindsay Reisser-WestonHouzz CEO Adi Tatarko on running a $4bn internet startup A View from the Top: Jacqueline de Rojas on discrimination in techVitality has a so-called “wellness philosophy”, but this isn’t as hazy and airy-fairy as it sounds. You know all those good intentions you blithely announce around New Year and then it all goes to pot until the next round of solemn promises? Mr Mayers doesn’t want you to revert to couch potato. “Everyone knows that smoking is bad for you and exercise is good,” says Mayers. The interesting question he asks is, “How do you get people to change their behaviour for the better?” His answer is more carrot than stick – or, as it is now known, “behavioural economics”. This is how it works: you sign up to Vitality. Vitality straight off the bat gives you a 40 per cent discount, providing you agree to go to the gym regularly. And they give you juicy little incentives along the way if you stick by your commitment – free cinema tickets, coffee at Starbucks, an Amazon Prime subscription. The benevolent Mr Mayers is, in effect, paying you to keep hitting the cross-trainer or doing your 10,000 steps every day. The more steps, the less smoking, the better the incentive. Conversely, your discount is “eroded” over time if you slack and go back to your bad old ways. Can’t I just phone in or email to say how good I’ve been? Mayers has anticipated my would-be cunning deception. “That’s why we give you an ‘activity tracker’. We monitor your good behaviour.” So you actually have to clock in at the gym. They know if your heartbeat goes up or not. “It has to be verifiable,” says Mayers. So don’t think you can just sneak outside and have a quick fag. Such is the joy of social media. “We have daily interaction.”But, I can’t help wondering, isn’t that a bit tyrannical? \u0026nbsp“It would be, if we were forcing you,” says Mayers, reasonably enough. “But we’re not forcing you, it’s your choice to buy into the system in the first place. You don’t have to do it. But it makes more sense.” The logic of the deal is the “shared value model”, developed originally by Professor Michael E Porter at Harvard, a theory Mayers has translated into practice. The Vitality customer or “member” is given a subtle (or not so subtle) “nudge” in the direction of staying in better nick for longer. The value, or benefit, is shared by both the insured – who gets to enjoy life more, both quantitatively and qualitatively – and the insurer, who pays out less on claims. Everyone is a winner, including the nation as a whole, which gets one more useful and productive citizen to add to the GDP, and the NHS, which has one less chronically ill patient to look after for years on end. “By changing behaviour,” says Mayers, “we want to create additional economic value.” Call me a nanny-state guy if you will, but, realistically, when you’re up against the proliferation of cardiac-inducing fast food and fried chicken outlets, you need to do something to try and level the playing field. It’s not exactly King Canute trying to hold back the tide, it’s more Canute, or in this case Vitality, providing everyone (or at least the million or so members of the club) with surfboards to skim across the waves rather than just sit there on your backside getting swamped. “We are making a difference,” says Mayers. “People do go for check-ups and our claims are lower.” The Harvard-inspired theory is working so well that Mayers has now extended it into the realm of investing or saving. You know that other good intention you have, to put a bit aside from your wages for your retirement? And you know how it would be better to start sooner rather than later, ideally in your twenties? “Everyone knows this, but they don’t do it,” says Mayers. Well, guess who is going to give you a gentle nudge in that general direction? Vitality’s persuader in this case is a 20 per cent bonus at the end of it, when you collect your pension payout – providing you’ve behaved well and haven’t started too late or withdrawn it all too soon. Makes sense to me, so much so I suggested it to my two twenty-something sons. They scoffed (as is their wont). “But they are offering all these incentives,” I said. “Maybe they could consider paying off our student debt then,” they said.A View from the TopOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

If a Brexit deal is agreed soon, growth will surely rise this year.The services PMI covers sectors such as hotels, restaurants, transport and finance, although not retail.Separately, the Bank of England reported on Friday that unsecured lending to British households slowed to an annual rate of 7.1 per cent in November, the slowest rate\u0026nbspsince March 2015.The number of new mortgage approvals for house purchases also fell to 63,728 in the month, well below the expectations of City of London analysts.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A society that values its teachers, care workers and nurses at less than 1 per cent of a FTSE CEO is beyond broken.”Extreme inequality has been found to lead to higher higher levels of mental and physical ill health, obesity, drug and alcohol addiction and lower levels of trust and educational attainment.\u0026nbspPeter Cheese, the chief executive of the CIPD, suggested that soaring executive pay also contributes to the current political turmoil.“Excessive pay packages awarded by remuneration committees represent a significant failure in corporate governance and perpetuate the idea of a ‘superstar’ business leader when business is a collective endeavour and reward should be shared more fairly. This imbalance does nothing to help heal the many social and economic ides facing the country,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

In a decision made public on Thursday 3 January, district judge Louis Stanton said there were “substantial similarities between several of the two works’ musical elements”.\u0026nbspHe also ruled that it was disputed whether the harmonic rhythm of “Let’s Get It On”, which was released in 1973 and hit number one in the US charts, was deserving of copyright protection, or whether it was too common.

Released in 2014, it went on to become the first single to spend a full year in the UK top 40, and the first to be streamed over 500m times on Spotify. It won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance and Song of the Year at the 58th Grammy Awards in 2016.The lawsuit against Sheeran was brought by the estate and heirs of late producer Ed Townsend, who co-wrote “Let’s Get It On” with Gaye. It names Sheeran, his co-writer Amy Wadge, SonyATC Music Publishing and Atlantic Records as defendants.The defence argued that “Thinking Out Loud” is characterised by “sombre, melancholic tones” that address “long-lasting romantic love”, while “Let’s Get It On” is considered\u0026nbspa “sexual anthem”.\u0026nbspSheeran has previously been accused of plagiarism over his songs “Photograph” and “Shape of You”.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations.

Many are experiencing very real hardship as the flawed system of universal credit is rolled out. Meanwhile, it is a national scandal that FTSE CEO fat cats have creamed off even more pay this year.\u0026nbsp“We can all see that this rampant inequality is damaging UK society. A society that values its teachers, care workers and nurses at less than 1 per cent of a FTSE CEO is beyond broken.”Extreme inequality has been found to lead to higher higher levels of mental and physical ill health, obesity, drug and alcohol addiction and lower levels of trust and educational attainment.\u0026nbspPeter Cheese, the chief executive of the CIPD, suggested that soaring executive pay also contributes to the current political turmoil.“Excessive pay packages awarded by remuneration committees represent a significant failure in corporate governance and perpetuate the idea of a ‘superstar’ business leader when business is a collective endeavour and reward should be shared more fairly. This imbalance does nothing to help heal the many social and economic ides facing the country,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Without the constraints of physical controls, these virtual tools can take on the fluidity and precision of our natural human hand motion.Project\u0026nbspSoli\u0026nbspFounder Ivan\u0026nbspPouyrev\u0026nbspexplained his motivation behind the endeavour in a video posted in 2015.Capturing the possibilities of human hands was one of my passions, he said. How could we take this incredible capability, the finesse of human actions, and apply it to the virtual world?He explained that\u0026nbspthe technology can fit onto a single chip measuring\u0026nbsp8mm\u0026nbspby\u0026nbsp10mm, allowing it to fit in a large variety of devices.What is most exciting about it is that you can shrink the entire radar and put it in a tiny chip, he said.\u0026nbspThat\u0027s what makes this approach so promising.

The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2740 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2840 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2940 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3040 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3140 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3240 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3340 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3440 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3540 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3640 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3740 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.3840 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany3940 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4040 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 140 Breeding with neanderthals helped humans fight diseasesOn migrating from Africa around 70,000 years ago, humans bumped into the neanderthals of Eurasia. While humans were weak to the diseases of the new lands, breeding with the resident neanderthals made for a better equipped immune system240 Daily aspirin is unnecessary for older people in good health, study findsA study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has found that many elderly people are taking daily aspirin to little or no avail340 Vaping could lead to cancer, US study findsA study by the University of Minnesota\u0027s Masonic Cancer Centre has found that the carcinogenic chemicals formaldehyde, acrolein, and methylglyoxal are present in the saliva of E-cigarette users440 More children are obese and diabetic540 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide640 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugar740 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active940 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.1040 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.1140 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.1240 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.1340 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.1440 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 1540 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues1640 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.1740 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.1840 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.1940 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.2040 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded2140 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively2240 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2440 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity.

Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. The research shows even modest sleep deprivation can undermine\u0026nbspchildren’s mental and physical health, educational success and family relations,\u0026nbspand there is a plausible biological reason why screen use could be disruptive.“Going to sleep involves the production of melatonin, and screens appear to interfere with that process, the evidence is emerging but we think that’s a sensible rule of thumb,” Dr Davie added.Facebook became the latest app to introduce a “dark mode” for its instant messaging service\u0026nbspwhich reduces levels of blue light that have stoked health fears. However the RCPCH review said there wasn’t enough evidence to support blue light being particularly harmful and any bright light can disrupt sleep.The college called for more education for parents to help them set healthy patterns of screen use, and understand issues with screens such as age rating certificates for violent video games.“But we know, undoubtedly, that if a child is spending most of their day on screens, they will be not doing the physical activity, sleeping, the stuff that is beneficial.”Independent experts welcomed guidelines, particularly the close focus on evidence, but said they may not be detailed enough to help many parents.Professor Stephen Scott, director of the national academy for parenting research the King\u0027s College London said: The notion that it should stop one hour before bedtime is welcome, but more detail on exactly how to turn off Wi-Fi access and keep smart phones out of the bedroom would help parents.\u0026nbspLikewise it would have been good to have some specific number of hours recommended, e.g. one hour a day doing weekdays, perhaps 2 to 3 hours at weekends, or whatever a family feels comfortable with.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Chief Medical Officer has commissioned a systematic evidence review on the impact of social media use on young people’s mental health. Later this year we will also publish our proposals to tackle online harm and set clear responsibilities for tech companies to keep people safe, which will consider young people and social media.”Royal College of Paediatrics and Child HealthOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

In a strange run of events, Apple froze trading on its stock and was forced to announce that its results were about to disappoint its investors.The announcement was meant primarily for Apple\u0027s shareholders, and the wide circle of analysts and financial markets that revolve around them. Tim Cook\u0027s letter announcing the change was addressed to its investors, and included information intended for them.As an indication of how rare such a statement\u0026nbspis, Apple has not done this since 2002 – long before the iPhone, and just months into the iPod era.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialFor investors and Apple itself, it\u0027s a worrying announcement about the future of the iPhone, and an admission that it was not going where it thought. That has happened for a whole host of reasons – many of them not really connected to the iPhone itself, or even Apple.But the announcement could make a difference to Apple fans and iPhone users in a wide variety of not immediately obvious ways, some of which could be positive. It is one of the most important announcements about the future of its star handset that Apple has ever made, and so will matter in some small way to everyone who uses an iPhone or will do in the future.It matters, primarily, because Apple said that people are not buying as many iPhones\u0026nbspas expected, or as it needed to sell to ensure that its investors were happy. That, in turn, means that it will most likely adjust its strategy to try and make people buy more.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

But others revolve around central parts of Apple\u0027s strategy, which touch on all of its customers.In his letter announcing the weaker than expected results, Mr\u0026nbspCook cited a number of reasons to the drop. He pointed above all to weakness in China\u0027s economy – in part caused by an ongoing trade war between it and the US – but he also said that there were problems elsewhere, too.Chief among the other reasons for Apple\u0027s weaker than expected performance is likely to be the higher prices that it has started to charge for its iPhones, as well as other products.Gradually, Apple has pushed up the prices for both the cheapest versions of its new phones and the ones at the very top of the line. Over the last couple of years, Apple has changed its pricing strategy so that the cheapest model of the phone – the XR, which starts at $749 – would have been at the top end in the years that went before.As well as leading people to think twice about whether they can afford or want to pay that much for a new iPhone, the higher prices came at the same time Apple announced a wide-ranging and heavily discounted program to allow people to replace their phone\u0027s batteries. That came in response to a controversy that raged at Christmas last year, amid\u0026nbspsuggestions that Apple was intentionally slowing down old phones.Apple suggested that a higher-than-expected number of people taking up that deal – presumably in part because the battery replacements were so cheap, and a whole new phone was so expensive – had also helped dampen demand. At the same time, Apple made keeping an old phone more appealing in other ways, such as the new iOS 12 update that sped older handsets\u0026nbspup dramatically.That as well as other factors mean that people are holding onto their old iPhones for a longer period of time. And that means they\u0027re not buying new ones, hurting Apple.The company\u0027s response is still unknown and could come in a variety of forms. Apple might choose to cut the price of its most expensive models in future, for instance, meaning that the next phone will cost less it could also try and ramp up improvements in the coming years to ensure that the new handsets remain more compelling.Whatever happens, Apple appears to have been forced to realise that it has pushed the top end of the iPhone\u0027s pricing too far. Customers have given their verdict by just not buying the phones – and it will now be Apple\u0027s turn to try and convince them otherwise.It might also be that Apple turns towards its other products, at the same time, in an attempt to ersify away from the handset that represents a vast part of its profits. It has already been looking to focus on services such as Apple Music to ensure that customers still give it money even after they\u0027ve bought their products, and has been branching out further into accessories with the release of the AirPods, HomePod and more.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/18/13/Jeremy-Corbyn-John-McDonnell.jpg","title":"four day working week jeremy corbyn job work automation retirement ageism","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Ben Chu investigatesClick to followThe IndependentShadow chancellor John McDonnell (right) has suggested Labour could include a pledge to reduce the working week in its next manifestoAs a society we can’t seem to make up our minds about work. Do we want more of it? Or less?There’s a chilling fog of fear over what technological advances will mean for our jobs, with an endless supply of alarming forecasts about how robots and algorithms are set to displace human workers.But there’s also a furnace of angst about low productivity and under-investment by firms in just the kind of innovations that induce those nightmares of a “jobs apocalypse”.Boss wants to make four-day working week trial permanentSome lament the supposed proliferation of pointless, soul-dismantling, “bullshit jobs”.

But for others the big problem is ageism, the risk of being pressured out of jobs they enjoy prematurely.When it comes to work, we’re rather like those two diners in the Catskill mountains: “Boy, the food at this place is really terrible... Yeah, I know and such small portions.”Yet onto this terrain of confusion and apparent contradiction some stride confidently.To Alex Williams, a Corbynite academic, automation should be embraced by the left as the emancipation of labour, provided the gains are comprehensively redistributed.The Trades Union Congress seems to have been influenced by this cocktail of technological optimism and socialist assertion. Its general secretary\u0026nbspFrances O’Grady\u0026nbsprecently demanded a four-day week by the end of the century, declaring: “Bosses and shareholders must not be allowed to hoover up all the gains from new tech for themselves.”The Labour Party is keen too. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell has made favourable noises about the four-day week and is reported to be asking the crossbench peer, Robert Skidelsky, to head an inquiry into the subject.Yet this isn’t just a British story. There are tectonic rumblings from abroad too. The IG Metall union in Germany earlier this year won the right to a four-day week for its almost 900,000 members. One technology start-up, founded by former Google employees, has a “Free Friday” policy. Even a think tank close to the authorities in China has called for the most populous nation on the planet to have a four-day working week as soon as 2030.Any project that can unite German metal bashers, Silicon Valley coders and Chinese Communist apparatchiks clearly has an unusually wide appeal.So is the four-day week a big idea whose time has come? Or is it an unworkable left-wing fantasy? And even if a four-day week is economically feasible, should we really desire it? Or is it a case of being careful what you wish for?When Marei Wollersberger and her colleagues established an east London-based data design agency, Normally, as a four-day week operation in 2014, the motivation was largely personal.“We wanted to lead happier lives basically – enjoy ourselves more, not just to defer our enjoyment to retirement age,” she told me.But there was another goal: “There was also a motivation to be more productive.”The economics of the four-day week revolve around the concept of productivity, the amount we produce per hour worked.The size of the economy – the size of our national income – is derived from the value of all the goods and services produced by businesses and households.On the face of it, if we all worked one less day a week, our personal output would drop by around fifth. Multiply that fall across the overall economy and you’ve got an economy that is considerably smaller, implying lower income and lower living standards for all, one way or another.Yet what if working fewer hours were to stimulate our productivity? What if we produced more per hour working four days than we did per hour working five?In that case there might be no overall drop in total output, and therefore no decrease in living standards. If our productivity rose enough we might even have a higher income than we did before.Wollersberger says the model has worked in stimulating performance at her company. “You’re more productive – you achieve exactly the same or more in four days as you would in five,” she says. “And I honestly believe it’s better work.”\u0026nbspA New Zealand financial firm called Perpetual  found similarly gratifying results when it trialled a four-day week recently.“There was broadly no change in company outputs pre and during the trial,” said its boss. “No reduction in job performance and the survey data showed a marginal increase across most teams.”Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Bear in mind that no change in output despite a fifth less time at work implies a stunning increase in productivity.But beware cherry-picking. The results of a Swedish trial involving 70 nurses working a six-hour day were more mixed. While there was some boost to worker productivity, the city of Gothenburg also had to hire more nurses to cover the hours lost.Intuitively, this seems much more likely to be the result of moving to a four-day week in services sectors that are, currently at least, heavily reliant on face-to-face human interactions such as healthcare or teaching.That’s not to imply the shift in working patterns should be ruled out as impractical. There are benefits in terms of lower stress and happiness to set against those financial costs. But it’s probably unrealistic to expect the move to always pay for itself, at least in the short-term.And some experiments have flopped. Treehouse, an online educational firm in Oregon, was one of those companies which got media publicity for its four-day week in 2015. But Treehouse’s founder recently lamented that the working practice killed the work ethic in his company and called the experiment a “terrible thing”.The only way is down?Inidual “micro” trials are certainly useful, but they aren’t necessarily a reliable guide to “macro” economic impacts.The closest thing that we have to a state-mandated four-day week is France’s 35-hour week, introduced in 2000 under the Jacques Chirac-Lionel Jospin cohabitation.Jospin\u0026nbsp(left) and president Jaques Chirac (right) (AFPGetty)The first thing to bear in mind is that this does not mean all French people work a four-day week. The regulation simply means overtime kicks in after a worker has completed 35 hours and they accrue the right to holiday lieu days. Yet it does establish a social norm of fewer hours and a financial incentive for firms to limit them.Opinions are mixed about its results. France has a high unemployment rate relative to the UK and other developed countries and it’s notable that Emmanuel Macron campaigned for president promising to increase the flexibility of the system.And though the level of French productivity stands comparison with the most productive nations in the world, there’s no evidence that its growth rate has risen since it introduced the 35-hour week.This might incline us to scepticism about the value of the the state having any role in limiting working hours.\u0026nbspYet that could be the wrong conclusion. For the historic trend is clear. In the late 1900s, UK workers put in more than 2,500 hours a year on average. That’s down to 1,680 hours in 2017. There’s been a similar steep fall in other developed countries over the past century and a half.That reflects the fact that the five-day working week, as opposed to six days with only Sunday off, only become standard practice in the 20th century.It was the industrialist Henry Ford who was the pioneer in the US, giving his factory workers a five-day shift in 1926 while keeping their wages steady. This prefigured legislation and Congress’ 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, which mandated a maximum 40-hour working week (effectively five working days).We primarily think of John Maynard Keynes as the great promoter of employment for his pioneering theories on the economic benefits of government-funded job creation during the Great Depression.\u0026nbspBut it was this secular decline in hours worked, despite the agonising surge in unemployment in the 1930s, that led Keynes to look forward to a 15-hour working week in The Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren by the year 2000.The question is whether the recent flattening out is the end of the decline in hours worked,\u0026nbspor merely a pause.\u0026nbspAnd is a government nudge necessary to get history moving again?There’s also the question of consumption. One of the reasons Henry Ford instituted a five-day working week was revealed in a 1926 interview: “Leisure is an indispensable ingredient in a growing consumer market because working people need to have enough free time to find uses for consumer products, including automobiles.”In other words, it was less a paternalistic concern for his workers’ well-being\u0026nbspthan a recognition that it would create help create more customers for Ford.There’s an echo of this macroeconomic concern today, with government-linked Beijing researchers suggesting a four-day week could boost the domestic tourism and entertainment sectors and help rebalance the overall Chinese economy to consumption and away from excessive investment.But perhaps the major economic question about moving towards a four-day week is whether it\u0026nbspcould somehow boost our long-term productivity growth rate (perhaps by inducing more investment in automation by firms) or whether a shorter working week could only ever be the fruits of productivity growth with an origin elsewhere.The truth is that we don’t know the answer. Yet it’s vital to recognise that countries and societies have autonomy too, even now.\u0026nbspThe US has a considerably larger GDP per capita than any developed country in Europe. But the bulk of this gap is due not to a vastly higher level of productivity but the fact that Americans, on average, work many more hours than the French, Germans or Swiss or British and so on.The trade-off between work and leisure is different between our two continents. Both Europeans and Americans, by global and historical comparisons, have very comfortable standards of living. Choosing more leisure over extra working hours is not, whatever some might employers might argue, necessarily a route to penury and decline.Doing nothing for ever and everThe Victorian historian and essayist Thomas Carlyle believed in the redemptive power of work.“A man perfects himself by working,” he enthused. “Foul jungles are cleared away, fair seed-fields rise instead, and stately cities ... Even in the meanest sorts of labour, the whole soul of a man is composed into a kind of real harmony the instant he sets himself to work.”The (possibly apocryphal) epitaph on a Hertfordshire gravestone took a different view of the intrinsic value of hard labour.“Here lies a poor woman who always was tired​”One does not need to be a Carlyle-style work zealot to appreciate that there is some intrinsic psychological value to labour. Work is where many of us find not just an income, but friends, stimulation and status. But we can also see where that Hertfordshire washerwoman was coming from.This dichotomy underlines that not all jobs are the same, or are experienced the same by the worker. For every occupation that that does help to clear away someone’s jungles of mental disorder there will be one that is felt as detestable drudgery.One of the deficiencies of the debate over the four-day week, as with discussions of the appropriate retirement age, is a failure to acknowledge the vast ersity of both jobs and workers. Labour is not homogeneous.Working until 70 might seem entirely reasonable, even desirable, to the university professor, the politician or the TV presenter. But to the cleaner, the firefighter or shop assistant – especially jobs with a physically arduous component – it may have considerably less appeal.\u0026nbspAnd so views erge too on the desirability of the four-day week.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Frances Connolly, 52,  and Patrick Connolly, 54, from Moira, County Armagh in Northern Ireland, who scooped a £115 million EuroMillions jackpot in the New Year\u0027s Day lottery draw, during a photocall at the Culloden Estate and Spa in Holywood, Belfast, as they announce their winThe offshore patrol vessel HMS Mersey leaves Portsmouth Harbour as it is deployed to patrol the English channel following an increase in migrants crossing in small boatsRail protestors wearing masks with the faces of Prime Minister Theresa May and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling outside Kings Cross St Pancras station in London ahead of a visit by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to highlight \u0027rising rail fares and falling standards of service on Britain\u0027s railways\u0027 as part of Labour\u0027s Rail Action DayPolice restraining a man after he stabbed three people at Victoria Station in Manchester last night.

He confirmed he will remain in post and thinks it is important to continue working with Cabinet colleagues to ensure the best Brexit outcome for the countryOne of the most significant developments in the UK and broader Western economy over the past decade is the rise of the gig economy and self-employment. Around a sixth of the British workforce is now self-employed.This was brought home to me recently when I met the Romanian father of one of the friends of my young son. The father had been a chauffeur for a wealthy family in Chelsea. But he’d resigned after his son had started school and had signed on with Uber so he could pick his lad up directly from school and shift his driving work to airport shuttle-runs at night instead. “I wanted the flexibility and my previous employer couldn’t provide that,” he told me, as we watched our boys career around the playground.His work-life balance was not to be found in limiting the hours he worked (indeed he wanted to keep those the same or even increase them) but in the flexibility of his arrangements.Survey evidence suggests this is a common story. The majority of Uber drivers like the personal control over their working hours made possible by the platform. Drivers who valued flexible working reported higher levels of life satisfaction, as well as lower levels of anxiety.However, there was also a minority of Uber drivers who would prefer to work fixed hours in a more conventional work setting. And these workers reported lower levels of life satisfaction and higher levels of anxiety.A question of representationThis brings us back to the apparent paradox of many people in the UK workforce wanting fewer hours but many others wanting more.\u0026nbspDavid Bell, a labour market economist from the University of Stirling\u0026nbspwhose work, along with Danny Blanchflower of Dartmouth College in the US, has highlighted this ergence, says that the groups who want fewer hours tend to be older, while those who are underemployed seem to be younger.One of the implications is that younger people in the workforce may need the money from more hours because they are under greater financial pressure, perhaps because they have families, or perhaps because they have suffered a greater real wage squeeze since the financial crisis.\u0026nbspThis suggests that Corbynite left is correct in stressing that to consider the economic and social case for a four-day in isolation is a mistake. Incomes plainly matter too, as well as the level of inequality.\u0026nbspOne has to consider the role of income redistribution and employment policies. Give people higher incomes and more “outside options” for employment, perhaps through a jobs guarantee or even a universal basic income, and the desire for extra hours in their current job may well melt away. They may begin to make different work-leisure trade-offs than they do now.Perhaps one of the reasons why we some people languish in ultra-flexible gig economy jobs they don’t appreciate – like those disgruntled Uber drivers – is that, despite what most economic analysts say, there is actually hidden slack in our economy – and that if the slack was eradicated they could find the kind of regular job they wanted elsewhere.But that still leaves a circle to be squared, presuming that different people, all else equal, are still likely to put different weights on work and leisure. How do we give those who would prefer a four-day week more freedom to choose it, while protecting the interests of those who don’t?The empowerment of ordinary workers is Professor Bell’s answer. Let inidual employees have substantive input into determining the trade-off, rather than leaving it up to politicians or employers.This is how I know the NHS won’t survive without EU staffOver a million young women say they’re paid less than male colleaguesDJ jailed for raping boy, 3, in toilet at working men’s clubTrailblazing images of early 20th-century working conditions“One of the things that might help is a strengthening of worker representation, which has declined so dramatically,” he says. “Rather than jumping in to impose a four-day week you want to think first about whether workers’ interests are being properly represented.”This would be going with the historical grain, given the driving role of new trade unions in the achievement of an eight-hour working day in the 19th century and early 20th century.It’s notable not only that IG Metall workers in Germany this year were able to achieve a four-day working week through negotiation with bosses – but that they also had sufficient bargaining power to protect their overall levels of weekly pay.A fundamental question that underpins this broad discussion about the future of working hours is a philosophical one: what makes us happy and fulfilled as human beings?Modern psychological studies do partially back up Carlyle’s Victorian pompous sermonising: formal work can be as positive for human happiness as leisure, sometimes more so.\u0026nbspA job does seem to bring a valuable sense of social usefulness. Involuntary unemployment is clearly harmful for people’s mental health.But how much work do we want or need? Keynes in the 1930s called this desire for work “old Adam” and predicted that three hours a day in the future would be “quite enough to satisfy” this inherited instinct.Perhaps the right thing to do is not to dictate to people, or engage in speculation on what the future of work will look like, but rather to help them decide for themselves.Four day working weekOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

As a new book points out, it’s an essentially selfish state of being, and society should stop chasing this illusion because it’ll only make us miserable. Even if you do own an orgasmatron...Click to followThe IndependentSurfing is similar to happiness: it’s all about feeling good within yourself. It’s an internal, physiological and emotional state. Which means it is devoid of any moralityThomas Jefferson made it a constitutional right in the US. “The pursuit of happiness.”\u0026nbspYou have the right to pursue wellbeing. No one is stopping you. Go ahead and pursue it. But when did a right morph into an obligation, a duty?The founding fathers were influenced by the great voyages of discovery. Thanks to Captain Cook and his French counterpart Bougainville, the idea got about that everyone in the southern hemisphere was happier than in the cold and dismal north. We had the technology, we had the “civilisation”, but why didn’t we feel good about it? They had something we were lacking. Surfing was a case in point. According to European observers, the men and women riding waves had found a way to “allay all perturbation of mind”. The American constitution was, in effect, suggesting we ought to try living our lives on the crest of a wave.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI personally put the utopian theory to the test by following in Cook’s footsteps and going to the Sandwich Islands, aka Hawaii, aka “the Happy Isles of Oceania” (according to Paul Theroux). By a strange quirk of fate one of the first people I met there was a clinical psychologist. “Where are you from?”, she said. “England,” I replied. “You’re so lucky!” she said. I had just travelled several thousand miles to get away from England and here was someone telling me I was better off saving my money and staying put. “How do you work that out?” I asked. “The great thing about England,” she replied, “is that you can be miserable and nobody minds. In fact you’re expected to be miserable.”It turned out that she was a specialist in treating people with depression. “In Hawaii?” I said with genuine scepticism. They have palm trees, sultry breezes, and big waves, what was the problem? “People get depressed in Hawaii the same as anywhere else,” she said. “The problem is that here you’re expected to be happy. So you feel guilty about it on top. And then considering Hawaii is also technically the 50th state of America, if you’re broke too, when you’re supposed to be prosperous, then you’re really screwed.”You don’t have to be miserable, but it’s your constitutional right to be downhearted if you want to be. What he demonstrates so convincingly is how feeling good can really be bad for youDr Depression surely had a point. But she represents the opposition to what has become increasingly a vast and powerful and highly profitable industry, as Carl Cederström sets out in his wise and witty new book, The Happiness Fantasy. He might equally well have called it the “happiness conspiracy”, because we are being ganged up on, bullied and battered and bruised by the imperative of happiness. Can’t we just be unhappy if we feel like it? What’s so bad about that?I know I’m going to come over as the biggest party pooper, grouch or grinch in the history of the world here, but I can never really sing “Happy Birthday” to anyone with any degree of conviction or enthusiasm. I do still occasionally send birthday cards, but I’m not going to write the words “happy birthday” in black and white. It always seems too coercive to me. My attitude is OK, be happy if you like, but if you want to be unhappy that’s good too, you shouldn’t have to feel like you have to be happy. Happiness ought to be voluntary and accidental and spontaneous and strictly optional. (So what do I write? “Be awesome”? It’s tricky. Suggestions on a postcard, please.)TherouxCederström comes from Stockholm. He is more of an exponent of Nordic noir. No palm trees in Scandi-land, so far as I know. Only bracing, even lacerating minimalism. Don’t get me wrong. Cederström is not advocating despair. Maybe he is even trying to save you from Hawaiian-style depression. You don’t have to be miserable, but it’s your constitutional right to be downhearted if you want to be. What he demonstrates so convincingly is how feeling good can really be bad for you.According to Philip Larkin, sex was invented – or at least re-invented – sometime between the publication of Lady Chatterley’s Lover and the Beatles’ first LP, around 1963. “Happiness,” as Freud said, “comes from the satisfaction of needs that have been dammed up to a high degree.” But what if they are not dammed up? Then we are looking at futile or self-destructive overexertion. Instead of being an episodic phenomenon, sex turned into our lodestar, our archetype of mood-management. Thanks in part to Wilhelm Reich, the orgasm was no longer an exceptional high, it became the model of how we were ought to be feeling generally. Way up there on Cloud 9. Average was no longer good enough. But the idea that everyone should really be feeling well beyond average all the time – having constant “peak experiences” (in Abraham Maslow’s phrase) meant that there was always going to be lot of disappointed customers.Reich was an Austrian, originally a disciple of Freud’s, who broke with him over Freud’s notion of sublimation. Civilisation, said Freud, depends on you bottling up all that libinidal energy of yours, and channelling it into doing something creative, like writing novels, composing symphonies or building bridges and tall buildings. Rubbish, said Reich. The orgasm (no ordinary orgasm moreover, it has to be “full”) – that rapturous release of endorphins and assorted chemicals – is good for you. What we need is more actual orgasms. Thus was the Age of Aquarius born, ie the Sixties, marking an end to the long, grim era of repression. Reich invented the “orgone accumulator”, which became the “orgasmatron” in Woody Allen’s Sleeper. He was eventually arrested for fraud, locked up, and died in prison in the US, aged 60, a martyr to sexual liberationBut this was only the beginning of the happiness industry, branching out into “human potential”, “self-help”, “positive thinking”, and New Age gurus, even Scientology, all of them packaged and purveyed and pharmaceutically-inflected. If you’re feeling blue, why not pop a pill? It’s your constitutional right. Especially if it might make you more productive or more “authentic”. We have ended up in a situation where no one feels they are really getting enough, of just about anything. And we are “depraved on account of being deprived” as they say in West Side Story.Cederström is the co-author, with André Spicer, of The Wellness Syndrome, and together they wrote Desperately Seeking Self-Improvement. He puts me in mind of that bloke in Boswell’s Life of Johnson who says, “I tried to be a philosopher, but cheerfulness kept breaking through.” I couldn’t resist asking Cederström if he considered himself a happy sort of guy. He said that he thought the word itself was now effectively meaningless, as per the passage from Beckett’s Waiting for Godot:Godot, Alfred Lynch plays\u0026nbspEstragon (left) and Nicol Williamson is Vladimir (Rex)Vladimir: Say you are, even if it’s not true.\u0026nbspEstragon: ​What am I to say?Vladimir: Say, I am happy.\u0026nbspEstragon: ​We are happy. (Silence.) What do we do now, now that we are happy?\u0026nbspCederström reckons that “the whole self-actualisation craze had a purpose when it kicked off, in the Sixties, as a reaction against the hyper-patriarchal image of the happy family life with the ‘happy’ housewife and all the rest”. But he clearly thinks that the concept has long outlived its usefulness and is now being sold as a contemporary form of snake oil.The thing about happiness is that it should happen to you accidentally. You can only be happy until the moment where you start asking yourself the killer question, “Am I really happy?” And then it all falls apart. Hence all the hype and hysteria and desperation around happiness is entirely self-defeating. Happiness underwent a period of massive inflation in the 20th century. Maybe we have reached the point where the bottom has fallen out of the market finally and we need to rethink happiness from the ground up.I think the Greeks had a good idea in “ataraxia”. They didn’t think of the orgasm as the be-all and end-all. The point about ataraxia is that you are neither feeling particularly good nor particularly bad, but have attained a neutral state – a kind of degree zero – in which your desires give you a break for a time. Rather than maximum gratification we are looking at the minimisation of regret.As someone suggested to me the other day, happiness equals reality minus expectations. I think stoicism is superior to mere happiness because it allows that there is and there will be suffering in the world and the best you can hope for is to be able to adjust your attitude towards it. As Epicurus says, when you drop your favourite vase and it smashes into a thousand pieces no one expects you be jumping for joy. But you might be able (with a truly heroic effort) be able to say to yourself, “The vase has been restored.”The other problem with happiness is, oddly enough, the same problem that affects surfing. It’s an essentially selfish state of being. It’s all about feeling good within yourself. It’s an internal, physiological and emotional state. Which means, in effect, that it is devoid of any morality. Harvey Weinstein was just trying to be happy too. Pursuing his democratic rights.We tend to think of other people as being or at least looking happy. And definitely happier than ourselves. The fact is they\u0026nbsparen’t, we just think they are. All those blissfully smiling beautiful people – they’re just as screwed up as everyone elseCarl Cederström sees Donald Trump as the ultimate flowering of the human potential movement. Even the president speaks of “tapping human potential”. Just as, at the same time, he speaks of “grabbing pussy” or celebrating the NRA. Happiness, as John Lennon said, “is a warm gun”. That’s my constitutional right too. Which has become practically synonymous with a lack of impulse control. I enjoy having a drink, don’t I? Or a big fat cheeseburger. So isn’t it my right to go on eating and drinking myself to death? I want to feel good, even if that way perdition lies (not to mention diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver). As the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman once said (before OD’ing on heroin), “There is no pleasure I haven’t actually made myself sick on.” Cederström himself recalls anything but fondly a week of limitless hedonistic excess in the Canary Islands, leading to an all-time hangover.Happiness, in any case, is largely an illusion. We tend to think of other people as being or at least looking happy. And definitely happier than ourselves. The fact is they aren’t, we just think they are. All those blissfully smiling beautiful people – they’re just as screwed up as everyone else. Social media only serves to spread the delusion. I once asked my son, who was supposed to be studying at university at the time, if his life was constant partying. “Why would you think that?” He asked. “Because all I see of you on Facebook is pictures of you dancing or getting drunk at parties.” He scoffed at my naivety. “That’s only because no one ever posts pictures of themselves sitting at the library and reading a book or writing an essay.”Happiness is a myth that only serves the interests of the happiness-conjurors and the manufacturers of birthday cards. I think happiness has now entered its twilight zone. I can’t see feeling good being of any intrinsic value unless it is also coupled to doing good. Aristotle had something like this in mind when he defined happiness (or eudaimonia) as leading a virtuous life. I think this is what Cederström is hoping for in the future when he speaks of “collective happiness”.But there is another issue here: just as happiness can dissolve into a kind of self-satisfaction, having one’s fellow humans in mind is only another kind of narcissism at the level of the species. One of the most ecstatic non-anthropocentric moments I can recall is when I was cycling through a park and a small bird – a sparrow, I think – came flying out of a bush straight out at me, but seeing me in the way, turned at right angles so that – for the space of a second or two – the bird was flying at exactly the height of my head and at the same speed I was cycling. With the effect that we (if I can speak of “we”, the bird and me) briefly flew along together. That was years ago and I can still feel something of what it must feel like to be a bird. It was exceptional and aleatory and probably unrepeatable. But perhaps the oceanic feeling that Freud was so sceptical of – the sense of there being “an indissoluble bond” with the universe – needs to make a comeback.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’Carl Cederström’s book, ‘The Happiness Fantasy’, is published by PolityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Since it is so massive, the satellite galaxy is quickly losing energy – meaning that it is doomed to fall into our galaxy and cause huge disruption, relatively quickly.“While two billion years is an extremely long time compared to a human lifetime, it is a very short time on cosmic timescales, said lead author Dr Marius Cautun, a postdoctoral fellow in Durham University’s Institute for Computational Cosmology.“The destruction of the Large Magellanic Cloud, as it is devoured by the Milky Way, will wreak havoc with our galaxy, waking up the black hole that lives at its centre and turning our galaxy into an ‘active galactic nucleus’ or quasar.“This phenomenon will generate powerful jets of high energy radiation emanating from just outside the black hole. While this will not affect our Solar System, there is a small chance that we might not escape unscathed from the collision between the two galaxies which could knock us out of the Milky Way and into interstellar space.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Apple expects revenue of $84 billion for the last quarter of 2018, $7 billion less than analysts expected.Mr Cook said: “We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States.”Apple’s announcement echoed the concerns that have pushed investors to flee the stock market over the last three months.

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

He confirmed he will remain in post and thinks it is important to continue working with Cabinet colleagues to ensure the best Brexit outcome for the country“If some of those MPs can be persuaded to back the prime minister’s deal, it won’t be because they’ve come under pressure to do so from their local party members over the Christmas break,” said Prof Bale.\u0026nbspThe study found that 59 per cent of Tory members opposed Ms May’s deal, compared to 38 per cent who supported it and 3 per cent who did not have an opinion.More than half, 53 per cent, also said that the deal “does not respect the result of the referendum”, comparing to 42 per cent who said that it does.People were then asked how they would vote in a referendum where there were three options – to remain, leave with the deal or leave without one – and in which they are able to put down a first and second preference.Some 57 per cent opted to leave with no deal as their first choice, with only 23 per cent putting Ms May’s deal and 15 per cent backing the option to remain in the EU.Forty per cent\u0026nbspthen put the prime minister’s proposals as their second choice, with 19 per cent putting no deal and 6\u0026nbspper cent opting to stay as a member of the bloc.The survey showed large majorities of members think both that a no-deal Brexit will have a positive impact on the economy in the medium to long term and that warnings of disruption have been exaggerated.A slim majority, 51 per cent, said they thought Ms May was doing “well”, but almost as many, 48 per cent said she was doing “badly” to some degree.But despite wavering support for Ms May and her deal, an overwhelming majority of members – 83 per cent – opposed the idea of having an election, while 82 per cent would not back a further referendum.Yesterday, the prime minister’s Northern Irish partners in government raised the stakes further in the Brexit talks, saying there is “no need” for key parts of the deal she agreed with the EU.Nigel Dodds, DUP deputy leader,\u0026nbspargued that the withdrawal agreement she is seeking “flies in the face” of the government’s own commitments relating to the border between the north and the republic.His comments came after a meeting in Downing Street, and are a blow to the prime minister as she desperately tries to convince the Northern Irish party and her own MPs to back her proposals ahead of a vote in the coming weeks.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We’ve just accomplished the most distant flyby.”Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said: “In addition to being the first to explore Pluto, today New Horizons flew by the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft and became the first to directly explore an object that holds remnants from the birth of our solar system.“This is what leadership in space exploration is all about.”The radio message from the robotic craft was picked up in Madrid by one of Nasa’s big antennas. The data took six hours and eight minutes to traverse the massive breadth of space between Ultima and Earth.According to Nasa, scientists had not discovered Ultima Thule when the probe was launched in 2006, meaning the mission was unique. In 2014, astronomers found Thule using the Hubble Space Telescope and selected it for New Horizon’s extended mission in 2015. “Anything’s possible out there in this very unknown region,” said John Spencer, deputy project scientist for New Horizons. Launched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on a 4 billion mile journey towards the solar system’s frigid edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons. The spacecraft, which is the size of a baby grand piano, flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the planet. During the flyby, the probe found Pluto to be slightly larger than previously thought. In March, it revealed that methane-rich dunes were on the icy dwarf planet’s surface.After trekking 1 billion miles beyond Pluto into the Kuiper belt, New Horizons will now seek clues about the formation of the solar system and its planets.There is a great deal scientists can learn from Ultima and the hundreds of thousands of similar bodies scientists deem to be in the solar system. Hal Weaver, project scientist on the mission, told the BBC the rock is “probably the most primitive object ever encountered by a spacecraft, the best possible relic of the early solar system”. The object is officially known as 2014 MU69, but was nicknamed Ultima Thule, a Latin phrase which means “beyond the borders of the known world”.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Getting Brits paid faster would also help stop thousands from falling into debt when they move over.The Sun has told how countless Brits have been pushed into debt waiting for the first payment to come through.Ministers are already paying  weeks of extra benefits to those claiming housing costs when they transfer, and those on ESA and JSA will get an extra payment by  too, it was confirmed in the Budget.If the payments were also extended to cover those on working tax credits at the moment, it could help  million people who claimed them in  .The DWP could also speed up the time to process payments by using the Faster Payments process for all claims - they currently use them only when payment is needed the same day.The BACS payment they currently use can take up to three days just to clear. The Resolution Foundation is also calling for single parents to get their own work allowance of at least  hours on the minimum wage.Experts calculate that raising the work allowance - the amount people on Universal Credit can earn without losing any benefits -  would help , employees.That means a single mum who was renting could get an extra £, a year - more than £ a month.They also argue that introducing a second earner work allowance of  hours on minimum wage would boost the income of a family with a child by £, a year too.It would cost £.billion to put in place, RF calculated.Laura Gardiner said:“The Chancellor’s recent decision to reinvest in Universal Credit by increasing Work Allowances will deliver a £ living standards boost to millions of families, and shows where further support should be prioritised. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000459022098.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"2019 is full of hope","story":"We have much to look forward to in the months ahead.You would scarcely believe it when listening to the Remain doom-mongers but away from the Westminster bubble, Britain is thriving.Today, Brits have never had more cash in their pockets.

The EU will be guided through its many problems by a basket-case country with a pygmy economy, most of whose citizens are desperate to get the hell out and reach the UK.Every time you might doubt we did the right thing in voting to leave, the EU comes up with another brilliant reason not to stay in.Romania, with its beleaguered government and wealth per person lower than Trinidad  Tobago and Kazakhstan. That’s who will be running the show.Right now, though, we have to get our act together. In the middle of this month there will be a debate in Parliament about Theresa May’s “new” deal for us to leave the EU.Government ministers have been whispering that May has won some concessions from the EU negotiating team. I hope so. But I kind of have my doubts.As Lord Sugar might put it, she couldn’t sell prosecco to a hen party. But it’s time to get behind her. Time, too, for arch-Brexiteers to cease being so self-indulgent and vote through a deal that is the least-worst option.Sure, I’m no fan of Theresa’s Pedigree Chum plan ­— a dog’s dinnerever there was one. Truth be told, I’d rather we crashed out with no deal at all.But that would be more dangerous — for the British economy and even for Brexit.And waiting in the wingsthe Prime Minister fails to get her plan through is Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party.Frankly, I would rather stay in the EU than have Jezza as Prime Minister. As Tom Harris, a Labour Brexiteer, put it, May’s deal gives us Leavers slightly more than half of what we voted for. And given the result of the referendum two years ago, that seems about right to me. None of us get exactly what we want.But we do leave the EU and we retain control of our borders. And soon we’ll be free to strike our own, independent, trade deals. Reach out to the rest of the world. That seems to me a decent compromise.The problem lies in convincing the arch-Brexiteer Conservative MPs that now is the time to give up the fight. I understand their many reservations. But the reality is the deal May puts before the House of Commons is about the only solution that stands a chance of winning a majority.And we are in this position largely because the Tory Brexiteers never managed to sort themselves out. At every stage, they were ided among themselves and too often concerned about their political careers.Sothis isn’t the deal we all wanted, they have themselves to blame.Our negotiations with the EU should have been done with confidence and self-discipline.Instead, we were always on the back foot because of Conservative in-fighting.Now it’s time to get serious, at long last. Becausewe don’t push this deal through, we may not get Brexit at all.MY wish for the New Year is that someone might tell me what Kendall Jenner, Rita Ora and Ferne McCann actually do for a living. Other than this kinda thing.That’s wish No. Wish No is that Gary Lineker takes a self-awareness course and discovers he’s a bumptious t***er who knows next to nowt.Most of my social-media friends went to bed at pm to avoid seeing London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s ludicrous fireworks display.And all the downstairs lights were off in the houses in my street.Are people getting bored with New Year’s Eve, do you reckon Our Foreign Secretary has just landed in Singapore to drum up more trade for Britain post Brexit.This tiny country – just a city state – is a major economic force and an important ally.It’s also a good lesson for those whining lefties who blame colonialism for the desperate plight of Africa.Singapore was founded as a British trading post exactly  years ago. It was under British control until .It has a booming economy, one of the world’s highest le expectancies and a top standard of living.So it’s not done too badly, has it The truth is colonialism is NOTHING to do with the failure of African countries. It’s about good government.Theres going to be a gay bar in EastEnders.This is an innovation dreamed up by the new script editor, Kate Oates.It’s intended to make the programme more closely represent the area in which it’s set.Ha! Here’s a tip, Ms Oates. If you want EastEnders to truly reflect the borough in which it’s set – Tower Hamlets – you need a few more sweeping changes.Fewer than a third of Tower Hamlets’ residents are white British, so that’s most of the cast gone.Almost  per cent of the people there are Bangladeshi, so the programme should be broadcast in Bengali, not English.Come on, Kate. You want EastEnders to be more real Then make it REALLY real.Lets be honest. It’s not just whichever oaf parked Paul Pogba’s car in that disabled bay who is doing it.When I go to my local supermarket, all the disabled bays are full, every time.No stickers in the car windows.And the people inside the store don’t seem to be limping very much. Sometimes I fantasise about waiting by their cars, with a hammer, for them to emerge with their shopping.“Disabled, huh  Well, you are now.”But one of the problems, I think, is that we have too many disabled bays.And so people don’t take them seriously.Quite clearly, the French are doing nothing whatsoever to deter them.It wouldn’t surprise methey were actually herding them on to the dinghies.“Go on, monsieur, you can see the clfs over there. It’s not far. Bon voyage, mon ami.”It’s another two fingers from the hopeless French because we’re leaving the European Union.What we should be doing is towing the migrants all the way back to Calais.I know living in France is probably a “cruel and unusual punishment” under United Nations laws. But it’s time the French took their responsibilities a bit more seriously.Another year dawns with something  to be terried about.Evil Chinese mussels have invaded British waters, apparently. They smother our decent, God-fearing British scallops and oysters.By the time you read this, they will probably have made their way up the Thames.It’s time we took a stand against these vile, bivalved b******s.Leave our oysters alone, you Commies!

There isn’t one.Why do the meddling zealots of Public Health England or “Action On Sugar” even get a hearing  Why aren’t they just laughed at when they suggest calorie limits on occasional restaurant mealsBecause it’s January and everyone feels guilty about Christmas scoffing. Because campaigners were emboldened by the Tories’ shameful fizzy drinks tax, even pronouncing its “success” despite zero evidence it made anyone slimmer.They smell a weakness in Downing Street for nanny-state levies and other potty measures hitting the poor hardest.The Government insists it has no plans yet for new food taxes.

These were camped in France and just decided we looked a better bet — or a softer touch.As for their apparent destitution, they managed to pay small fortunes to criminals who facilitated their sea voyage.Britain welcomes migrants who arrive legitimately. We should take our share of real asylum-seekers who do the same. But we SHOULD be “hostile” to illegals.Yes, the numbers arriving in Kent are small — so what  If they are warmly welcomed, many more will risk it and drown. Who will the Left blame then Home Secretary Sajid Javid was commendably blunt. But let’s see action.Ship them straight back to France.We MUST show them and others that the expense and risk are for nothing. This evil trafficking operation must be destroyed.IT is staggering to hear Labour champion human rights while the world’s worst abusers are the socialist regimes they adore.Frontbencher Emily Thornberry contrives offence at Jeremy Hunt talking up Singapore’s low-tax economy, because it has a poor record on free speech.Yet she and her Corbynite mates romanticise Cuba — where dissent ends in jail — and Venezuela, where the security forces murder starving citizens.The hypocrisy is sickening.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Help claimants into work and shyfinancial independence. Get help more quickly to those who need it. Less violent discourse in our politics.” Her tweet came the same day the Mirror revealed former ambulance worker Dean Lovell-Payne tried to take his own le while on the phone to the DWP after waiting a staggering  weeks for his first Universal Credit payment to arrive. Dean’s le had been changed by a fall – something that could happen to anyone.   But, cruelly, he was left thinking his le insurance would pay out more quickly than the DWP to support his we and kids. Of all the Christmases since the Tories turbocharged austerity in  – the ones with the bedroom tax, and cuts to Personal Independence Payments and Disability Living shyAllowance – this may have been the cruellest Christmas yet. The first for millions on Universal Credit. Not only were people forced to spend the festive season with empty cupboards due to the built in “five-week wait”, but Universal Credit has introduced “conditionality” – i.e. shysanctions – to millions who have never experienced it before. That’s one of the things making UC a hostile environment for claimants.   The stories of that cruelty are only just beginning, but given they will apply to more and more people,  looks set to be a story of hunger and poverty for more people. This year, despite having just been told by UN shyrapporteur Professor Philip Alston that the UK’s high child poverty rate was “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster, all rolled into one”, the Tories will use Brexit as a reason not to do anything to change the misery austerity is wreaking via welfare reform. They will say there’s no shyparliamentary time, and no political “oxygen” left. This is particularly stupid – or clever – given that how millions of people feel about Brexit is directly defined by how hopeless and worthless they feel they and their community are to the elites running the country.   Since the vote in , the Government has had two years to soften austerity, but has done nothing apart from spout some empty jam-tomorrow rhetoric about just- about-managing families. As a Remainer, Rudd might want to think hard about this. Her tweet suggests there is some kind of rocket science to making the welfare system fairer or getting help to people more quickly. The fact is Iain Duncan Smith’s reforms were conceived to make the welfare system less fair – harsher, more cruel. They were specically designed to get help to people more slowly – that’s why there’s a five- week wait. To save the welfare bill five weeks of money per person. It’s not some mysterious alchemy. It’s pretty easy to do some immediate things. Rudd’s first five quick-fix new year’s shyresolutions should be to stop the five-week wait, restore the work allowance in UC, drop sanctions across the benefit system, pause UC rollout, and reverse cuts to disabled people. All this would see foodbanks closing, not opening. Rudd is already shyremembered for one hostile shyenvironment after she was forced to resign amid the Windrush scandal. The Tories have been at it again over Christmas. Talking up the arrival of a small number of people arriving by boat to the UK the way Donald Trump talks up the “migrant caravan” in America. It creates a perception of a deluge of migrants. This is no longer Rudd’s shydepartment. But she has the chance to do shysomething about the Tories’ other most hostile environment – for shystruggling people who need the support of the welfare state. Leaver Iain Duncan Smith has helped his Brexit cause with his brutal “reforms”. The hard lives people are living were one of the key motivators for people to vote for Brexit. When you have nothing, you have nothing to lose by a radical overhaul of our contract with the world. Hostility breeds more hostility. Rudd may have done the Tory right’s dirty work at the Home Office but she’s not a wild-eyed ideologue. It may be there is too little time left now to make a dference. But opening the taps and softening austerity is the way to a softer Brexit. Meanwhile, ending austerity and giving people and communities hope for the future, attacking the causes of the first Brexit vote, is the only path to a second referendum. Perhaps that’s what Rudd’s tweet was about. Meanwhile, she did get one thing right. As we begin a new year afresh, we should all sign up to her final new year’s resolution, “less violent discourse in our politics”.

Currently Bristol City Councils planning policy does not allow the building new single-occupier homes. This is because the local authority recommends that at least two bed spaces should be made available and room for additional visitors in every new property.However, proposals for three tiny one-bed, one-person homes in the Hillfields area have recently been approved. An existing two-story Victorian building will be ided into two flats. And a new pop-up Snug home will be created in the rear garden of an existing house.At sqm to sqm, the ground-floor flat, first-floor flat and prefabricated box house all meet or exceed minimum internal floor space requirements under UK housing standards.  Each home will have its own little grassy space, and two of them will have a small patio as well. And while only one new Snug house has been approved so far, it could lead to the roll out of future homes. Planning committee members approved the new homes after developer Ecomotive urged them to “stand up and make new precedents” to help solve Bristol’s housing crisis. But council officers had recommended that councillors reject the plans, arguing that the proposed one-person homes do not provide enough room for everyday activities. An officer said: “Bristol does not accept one-bed spaces because they cannot accommodate extra residents should the need arise. “Bristol City Council expects that all new dwellings provide at least two bed spaces. “It is considered that this is the smallest unit size that can meet the flexibility and adaptability of the policies outlined, i.e., accommodate sufficient space for a partner, a child, temporary carer or visiting friends or relatives.” But Michelle Asher from Ecomotive, which is developing the Snug home design, disagreed. She said: “I’d hate to see Bristol City Council turn down a totally viable living option which addresses the need for affordable housing, small footprints, enough space for people to live comfortably and with dignity and the right to choose just based on limiting bureaucratic regulations.”  The council’s development manager, Gary Collins, advised councillors to change local planning policynecessary rather than make a habit of overruling it. Councillors backed the house conversion by nine votes to two before unanimously approving the “Snug” prefab home in the rear garden. The planning report reads: The dwelling itself is proposed to be a two storey,  bedroom,  bed space dwelling with an overall gross internal floor area of approximately sqm, ided over its two storeys. The dwelling would be .m in height and adopt a modern box   SNUG home design with a flat roof. Amenity space would be provided through a small patio areato the rear of the proposed dwelling and an area of grassachieved through the subision of the existing garden at  Forest Road. No members of the public had objected to either application and  wrote in support of the prefab home. Mr Collins added that the council is developing a new policy approach to modular units.

He claimed he built the ft by ft wooden structure as a shed and garden room to entertain family and friends. But planners have ordered him to tear it down after housing association inspectors discovered he was illegally selling alcohol on the premises. Carl, who built the secret pub in his garden in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, two years ago now has  days to demolish it or face legal further action. But the dad-of-two denies he has broken any laws and claims he uses the pub, which he called ‘The Dick Inn’, for family parties.   He said: The only things the pub has been used for are kids parties and the occasional barbecue. Ive never had any complaints and no one has ever had a problem with it before. “The beer taps are all fake. We’ve got a fridge where we keep cans of beer but I’ve never charged anyone for anything. “Bromford [Housing Association] came round after our neighbour had a fire in their shed and now Im being told I need to take it down.

Worcestershire Regulatory Services even warned Carl faced up to six months in prison for selling alcohol without a licence. A letter sent by Bromford said: Following our recent visit to your property to inspect the large building in the rear garden, it appears you have built a micro bar and it is apparent that this is not being used for personal use.   A following letter from Worcestershire Regulatory Services goes on to say that information has been provided to us that licensable activities, including the sale by retail of alcohol, are being carried on at the property, and warns that enforcement action will be takenlicensable activities continue. Jo Fieldhouse, head of locality for Bromford, said: “All customers are required to obtain written permission when planning alterations to their home and this is something which every person living in our homes agrees to as part of their tenancy agreement with us. “Unfortunately the process wasn’t followed on this occasion and, when a surveyor assessed the structure at  Teme Avenue, we found it not only conflicted with our own guidelines on what is acceptable but it was also above the size allowable without planning permission from the local authority.

Dr Gary Grfith said he was writing up notes when Mark Waterfall came in and told him: “You killed my father and I am going to kill you. Waterfall allegedly fired a crossbow bolt into the GPs stomach, leaving a gaping wound that Dr Grfith had to pull apart to see how far it had gone in, the court heard. As he did so, he said, Waterfall looked down at the floor “dejected” and said: “I can’t even get that right.” Dr Grfith was giving evidence at St Albans Crown Court where Waterfall, , is on trial after pleading not guilty to a charge of attempted murder.  The GP told jurors he was able to pull the arrow from out of his stomach wall at the surgery in Watford, Hertfordshire, adding: “Although the wound was gaping it hadn’t gone into the colon.” He said: “I had to pull the wound apart to checkit had gone into the bowel. I was still sitting down and I removed the bolt and put it on my desk. I pulled the wound apart to see how far it had gone in.” He told the jury that, despite his injuries, he followed Waterfall outside and urged him to go to a police station. It’s alleged that five days before the crossbow incident, the doctor had seen Waterfall’s father, Terrence, who was complaining of “breathlessness, at the surgery. The doctor had arranged for him to attend Watford General Hospital, where he died the following day. At the start of the case, prosecutor Martin Mulgrew told the jury how, on the morning of July  last year, Waterfall, from South Oxhey, drove to Dr Grfith’s surgery at the Suthergrey House Medical Centre in St Johns Road, Watford.  He parked his silver Hyundai car in the surgery car park before going into the building, where the doctor was working that morning. The doctor told the jury he had been based at the surgery for  years and his name was on the wall beside the door to his consultation room. At around am he said he was sitting in a swivel chair at his desk, where he was writing up a patients notes, when the door to the room suddenly opened and Waterfall walked in.

Shocking footage shows Janice Clixby, , desperately trying to get her limb free from the machine in a venue in Scunthorpe. She got her arm stuck in a hole where the bulls ear should have been. Janice was left with a large, bleeding gouge after the bull continued to spin around her, Grimsby Live reports. It happened in Schnapps Bar in the town centre, where she collapsed in agony after her horror ordeal. Janice, who had only had one drink in the bar, said that she was shouting at the man controlling the bull to stop, but said he could not hear her over the venue’s music.  She said: “My family came down from Scotland, so we went out for some food and ended up going for a few drinks in Schnapps. “I was not drunk at all. I only had one drink. Id been on the mechanical bull loads of times in the past so I decided to go on it again with my family being there. “Whilst I was on it, I grabbed what I thought would be the ear, but there was a hole and my arm got stuck in it. It was very painful, I thought I had broken it for sure. “I was in so much pain that I had to have a drip in and was given morphine amongst other painkillers.”  Janice, who works at Scunthorpe General Hospital as a support worker, spent the night in hospital and suffered severe soft tissue damage after the incident on December . The next day, she went back to the nightclub to speak to the staff. Janice said: “I told her how badly it injured me and was told that it won’t happen again. It was only until one of the bar staff later saw photos of my arm was when they apologised. “They didn’t even apologise at first. I still haven’t had an apology from the owner.”  Janice claims that she has spoken to solicitors as she had very limited use of her arm and was unable to work. Scunthorpe Live have contacted Schnapps Bar and are currently awaiting a comment.

Vincent Lamb has faced severe criticism for admitting on Good Morning Britain he didnt contact the toddlers family. His new project, Detainment, dramatises police interviews with Jamess twisted killers Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. And Mr Lamb argued he made the film to get a deeper understanding of the crime. Speaking on the ITV programme, he said: I did think about it, I thought about it a lot [contacting the Bulger family]. Then it probably wouldnt have been made. I have enormous sympathy for the Bulger family. When I think of what the Bulger family have gone through it honestly breaks my heart and my film is not meant to bring anguish to them. I think that it will be a very dficult watch for them.  I wouldnt expect them to be comfortable with a film that humanises these boys. However, his confession sparked a barrage of blasts on Twitter. One person said: I cannot believe what I am hearing and seeing here! Im absolutely outraged. Another posted: Who does this guy think he is!   He’s just openly admittedhe’d contacted Denise and she had said don’t go ahead, it probably wouldn’t have happened!   Jamess mum Denise Fergus hasnt commented on the latest drama.However, she blasted a Channel  documentary last year as disgusting. And former detective superintendent Albert Kirby, who led the hunt for the child, said Detainment lacked decency and questioned how accurate its depiction of the investigation was. I think it lacks any form of taste or decency and it has been made without any consideration of the effect on Denise, the family and also any number of other people who were involved in the sensitive issues of the investigation. I think, also, it does not give a true depiction of Mrs Venables, the former police officer said. James, two, was tortured and killed by Venables and Thompson in February . The toddler was snatched from the Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle, Merseyside, by the then -year-old killers. The vile duo became the country’s youngest murderers in  years.

Emma Bullin, , was travelling at mph on the M when her eyes suddenly fuzzed over. Doctors initially told Emma, from Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, the partial loss of sight was pregnancy related, before her daughter Paige was born eight weeks later. But when Emmas eyesight failed to improve, tests revealed an enormous benign tumour at the base of her brain. It had been there for  years - but had grown to the size of a grapefruit due to a surge in pregnancy hormones. Emma believes that Paige actually saved her le by being born a month early - allowing doctors to find the tumour before it was too late. Emma, from Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, never regained her sight - so has never seen her daughter.  If she had been born full term I would not have lived, she said. I would not have had the surgery I needed to survive. It was growing at such a rate it would have killed me before they got to it. She saved my le because she helped find the tumour by coming early. We have a really close bond because we were both getting to grips with things at the same time. I was learning to get around at the same time as she was, as a baby. It was horrible of course - I have never seen her. On the positive side, I say to her that shes the most stunning girl, and she always will be. Emma was following her husband Peter, , in her Nissan Micra on the M in September , when she went totally blind in her right eye, and lost nearly all her vision in her left.  She slowed down and pulled into the hard shoulder, and her husband pulled in too. Suddenly everything went fuzzy and I realised I couldnt see anything, she said. It wasnt complete blackness - it was fuzzy. It was like when you first wake up in the morning and everything is fuzzy and you cant see, before you rub your eyes. It was like a fog right in front of me. I couldnt see anything clearly. Thankfully it was an automatic car and I pulled the car over and stopped on the hard shoulder. It was absolutely terrying. There were so many thoughts going through my head. I was thinking whats wrong with me  Whats wrong with my baby  Will it stay like this  It was the last time I saw clearly. They drove to an optician who said he could see something behind your eye but said it was likely due to her pregnancy. A week later she had a midwe appointment where she was told these things happen all the time when women are pregnant.  She recalled: I thought it was odd. I had never heard of pregnant women going blind, but you just take their word for it. Her daughter, now , was in breech position and Emma was hospitalised with pre-eclampsia and bells palsy. She still couldnt see, but said medics didnt want to do an MRI scan to investigate further, before the baby was born. That night she listened to me, said Emma. I looked at my bump and said mummys really poorly now andyou come now you will be absolutely fine, but mummy is quite poorly and needs you out so I can get some help. The next day at am I went into natural labour. Paige was born on October , , a month early, weighing lb oz, and contrary to earlier predictions, Emmas sight didnt come back.  An MRI scan revealed she had lesions on the brain. She said: We werent experts so I thought lesion meant cut. I was thinking to myself how have I cut my brain  It was only when my mum walked past the midwes office and heard them talking about the poor girl with the brain tumour that she realised it was me. I had the tumour before and when I was pregnant it was like woopee because of the oestrogen and grew loads. She had a crainiotomy to give her brain room to swell, and the tumour was removed, but she was kept in a coma for several days.  My mum brought up my daughter for those first few months, as my husband had to go back to work, said Emma, who was able to go home around three months later, on Christmas Eve. She would bring her in and lay her on my chest and it was the time when my daughter would sleep most soundly. I had to get used to this new le - both as a mother and as a blind person. Emma began a degree in English Literature a month later and had radiotherapy to shrink a second inoperable tumour, before also completing a PGCE and is now studying for her masters. She said she has struggled to find full time work due to her disability, despite applying for hundreds of jobs over the years, and she dreams of become a teacher. But she reckons being blind has made her a better mum. She said: I suppose you could say because of it I became a bit obsessive. I was so worried that someone would think I was going to be a bad mum.  I never had a brand new baby. When she was new my mum was looking after her and by the time I got home, she was already holding her head up on her own. She never once had cradle cap or nappy rash, because I was so obsessed with getting things right. She was % my priority and always will be. I know thats the same for most mums. In a way being blind made me a better mum, and better in the day to day taking care of a new born, because I was so obsessed with not being accused of getting it wrong. I never wanted to tumour to define me and I knew I wanted to be a good mum.

The government is advising families with dferent surnames to take supporting documentation to airports with them in order to prove they are related. Earlier this year the Home Office shared an image on Twitter urging parents to take birth or adoption certicates on holiday with them in order to speed up the passport control process. They added: Families with dferent surnames may be asked questions to establish their relationship. The tweet was met with a great deal of indignation from parents on the social  and Labour MP Stella Creasy compared the UK to Gilead - a fictional patriarchal dystopia in novel The Handmaids Tale. One Twitter user responded: I am fundamentally against this. My husband and I have dferent surnames. And our son bears my husbands. Not unusual for parents to have dferent surnames in the st Century. Appalling stuff by @sajidjavid and the Home Office. Another wrote: Just to clary women who chose not to take their husbands surname or have children with a partner they are not married to will be subject to increased border measures. This is what freedom looks like under a Tory government  Straight out of Gilead.  Why might families with dferent surnames be questioned at airports  After sharing the original message the Home Office added a follow-up tweet to explain why the procedure is so important, writing: We have a duty to safeguard children and to prevent people trafficking, child sexual exploitation and other crimes. That is why Border Force officers sometimes need to ask additional questions. On the governments website the situation is explained further: Every day thousands of children arrive at the UK border, manyfrom holiday with their family or with family friends. The safety and welfare of every child is of utmost importance to us and sometimes we may ask a few questionsan adult is not the child’s parent, or has a dferent family name. For more information on Border Forces policy, there is a leaflet parents can access on the governments website.  Advice for families travelling with dferent surnames The government advises that,you are travelling with children who have a dferent surname, you may be asked questions at the border to prove your relationship. You can help by bringing with you the following documents:a birth or adoption certicate showing your relationship with the child orce or marriage certicatesyou’re the parent but have a dferent surname from the child a letter from the child’s parent or social worker giving permission for the child to travel with youLast year, a lawyer warned mums and dads they could unknowingly end up embroiled in a child abduction case, be refused past check-in, or turned away at border controlthey fail to take the right documents with them, the Manchester Evening News reported. One of those was Wigan mum Hannah Marshall, who was stopped with her daughter Lilly at London Stansted Airport when they ed from a holiday in Denmark. At the time Hannah, , wasnt married to Lillys dad Scott, so while Lilly had the surname Marshall, Hannahs was still Thomas.  Hannah said While queuing I went to one desk with my daughter and my partner and his mum went to another desk for passport control. They looked at both mine and my daughters passports then asked me how I knew the little girl and when I said it was my daughter they asked why I did not have the same last name. They asked my daughter who I was to her and thats when my partner came over and explained that shes his daughter too and as we werent married she had his last name.  They told us that my partner should have taken her through passport control because I would need to prove she was my daughter. They checked my partners passport to prove she held the same last name and then let us through. It can, however, be dficult for a person to prove they are a childs parent on the spot, unless they are carrying the right documents. David Connor heads up the family department at Woodcocks Haworth and Nuttall Solicitors, who have offices in Bury and Lancashire and says parents need to plan ahead to avoid being caught out. He said: People need to take extra caution when holidaying with children who don’t share their surname as they could unknowingly end up embroiled in a child abduction case, be refused past check-in, or turned away at border control. It’s vital you have the correct documentation to hand or it could derail your trip. For separated families, you’ll need evidence of approval from your child’s other parent, but remember to seek approval from everyone with parental responsibility – this may include grandparents too. He added: You’ll also need a copy of any Child Arrangement Order which proves you have court approval to take the child abroad. It’s vital that all evidence marries up and this is where orced parents are often caught out, particularly women who revert back to their maiden name. A change of name deed will help here, which can be supplied by a solicitor. Take a copy of your child’s birth certicate with you too to prove who you are. You wont need permission from an absent parenttheyre not on the childs birth certicate, butan absent parent has passed away you may be required to take the death certicate with you. If an absent parent doesnt consent to you taking the child out of the country you will need to go to court to try and resolve the matter.

Others reportedly left The Birches Head in tears while some were left waiting hours to be served their first course. Around  people were booked into the pub in Sneyd Green, Stoke-on-Trent, for a pound three-course meal on December . But pub manager Annette Townley - who was also responsible for cooking the food - was unable to cope with the demand and says a combination of overbooking by the previous tenants and latecomers turned Christmas Day into a disaster. Stoke Sentinel reports how angry guests called the experience a complete shambles. Kathryn Fairbanks, , was part of a group of  family members expecting to dine that day. They arrived early for their .pm booking - and by pm no members of staff had approached their table. Did you have a disastrous Christmas Day lunch  Contact webnews@trinitymirror   She said: We could hear other tables saying that they were waiting to be served, one had been booked in at pm and had only had their starter, and it was pm. My sister-in-law went to see what was happening and we were told it would be at least pm before we would be served. There was only one waitress working, and she said it was her first day. It was a complete shambles. Kathryn’s family and several guests ended up leaving without being fed. Their pound deposits have been refunded. The mum added: Luckily I had a small turkey breast at home which I was going to cook on Boxing Day, so we had turkey baps – I didn’t have any veg in. We had one relative in his s and another in her s. Not only did we have no Christmas dinner but it was supposed to be a time of getting together as a family, making memories. Unfortunately time is not something you can get back. It was the first time we had been out somewhere for Christmas dinner and well never do it again.  Kathryn’s sister-in-law Janette Shankland, , said: It was a complete nightmare. We ended up having beans on toast when we got home. I was so upset because I wanted it to be nice for my elderly father-in-law and auntie. They both live on their own and they were really looking forward to it. They must have known they were going to struggle to serve the people who were booked in. Why didn’t they phone us beforehand, so we could have arranged something   Others took to TripAdvisor to share their dismay. One reviewer called it abysmal and said: We booked Christmas Day lunch for pm. Arrived at .pm to find the restaurant full but no food to be seen. When questioned the seated diners said they had been waiting for two hours. As we only live five minutes away we ed home. I was in tears as the day was ruined, we ended up with a pizza. Annette, who took over the Innkeepers Lodge venue in October, said: There were  people booked in. I thought, in October people wouldn’t be able to book anywhere , so I thought I would just try to do it. I did try to phone some people but the numbers in the book weren’t right. On Christmas Day we were ready to go at midday, but the first two parties were late. The knock-on effect of that was phenomenal. I was trying my hardest to catch up. There was nothing I could do.  Asked why the situation was not explained to diners, she said: I did come out to apologise. My waitress did tell people. I spoke to who I could on the day but I just had to keep going. It was absolutely horrible. Ive been doing this for  years and I’ve never had a day like that. Boxing Day and New Year’s Eve went really well – they were bookings I had taken. Christmas Day was a one-off. I can’t apologise enough to people. A spokesman for Innkeepers Lodge said: This was not done with any malice or bad intent. Annette has a good heart and over-estimated her ability to fulfil the bookings. We are very sorry for the disappointment caused to customers.

A road sign in Somerset that once read Yeovil and Tintinhull now reads nowhere and somewhere. Resident Julie Woan told Somerset Live locals were getting annoyed that drivers were speeding along roads in their village. So they decided to change the signs to try and deter them from going along there. She says the issue of cars speeding along this lane arose because motorists want to avoid the ridiculous roundabout at the other end of Bluebell Road. To dodge the  sets of traffic lights along Bluebell Road, Mrs Woan says drivers are taking a more scenic route. This involves going along the narrow Lufton Lane at high speed - essentially using it as a rat run to get to Yeovil.  The sign is hilarious. I assume it has been done by fed-up villagers who are now seeing more and more drivers speed along this narrow lane, she said. I wonderanyone has got lost as a result of the tweaked signs. There are new houses that swallow up the lane to Lufton near a new school just after Houndstone corner. The ridiculous roundabout with  sets of lights is at the other end of Bluebell Road. Before it worked fine as a roundabout. There were no accidents in  years of using the roundabout daily before the lights came in a few months ago. But now the queues are worse and myself and my daughter have witnessed three accidents and numerous near misses along there. The traffic lights are confusing to a lot of people.  This photo, and many others like it, has been shared on social media. But Mrs Woan says the problem is not going away any time soon. There have been ongoing roadworks on the Yeovil western corridor for a very long time , she said. However the roundabouts along this stretch are being replaced with loads and loads of traffic lights, the roundabout at the end of Bluebell Road has seen no improvement with traffic flow since traffic lights were installed. It is too small for the flow of traffic at rush hour and halts traffic at night without any traffic. Something needs to be done to fix these problems.

Becky Marshall has hit out after becoming absolutely sick of faeces along her road, because lazy dog owners are not picking it up. Mum-of-two Mrs Marshall, from Hull, says her babys pram also ends up being covered in it, and called for action. The -year-old said it took more than an hour to clean her home after her oldest son ran through the house with shoes covered in dog waste.The pram, which she uses to stroll her three-month-old baby, was also left covered in animal excrement, Hull Live reports. Have you been affected by this issue  Email webnews@mirror    Mrs Marshall said: “It has always been an issue down here but I think recently I am noticing it more. I have a baby and a young son so when I’m pushing the pram ahead of me I can’t look down. “My little boy runs around it and even when I go for a run there’s tons of it down the path. I know we get a lot of foxes around here so it could possibly be that. “I’m not too sure what that looks like but there are a lot of dog walkers around here too and I can’t think of any other reason why there is so much mess. I just don’t understand why people do it.”   Mrs Marshall has noticed that a lot of the mess plaguing Windsor Road is “sloppy” and she has suggested this may be why dog walkers are reluctant to pick up after their pups. However, she wants dog walkers down her street to be more respectful and mindful of residents who are having to traipse through it all just to get from A to B. “This is where we live and it’s a really nice street but this is just letting it down,” Mrs Marshall said. “It’s a family area with young children running around and I am having to clean my little boy’s shoes and hosepipe my pram after every walk, which isn’t great. “He ran through the house and I had to clean the whole house which took more than an hour and I haven’t even got a dog.“I put a post on Facebook and people have agreed me with people from nearby streets saying that they’re noticing the same mess and how it is an issue in their area.“There is only one bin which is in the middle of the street down the tenfoot but they should be picking it up anyway. They need to think about their actions and the consequences they are having on others. “Every time they walk away and leave their mess we are left to deal with it and young children are walking through it.” Under current laws, anyone who fails to clear up after their dog can be fined up to pound. Dog owners cannot say in defence they were unaware their dog had fouled or that they did not have a suitable bag to pick up its mess.A spokeswoman for Hull City Council said: “We expect dog owners to be responsible and pick up after their dogs. There is a bin on the corner of Windsor Road and County Road North which can be used by people picking up their dog’s mess.”"},{"url":null,"title":"airline staff find womans plan","story":"NewsAirline staff find womans plan to confess love to best friend on sick bagA woman who was \"bored\" on her flight wrote down her plan to tell her best friend shes in love with him when she landsShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsSick bags arent particularly romantic \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A woman who was nervous about confessing her love to her best friend, wrote her plan to reveal her feelings on an aeroplane sick bag.While flying from Miami to Washington D.C, the woman identied only as Andrea used the sick bag as a way to vent her feelings.

His images reveal that there are Bandersnatch posters in the windows, with comic books relating to episode such as San Junipero and USS Callister. Games consoles in the shop also feature the logo for Tuckersoft - the company Stefan Butler is developing a choose your own adventure video game for in the film.  Despite the buzz surrounding the stores, it seems they arent actually open to the public and can only be viewed from the outside.

Pabuk approached southern Thailand yesterday with winds of up to mph - with one person being confirmed dead today. The victim is understood to have been part of six crew members on a fishing boat, with another missing and four confirmed safe. Airlines and ferry services have been cancelled, leaving many Brits with no choice but to find safe shelter from the approaching storm. Many have been told to bolt their rooms shut and stay inside as the winds, waves and torrential rains grow more intense by the hour. The British Foreign Office has this morning issued a warning against Brits travelling to Thailand. Jo Slade, , and her husband Des are stranded on Koh Samui and said the weather was horric. Have you been affected by the storm  Contact webnews@trinitymirror  The mum-of-four said: The weather is horric and all flights today are cancelled. Many people here are stranded. We are due to begin our journey back to UK tomorrow. Fingers crossed it all calms down.  Our complex Centara Villas is right in the beach. We are watching huge waves crashing down and everyone at the hotel is nervous and eager to get back to their UK homes. We can’t believe this time yesterday we were sunbathing on the beach. The noise of the wind is very scary. We’ve been told to stay in our rooms  stay safe. The rain is torrential. While winds are currently recorded at around mph, the Met Office said the sustained gales and vastness of the storm make them strong enough to bring down trees and power lines as well as damage buildings. The heavy rainfall also poses a danger to le with risk of flash flooding, sea surges and landslides.  Mark Robson is also stranded on Ko Yao Noi with his family and said unfortunately, the next few days, we fear the worst. He said they are unable to leave, despite the calm before the storm and have no idea when they will be able tohome. Mark said: Unfortunately the next few days we fear the worst. We cannot leave now when it is calm. No boat can take us. A government ban on all boats in the whole of southern Thailand leaving port means we are here all of today. Tomorrow the storm will be nearer us and the weather will be worse and the likelihood of boats leaving presumably nil. By the time the storm is scheduled to be above us on this tiny little island on Sunday we will be at the mercy of it. We just have to wait. Who knows when we will be able to leave. What will happen here we dont know.

But with New Years Day been and gone, and most of us back at work or school, the sagging branches are looking a bit sad and rooms are feeling just a bit too crammed full. Theres probably more pine needles on the floor than on the lower boughs, and that traditional Christmas tree smell has all but faded. You may have already taken them down, but the tradition, since the Victorian era, is to remove decorations on Twelfth Night. Every year this very tradition causes confusion, as people are left scratching their heads wondering when the date falls and why. Heres the answers and the date when you should take down your decorations. When is Twelfth Night   Depending on what youre celebrating its either January  or January  - and the last day you should keep festive decorations up. A day sooner or later is considered unlucky anddecorations are not removed on Twelfth Night then according to tradition they should stay up all year. Until the th century though, people would keep their decorations up until Candlemas Day on February . Twelfth Night falls on January  and Epiphany on January . Twelfth Night is so called because traditionally Christmas was a  day celebration, beginning on December . This can create some confusion as some will class January  as Twelfth Night because it is the th day after Christmas. Epiphany marks the end of Christmas when the Three Kings came to visit bearing gts, guided by the star which is now represented in the twinkling lights adorning our homes. Why is it unlucky   January  is observed as the last day of Christmas festivities - the eve of the Epiphany. In the past it was believed that tree-spirits lived in the greenery – such as holly and ivy – that people used to decorate their homes. While the festive season provided shelter for these spirits during the winter, they needed to be released outside once Christmas was over. If this custom wasn’t followed, greenery would notand vegetation would not grow as a result, causing agricultural and then food problems. Even though Christmas decorations are now less about foliage and more about baubles, glitter, tinsel and singing Santas, many people still adhere to the superstition. Do all countries follow this tradition   No. Because there is disagreement as to whether January  or January  is actually Twelfth Night lots of countries end up taking down their festooned trees at dferent times. This can also depend on when people actually celebrate the festive season - for example in Russia Christmas Day falls on January . But January  is officially the day of the Epiphany. This is from the Christian tradition where the faithful mark the birth of Jesus on December . The Maji didnt arrive until much later with their gtsso Christians mark this on January . Children were traditionally told thatyou took down your decorations before the Eve of the Epiphany, the wise men might not be able to find their way - because Christmas lights represent the Star of Bethlehem which guided them to Jesus. A number of countries in Europe follow the January  tradition, including the Germans, Poles and Czechs. However for some people, simply having the decorations up into the New Year is too much and many will be taking them down on the st of January.  Real Christmas trees will be accepted at most household tips, but local authorities, garden centres and community groups may accept them for recycling. Find out where might be suitable for this in your area.  If your decorations aren’t going into a loft or attic, make sure they’re stored in a watertight, plastic box - in fact, doing this wherever they are kept will protect them from damp and pests. It’s also worth wrapping fragile Christmas ornaments in tissue paper before storage - and, of course, coiling the lights in a neat circle round your arm. Obviously the loft fairies will have tangled them into a mess by next December, but at least you can say you tried when you open them in a frazzled temper next time.  The UK is estimated to use almost , tonnes of card packaging at Christmas, enough to make a cardboard motorway stretching from Birmingham to Lapland and back  times. Recycle Now is urging consumers to recycle this material rather than bin it. Shiny and metallic ieties of wrapping paper are not recyclable, so the campaign advises people to use the ‘scrunch test’ to check. If you scrunch the paper in your hand and it stays in a ball then it can by recycled but it can’tthe paper springs back. If youre recycling bin is full, several shops such as Marks and Spencer run card recycling schemes to raise funds for charity.

We controlled the game and had chances to score the second.“We didn’t and then we concede two goals and that is not good. If we want to be top of this league we cannot repeat this mistake.”Painful as the unexpected defeat was, he believes what’s vital now is United put the disappointment of what was only a second defeat since Neilson took charge in October, behind them as quickly as possible.And with home games against Partick Thistle and Dunfermline coming up over the next two Saturdays, he wants the focus to be on what lies ahead and not what’s just gone.“We now just have to think about the next game. We have two games coming now at home and we must think about that and make sure we win them.“Alloa was a very big disappointment but there is still half of the season for us to play and we must put things right. We must keep going and be strong for the rest of the season.“We have been good in most home games and we must make sure that continues.”Since his arrival near the end of the summer transfer window on a two-year contract at Tannadice, Bouhenna has impressed as a hard-tackling centre-half who can also play when he is moving forward with the ball at his feet.Saturday past, however, saw him moved into a midfield holding role and despite the result, put in an impressive performance.For him that change of role was about doing what was needed for the team.“I have played before some games in the midfield. Fraser Fyvie was injured and I will play there because you must always do what is needed for the team.“It was not a surprise because when I came here I played some games in midfield and when the manager asked me to play there I was happy to do it for the team.“I have played some games there during my career. Centre-back is my best position, of course, but I knew I could help the team there and I did it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"at least 10 cops line dundee street after disturbance at home","story":"Police officers were called to Mains Road in Dundee following a disturbance at a house.A witness said the street was “lined” with police cars near to its junction with Dens Road at around am on Wednesday.Officers were seen running towards a close before carrying bags out of the property.A number of residents in the block said they were aware of the police presence but were unsure what had happened.

Bringing in the right people who have been there and done it, have got the drive to take the ball and make something happen and can make the flash that gets us back into the game will make us a lot stronger.”Woods has made a real impact on the side since penning a short-term contract that expired after the weekend loss.Even in that defeat, the former Partick man drew the only positive shout from the crowd as he squared up to a couple of St Johnstone men with the yell ‘at least he’s showing a bit of fight’ coming from the home support.“I would agree with that,” Woods said.“That was out of pure frustration. The crowd in the main have been absolutely brilliant and that’s just not me trying to be the good guy and get everybody up.“I think they’ve been really good for the position the club is in.“They just want people battling, people at it, giving their lot – that’s the least you should be giving. I think those will be the types the manager is after in January, giving what he is like as a guy and what he demands of people.“He’ll want people to go and give their lot, it might not be perfect every week, but they’ll give their full lot and they’ll have some guts.”Though he’s not signed yet till the end of the season, Woods says he’s keen to stay on.He added: “We spoke after the game and that’s ongoing just now, we’ll see what happens.“I’ve loved my time here, the fans have been great with me, the boys have been great, too, getting me right in the mix straight away.“The manager has been really good, I know what I’m getting from him but I think he needs a bit of help so, hopefully, he gets that this month and gets a few boys in who are up for the challenge.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0519f564571.jpg ","title":"brexit dundee shops and cafes to stay open later to mark eu departure","story":"A one-off night of late openings for cafes and traders in the city centre will take place on March .The evening of late trading has been co-ordinated by city development convener Lynne Short after claims by City Centre and Harbour Community Council that Dundee’s early evening nightle was non-existent.Ms Short’s choice of date for the “European-style” hours is deliberate, since it is the last day the UK is officially part of the European Union.She said: “The businesses are keen and the council is aiming to work with others to add things to do.“The community council has endorsed it too – it is keen to build links with the business community and sees it as a great opportunity to help each other out.“Why shouldn’t Dundee show its European credentials  We voted to stay and we have a massive European history and population.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c2dfec1f32d7.jpg ","title":"closed dundee pub could be given new lease of life by heineken firm","story":"Fresh plans have been unveiled to give a new lease of le to a once-popular city pub.Star Pubs and Bars, which owns The Mercantile in the city centre, said the firm is confident the venue will be taken over this year.The company, a subsidiary of brewing giants Heineken, said talks are ongoing with interested parties hoping to take on the Commercial Street boozer.The Mercantile closed in August  for a makeover with the intention of reopening once it was complete, however, the doors remained shut and the search is still on for a licensee.The Tele previously revealed that Heineken was prepared to inject £, into The Mercantilea licensee came forward.But the plans have now been revised in a bid for the pub to host live entertainment.New designs released on the company’s website highlight a more spacious interior which would include a DJ booth, a stage and a privatearea, with the pub simply renamed “Smith’s”.The previous plan was for a “modern industrial bar” named A.

Mackay-Steven was knocked unconscious in a sickening clash of heads with Dedryck Boyata.Having suffered concussion, Mackay-Steven has been sidelined since, and McLennan started all eight Premiership games packed into December.The Redsof six wins from that run elevated them from the bottom six in the Premiership to within just three points of leaders Celtic and Rangers.For the teenage star it is a position a club of Aberdeen’s stature, having finished league runners-up for the last four seasons, expect to occupy.Mackay-Steven is expected toto action after the winter break but McLennan’s emergence has certainly given McInnes selection options.And McLennan, who has netted twice this season, is ready and willing to start again for the Donsrequired.He said: “The manager has shown faith in me to keep me in the team and hopefully I have repaid him.“I have played since the cup final which has been great for me personally and hopefully I can kick on in the New Year as well.“The manager knows what he is going to get from me and I will do all I can to make sure I am doing the job out on the pitch.“There are some brilliant wingers at the club and it was just about taking that chance when it came.“I was confident enough thatI did get a chance I could go on a wee run.“I think I have done that and we have got some good results in December.”Aberdeen went into the Premiership shut-down just three points behind leaders Celtic and Rangers, with Kilmarnock third.Prior to the League Cup final at the start of December, the Dons had suffered a stuttering start to the league campaign and were languishing in the bottom half of the table.Now, as they ready to jet out for a warm weather training camp on Tuesday, the Reds are in the mix of the most competitive title race for almost a decade.McLennan said: “We have climbed the table in December and racked up the points so hopefully we can push on now in the second half of the season.“For a big club like Aberdeen, up there near the top of the table is where we expect to be.“A club like us needs to be near the top of the table and we will fight to stay there for as long as we can.”Following the injury to Mackay-Steven, Pittodrie youth graduate McLennan was thrown into the deep end – straight into a cup final against double treble winners Celtic and then a trip to Rangers just three days later.Aberdeen rallied from the cup final loss to triumph - at Ibrox with McLennan playing a pivotal role in the victory.Just days after that Old Firm double-header, Aberdeen tied the Peterhead-born talent to an extended contract until summer .McLennan said: “I played through most of December which has been incredible for me.“I want to play in every game, just as every player does.”Having been at Pittodrie since the age of eight, McLennan made his first team debut at  in a - loss to St Johnstone in April . He had to wait more than two years, and via a loan spell at Brechin City, for his first start.That came in the - League Cup defeat of St Mirren in October, where he also scored a spectacular goal.He finished a break-through year with an eighth straight start in the - victory at Livingston.He said: “Livingston had a few good results against some of the good teams in the league so we knew what we would be in for.“We had a game plan and managed to carry that out to get the win we wanted.“When we got the first goal we were comfortably of pushing on and getting another goal.“Even when Livingston scored we were confident enough we could pull through for the win.”"},{"url":null,"title":"council approves helicopter firms 1m aberdeen office revamp","story":"A helicopter company’s almost £ million plans to revamp its Aberdeen offices have been given the green light.CHC Helicopter Services applied to Aberdeen City Council to improve its offices in Dyce in August last year.A building warrant published by the local authority shows that the work could amount to as much as £,.According to the warrant, the Canadian-based firm is looking to mody its existing offices at the terminal on Buchan Road, which will include the extension of the passenger lounge, the building of a new entrance and the revamp of some of the building’s facades.Permission was given for the work yesterday, after setting the initial deadline of September for the decision to be handed down.The company, based in British Columbia, offers search-and-rescue support in the North Sea, as well as offshore transportation across six continents – with more than  flights departing from Dyce each day taking staff to oil s."},{"url":null,"title":"customers refunded after mix up","story":"EasyJet have refunded or re-booked dozens of passengers after a customer service mix up following their decision to axe an Aberdeen flight.The Evening Express previously revealed easyJet was axing its route between Aberdeen International Airportand London Gatwick.Almost  people posted social media messages in response to the article, criticising the budget airline for the decision.Some challenged its explanation there had been a “reduction in demand” by claiming the flight was full most days.EasyJet axes Aberdeen flights but forgets about refunds\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news local airline-axes-route-but-forgets-about-refunds embed # secretSFhzG\" data-secret\"SFhzG\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#EasyJet axes Aberdeen flights but forgets about refunds# # Evening Express\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Around  of those said they had booked with easyJet to fly on the route after February  – the last day of service.Many said that, when they contacted easyJet customer services for help, staff members claimed they had no information about the route being cancelled.However, easyJet now says the issue has been resolved and everyone booked to fly after February  has been given a refund or put on another route.In an online exchange seen by the Evening Express, Aberdeen woman Elise Clark asks for a refund and is told by an easyJet customer service operator: “We don’t have any information regarding these flights.”Mrs Clark described the response as “unbelievable”.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"woman admits acting intimidating manner","story":"NewsWoman admits to acting in intimidating mannerThe -year-old shouted, swore and acted in an aggressive and intimidating way towards Shannon Kerr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has admitted to acting in an intimidating manner.

For Deborah Biggar has just got a whole chunk smaller. The -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier. Deborah, of Dalmellington, revealed a Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis meant she was put on steroids at age just . Even after the first round of steroids she put on two stone. And she said: “I realised I had to do something or my weight would soon be out of control.” She’d kept active as a community support officer and loved horse riding - but had to get out the saddle as her mobility reduced.   Deborah said: “Riding was something I absolutely loved, and also walking, and with this loss of regular activity, I was definitely going to be up against keeping the weight off.” She took the plunge and joined the Coylton branch of WW . She revealed: “I turned up alone and felt very apprehensive. “Due to my illness this wasn’t an easy thing for me to do, as I can be very self-conscious and don’t often go many places on my own, but I needn’t have worried.” Class wellness coach Kellie Brown and her team quickly put Deborah at ease, and she has now only missed one workshop since joining.   During her battle her weight has snowballed up and down as her medications changed. She said: “I am delighted with my weight loss so far as I am feeling much better, not just physically, but I think more importantly, mentally I am in a better place. Going out I do not feel as self-conscious and my confidence is now a lot better. “I went to my nephew’s wedding a happier and much more confident and content person, and looked forward to it, instead of dreading going. “This is all thanks to Kellie and the group I attend at Coylton and this time I will be continuing to attend workshops to help keep me on track.” She tracks calories with an online WW app as she trawls supermarket aisles.   Deborah said: “I love the fact there are so many zero smartpoint foods, and I eat out quite regularly. As long as I track everything and make sensible decisions, I can still lose weight no problem. I sometimes choose what I’m having before I go with the help of my app. I don’t have a sweet tooth so saying no to desserts and cakes is an easy decision for me.” Fatty foods like chips and fried meals have been swapped for fruit, veg, chicken and home-made soup. Trips out are now anxiety free. She revealed: “I am no longer thinking that people are thinking she is only using a stick or scooter because she is fat but they actually see I have a disability. “With my weight loss I am on the list for the Riding for the Disabled Association, and my fingers are crossed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"make-a-date-with-sinatra-and-crosby-this-christmas-in-selkirk","story":"THERES a chance to swing your way into Christmas this weekend in Selkirk with some of the best-known festive hits.Christmas Crooners is coming to Victoria Halls on Sunday as part of their UK tour, now in its tenth record-breaking year.The show features the renowned West-End Singers performing the famous Christmas hits of all the greats, including Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Nat King Cole.They will be showcasing over  of the best-loved festive tunes, such as lsquoDeck the Hallsrsquo, lsquoChestnuts Roastingrsquo and lsquoSanta Babyrsquo, bringing some old-school Christmas glamour to the Borders.Stephen Leatherland, producer and director of the show, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted to be bringing Christmas Crooners to Selkirk and the Border region.\"This fantastic show has brought joy to many people over the last ten years and more, and we look forward to bringing a parcel of Christmas Magic to Selkirk ndash the perfect start to the festive season for young and old alike.Staged in the warm style of the famous Andy Williams Christmas Shows, this production comes complete with Christmas trees, a rocking chair and fireplace.Christmas Crooners is a community-minded event that will bring people together in the local town hall over the Christmas period to celebrate all things festive, with top-quality musicians performing Christmas classics.Hamish Moir, events and programming officer for Live Borders, said: ldquoI canrsquot think of a better way to celebrate the festive season than by heading to the local town hall for an evening of recreating the biggest Christmas hits.\"The Christmas Crooners put on a top quality performance with the West-End singers and Jazz-All-Stars, and we canrsquot wait for them to come to Selkirk for a cosy evening of live music.ldquoWe have a great series of events running over Christmas and in  that would make great gts, and I recommend looking at our website to view the full programme.\"At Live Borders we want to help make communities healthier, happier and stronger, especially at Christmas time, so come and join us on December  for these feel-good hits.Christmas Crooners will be performing in Victoria Halls, Selkirk, on Sunday at :.Tickets, priced at pound., are still available from www.eventbrite or by calling  ."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering.

We have strong institutions and professions. We have lots of natural strengths. But they will be eroded at a pace that will scare uswe are not awake to this threat.Mr Murray said there were no longer any ldquountouchables in Scotland but warned that there was a danger of a long-term ldquodrag on the nationrsquos economygangster infiltration was not stopped.The investigator said the profits of Scotlandrsquos multi-billion drugs industry were not increasingly being laundered at home, in the new corporate equivalent of traditional cash ldquosafe houses.The old safe houses were properties where bulk cash could be stored before being laundered abroad.Mr Murray explained: ldquoCompanies are now being acquired to take the place of safe houses.ldquoThere is always a reason for cash to be in companies. The companies themselves may have an entirely legitimate business but it provides an effective shelter for these funds which are then drawn in through a network of associated companies. This can then provide a story of value or a source of income for organised crime players.ldquoYou could always tell the sort of companies associated with organised crime. Taxi, security and logistics firms, tanning salon and nail bars.ldquoWe are beginning to move away from that now. What we are seeing is that for the serious players in organised crime and looking to acquire business with a good track record, training and good reputation in marketplace.ldquoThe typical scenario is they identity a company which has all of these characteristics but for whatever reason has run in to cash flow dficulties.ldquoIn general, the central belt of Scotland has always been resilient to outside influences. Increasingly the senior players in Scottish organised are engaging with international service providers.One of those foreign iniduals has himself acquired a business in exactly the way I have described.ldquoI think that could be as a result of wishing to de-risk from being directly involved in the physical carriage of drugs.Scotland has increasingly become known overseas as the new Switzerland - with its shell companies offering the same kind of opportunities to hide illicit cash as Swiss bank accounts once did.Mr Murray, however, is not talking about shell companies, such as Scottish limited partnerships, which tend to bank overseas. He is talking about the purchase by gangsters of real-world business which employ real people and do real business in Scotland.And he believes the consequences for failing to deal with this criminalisation could be grave. Mr Murray said: ldquoThe fundamental penalty for allowing an accumulation of criminal cash in the economy is that it is a drag on the economy. It undermines competitiveness, it discourages legitimate players from entering those markets. If it becomes a growing theme in Scotland, it is bound to affect inward investment.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"Today   s feminist activists are wrong to exclude men","story":"Anne Widdicombe might have dismissed it as trivial and whingeing ndash and some #MeTooers undoubtedly deserve that label ndash but the culture of sexual harassment and abuse it calls out is far from unimportant. Equally crucial are other issues that have vexed women for decades,not centuries, among them equality of pay, professional respect and opportunity.So far, so reasonable. Yet, when I heard Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, talking last week about Mothers of Invention, a podcast she has set up that focusses exclusively on womenrsquos efforts to address climate change, my heart did a double skip: one for delight, two for despair. Delight that women are getting involved directly in trying to help reduce our carbon footprint, without a doubt the most urgent of the worldrsquos ails, but despair at Robinsonrsquos smug assumption that ldquoitrsquos women who change behaviour, in the family and the community.Letrsquos put aside for a moment the fact that, as Robinson reveals in her recent book, Climate Justice, her own awareness of environmental calamity dawned on her like a Damascene conversion astonishingly late in the day. What sets my teeth on edge is the sanctimonious way in which women are increasingly frequently being portrayed ndash mostly by other women. Itrsquos asthere is a collective halo that needs constant polishing, lest it lose its lustre. Indeed, it seems you cannot these days be a female in a position of influence or authority without feeling the urge ndash or the pressure ndash to add a stone to the cairn of womenrsquos rights, entitlements and endeavours.Donrsquot misunderstand me. I am an old-style feminist, and decry utterly the unfair, oppressive and sometimes iniquitous treatment of women in our and other societies. Men have an awful lot to answer for, today and in the past. But I get decidedly uneasy at the perceptual ide that appears to be widening between the sexes. Climate change, said Robinson, is ldquoman-made, and she enjoys using the term, even though admitting it embraces men and women. But apart from this deliberate provocation, is she really correct in assuming that women change attitudes more widely than men Maybe it depends on what sort of country yoursquore living in. When I look around the UK, I donrsquot recognise that stark distinction. Plenty of men seem to be trying to bring about green change, ethical enlightenment, societal improvement, better childcare and education, and are working towards this alongside women. Sometimes, for heavenrsquos sake, they are even taking the lead.Meanwhile, children in two-parent families are open to influences from both parents. While women still tend to spend more time with their young, this does not necessarily equate to a more lasting influence on their behaviour or outlook. The other day my husbandrsquos granddaughter rushed to interrupt her mother who was on the phone to announce that Liverpool had just scored a fourth goal against Newcastle ndash whose influence was that We are going through a phase where almost every interview with a woman politician or banker, entrepreneur or artist, includes the obligatory question about #MeToo, in the same way that every American is asked their opinion of Trump. And while it obviously takes women at the top to help bring about change for those lower down the ladder ndash or in the community at large ndash it is surely not a sacred obligation placed upon each of them. To assume that is to be sexist and discriminatory. Itrsquos certainly not an expectation placed upon men.Yet to listen to some womenrsquos outrage, yoursquod think therersquos a contract, signed at birth, that insists women pay especial attention to female issues eventhere are things that interest them more. Florence Nightingale and Elsie Inglis personally helped save hundreds of lives, and their influence rippled down the decades to the benefit of all, women as much as men. Yet their initial impulse was not to improve things for their own kind, but to help wounded soldiers and the sick and dying. In other words, to improve the conditions of humanity as a whole, not one gender or the other.Of course splinter groups and special interest parties can make things change ndash just look at Dr Inglisrsquos formidable all-women hospitals. There is a galvanising power and collective spirit in female solidarity that nobody can deny. So letrsquos hear it for women tackling climate change. And for men too.In these unsettling and perilous times we surely need to remember that we are all just people. Our identity is not primarily male or female, trans, intersex, other, or whatever label fits. We are simply and essentially human, with all the complexities of personality, type, and biases that entails. Since wersquore in it all together, thatrsquos also how we should sort things out."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-review-luther-is-back-and-guess-who-knocked-on-his-door","story":"Doctor Who BBC ***A SUSPECT sprints into a dockyard, pursued by a Volvo driven by a demon lawman.

Previously, it was Cornelius who had been chained to a radiator by Luther, because Luther is that kind of cop.Besides Corneliusrsquos missing son, London crime figures were being boosted by a serial killer who liked to torture and mutilate his victims. Luther had seen worse, unlike ambitious new start DS Catherine Halliday .Cross introduced regular characters at a steady pace and soon it was like the old team had never been away. But where was the lady of the hour, the one we were all waiting for  Alice Morgan , the killer who struck up such a close relationship with Luther the pair were going to run off together, was officially dead, off the case. But in the worst kept secret since the colour of the sky, we knew she was coming back, but when and why  By the end of the first instalment, this four parter, continuing tonight, looked set to be the Luther that really lets rip. Bring it on.This time last year, Doctor Who fans had been given a sneak peek at the first woman Time Lord, played by Jodie Whittaker. Having made her debut proper in October, Whittaker spearheaded another move, replacing the traditional Christmas Day special with a Nersquoer Day one. This, too, promised theof a familiar character, this one ldquothe most dangerous creature in the universe according to The Doctor. And it wasnrsquot even Donald Trump. Clue: this one did not do stairs.After a complicated preamble about some warmongering creature cut into three and buried in dferent parts of the world, the action switched to the present day where an ancient burial site was being excavated. Before you could say, ldquoThis is slightly more exciting than Time Team, a squid-like creature, later identied as a Dalek without its casing, had escaped and was declaring its intention to destroy humanity. They never change, do they Fans had been promised an all-action Doctor Who. More money had been spent, but there was still a lot of time spent talking in the TARDIS, and the Dalek advance party looked as naff and tin-can like as ever, especially when flying. The most impressive thing on screen was Whittaker, throwing herself into the epic daftness with the energy of several doctors.Love won the day, with Ryanrsquos estranged father turning up and making peace with his son, and The Doctor gathering her little family around her for new adventures. Asked where they were going next, she replied, ldquoEverywhere! It is going to take more than a Dalek to dislodge Whittaker from this gig."},{"url":null,"title":"review-scottish-chamber-orchestra-usher-hall-edinburgh-four-stars","story":"Scottish Chamber OrchestraUsher Hall, EdinburghKeith Brucefour starsAS some citizens of the capital have been crossly pointing out, the history of celebrations of the turn of the year there goes back a great deal further than the time for which Hogmanay has been so successfully exploited for commercial advantage through tourism.However, it is not so very long since the Usher Hall was dark on New Yearrsquos Day because the cost of opening it then was prohibitive.Today, January the first is altogether less dour, with much of Edinburgh open for business and the SCOrsquos New Year Gala in aid of Marie Curie nurses an established,relatively recent, institution ndash and a programme the chamber orchestra takes out on the road, this year to Dumfries , Ayrand Perth .The distant model is that of the Vienna Phil at the Musikverein, whose annual concert of waltzes, marches and polkas was broadcast to the world a few hours earlier, but the SCO, happily, has more freedom of repertoire before the Strauss-soundtracked sprint to the tape of Tristch-Tratsch Polka, Blue Danube Waltz and the obligatory clap-along encore of the Radetsky March.A very full house, with a goodly number sitting in the top tier, likely included a few less experienced classical music fans, so the lack of a singer this year was perhaps regrettable, but the SCO is a band of soloists and this programme was designed to allow a number of them to show their skill.Most obviously that was leader Stephanie Gonley, stepping front of stage for the virtuoso Ravel gypsy violin showpiece Tzigane, but principal cello Philip Higham had been first in the spotlight with the opening of Weberrsquos Invitation to the Dance, as orchestrated by Hector Berlioz, and clarinettist William Stafford , and first horn Alec Frank-Gemmill were also among those featured.This was a large edition of the SCO, with percussionists, five horns, and eight brass, under the direction of Duncan Ward, a young conductor of hugely erse experience who first stepped in to work with orchestra two years ago, and who drew particularly lyrical playing from the strings here."},{"url":null,"title":"2018-tory-brexit-pyschodrama-notches-up-political-casualties-from-beginning-to-end","story":"The latest twists and turns in the Tory psychodrama over Brexit began in January with a reshuffle, which simply emphasised how Theresa May was getting weaker and weaker.Jeremy Hunt refused to be moved from Health to Business and, instead, got Social Care added to his brief. Justine Greening refused to move from Education to Work and Pensions and so left Government, the first of several.Just to underline how reshuffles are iniably fraught affairs, the Prime Ministerrsquos decision to appoint Maria Caulfield as the new Conservative vice-chairwoman for women was hit by a tide of criticism from womenrsquos campaigners given the Sussex MP opposes the decriminalisation of abortion. Ironically, her tenure would last just six months. She resigned in July. Over Brexit. What  At the end of January a leaked government paper showed that Brexit would damage the UK economy no matter what kind of deal was agreed as much as eight per cent of GDP growth would go up in smoke within  years.In the spring, tensions mounted as the Lords inflicted a series of defeats on the Government on, among others, the customs union, removing the March  exit date and citizensrsquo rights they would later be overturned in the Commons. But the heat was rising.At the May elections in England, the Tories avoided a humiliating result, losing only  seats while Labour and the Liberal Democrats gained  and  respectively. Naturally, they talked up the results but in the past the Opposition have picked up hundreds of seats at the governing partyrsquos expense.By July the Tory psychodrama moved into a key act with a marathon Cabinet meeting at Chequers and the agreement on the way forward: Mrs Mayrsquos deal or no-deal.Yet, within  hours David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, would resign, followed by his Brexit department colleague Steve Baker. The plan for a free trade area was too much as it would bind the UK to EU rules this was not aof sovereignty, insisted the departing ministers, but vassalage.Then  hours later Boris Johnson resigned as Foreign Secretary, denouncing how the Brexit ldquodream is dying. Within another  hours Ms Caulfield and Ben Bradley had resigned their Tory Party positions as vice-chairmen.But the resignations stopped there the Tory avalanche did not happen even though the damage was bad enough. Two of the original Brexiteers, Gove and Fox remainedAs the UKrsquos long hot summer rolled on, relief was at hand.Donald Trump finally turned up on British shores to give the Brexit soap opera a bit of American pizzazz not that it needed it. The US President demanded tea with the Queen and teed off at Turnberry. In between, there was the little matter of a meeting with Mrs May at Chequers ndash where  The US Presidentrsquos guile as a businessman meant he sought to disorientate his host even before the summit had begun with an interview with the Brexit-friendly Sun in which he damned the PMrsquos Withdrawal Plan, saying it would \"probably kill\" any trade deal with America.He then sought to brand the interview ldquofake news even though what he was complaining about was all on tape. Which gave us an insight into how Mr Trump handles the Press.It also emerged The Donald had given The Theresa a bit of helpful advice: sue the EU.Just before the summer recess the PMrsquos Chequers Plan was formally declared dead as the Government accepted changes to its plan on trade by Jacob Rees-Moggrsquos European Research Group. No  insisted the changes were consistent with Mrs Mayrsquos proposal but it looked like many to a cave-in to keep the hard right-wingers on board.The Government began its tranche of technical notices on what would happenthere were a no-deal, including sending in the Army to deliver food, medicine and fuel supplies. Supermarkets were also beginning to stockpile.There have, of course, been the occasional distractions from the runaway train that is Brexit some offering genuine relief to the Tories and others just piling on the pressure.They included the plunge in UK-Russia relations over the attempted poisoning of the Skripals using a military grade nerve agent and the subsequent murder of Dawn Sturgess the Windrush scandal that cost Amber Rudd her job as Home Secretary the purported ldquoend of austerity with pay rises for public sector workers official approval of the third runway at Heathrow and the football World Cup.Then, of course, there was Ruth Davidson and her uplting announcement that she was pregnant Finn duly arrived in October, meaning that during the ongoing psychodrama at least one senior Tory was back stage, tending to other, more important matters.As the conference season got underway, Brussels delivered its own rebuff to Mrs May, rejecting her Chequers Plan. By the time it came to her keynote conference speech even twinkle-toes Theresa could not bear to mention the phrase by name.As October progressed, the Tory leader was looking for a way out of the seemingly intractable backstop issue and suggested perhaps extending the transition period.Despite her assurances, particularly to the Scottish Conservatives, that Britain would become an independent coastal state by the end of the transition period in December , she conspicuously failed to say what would happenthis were extended. The assumption, certainly in Brussels, was thatthe transition period were extended, then so too would the UKrsquos alignment with the hated EU Common Fisheries Policy. Scottish Secretary David Mundell wrote to the PM, making clear that reneging on commitments to Scotlandrsquos fishermen would be a resigning matter.As autumn progressed pressure was beginning to build from all sides.In late October, some , people marched in London in support of a Peoplersquos Vote anathema to Mrs May.The Confederation of British Industry reported  per cent of UK firms had cancelled or delayed investments due to Brexit uncertainty double the figure from a year earlier.Mid-November saw another landmark Cabinet meeting when, we were told, senior ministers backed the PM and her plan following a ldquolong, detailed and impassioned debate\".But as with Chequers beforehand, the aftermath saw the resignation of another Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab. His Cabinet colleague Esther McVey bailed out too as did two junior ministers.Crucially, the others on resignation-watch did not follow suit most notably Michael Gove, who stayed on as Environment Secretary to fight to change the deal in the mid to long term. If he had gone, then the Scot might have sparked the departure of others and brought Mrs May down.At yet another EU summit, the EU agreed the PMrsquos Plan, the ldquobest and only deal possible.Tensions mounted in SW as the anti-EU Tory European Research Group boasted the  signatures needed to mount a no-confidence vote were in but then had to back down. Their day would come though.By now the pyschodrama was entering the beginning of its most crucial act at Westminster.After yet another ministerial resignation, Sam Gyimahrsquos - the th - the Government was found in contempt of Parliament for failing to publish in full the Attorney Generalrsquos legal advice. MPs also voted for the amendment tabled by former Tory Cabinet Minister Dominic Grieve to give Parliament control should Mrs Mayrsquos Plan be rejected.The next day, the Government published the legal advice, revealing the backstop could ldquoendure indefinitelyno agreement was reached.The following week saw the most dramatic -hour period in the psychodrama to date.On the day the European Court of Justice ruled Britain could cancel Article  without the consent of the EU, the PM called an emergency Cabinet meeting and announced the postponement of the vote on her deal, knowing she was facing a humiliating defeat.The next day, Mrs May was in Brussels trying to improve the deal, most notably on the backstop, but without joy. At Westminster, MPs debated her decision to pull the vote. Some ministers began to air alternatives to the PMrsquos plan a sure sign she had lost control.Rumours that the  signatures to call a no-confidence vote in the Tory leader abounded and were confirmed the following morning by Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the  Committee. By that afternoon the vote was taken and the PM won the vote. Yet,  Conservative MPs said they had no confidence in her more than a third of the party. She battled on but her authority was badly dented.Jeremy Corbyn tabled a no-confidence vote. But it was not in the Tory Government as a whole, rather in Mrs Mayrsquos leadership alone. This meant, by parliamentary convention, the Government did not have to allow Commons time for a debate and a vote. Critics said it was nothing more than an empty gesture.And now as we gird our loins for the next intensive episode of what has become a national psychodrama, who knows how many more political casualties there will be. By the end of this month Mrs May could well be one of them."},{"url":null,"title":"disappointed-by-tv-version-of-les-mis-here-comes-the-real-thing","story":"ldquoThose pictures looked exactly like the set of Les Miserables, says the composer of one of the most iconic pieces of musical theatre in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.ldquoFirst of all it made me realise that Les Miserables is still relevant. Secondly, it also made me realise that in  years we have learnt nothing.Maybe this is why the current year-long UK tour of Les Miserables, originally adapted by Schonberg and writer Alan Boublil from Victor Hugorsquos  novel, has pretty much sold out already.Arriving in Edinburgh this month for the first time in  years for a month-long run, the English-language version of Boublil and Schonbergrsquos show has been a fixture of the London theatre circuit since Trevor Nunn directed a co-production between the Royal Shakespeare Company and Cameron Mackintosh at the Barbican in .This makes it the second longest-running musical in the world.Despite the success of putting Hugorsquos story charting ex-convict Jean Valjeanrsquos travails through poverty-stricken France onstage, Schonberg for one isnrsquot quite sure of the reasons why it happened.ldquoItrsquos a phenomenon I donrsquot really understand, the now -year old composer admits of a creation which introduced the world to songs now regarded as modern classics such as I Dreamed A Dream, ldquobut the show is more popular than ever. I must say, Irsquom totally surprised.By the time Les Miserables opens at the Festival Theatre in Edinburgh, the new six-part TV adaptation of Hugorsquos book scripted by Andrew Davies will be mid-way through its own run. With Dominic West playing Valjean as part of a cast that includes Olivia Coleman and David Oyelowo, rather than claiming kin with Boublil and Schonbergrsquos take on things, advance publicity appears to pointing up the fact that it is categorically not the musical, and shouldnrsquot be confused as such. Viewers and critics have already criticised this sans songs version as being flat.With Les Mis the musical itself filmed in  with Hugh Jackman as Valjean, this too is something Schonberg doesnrsquot understand.ldquoWhenever I read an article about the BBC version, they are saying it is the real version of the novel and not the trivial musical stage version, he says.ldquoI donrsquot know how you can promote something against it. People know the title because of the musical show, but each time therersquos an adaptation, they all make the point that they are not going to have anyone singing. But who knows  This one might be very good. I will look at it carefully.Schonberg probably doesnrsquot need to worry too much. As he points out, there has been more than  films based on Hugorsquos novel, with over  TV adaptations as well as another  dferent versions onstage. This is how great stories work as they are reimagined for every age. Indeed, it was another musical adaptation of a nineteenth century novel that was the starting point for Les Miserables.ldquoAlain saw Oliver! in London, says Schonberg, who had previously collaborated with Boublil on La Revolution Francaise, Francersquos first rock opera, produced in . ldquoI said to Alain, next time we find a big subject, we have it as a sung-through musical, and when Alain saw Oliver!, that gave us an idea about how to do it.Lionel Bartrsquos musical version of Charles Dickensrsquo novel, Oliver Twist, had already been adapted for film by Carol Reed in  by then, after being first seen on the West End eight years earlier. Prior to putting Les Miserables onstage, as was the fashion then, Boublil and Schonberg released a recording of it as a concept album. This approach had already paid idends for the English musical theatre team of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita, and Schonberg had already scored hit records in France.Three years after the Les Miserables concept album had led to the showrsquos original French production, it was heard by British producer Cameron Mackintosh after it was passed on to him by director Peter Farago.ldquoTwo years after the show closed in Paris, Cameron was organising his records and put it on, Schonberg recalls. ldquoand after that we heard he was looking for those crazy French guys, Schonberg and BoublilWhile the pair worked on new drafts of Les Miserables, Mackintosh was riding high on the success of Cats, directed by Trevor Nunn, who had also overseen David Edgarrsquos epic staging of Dickensrsquo Nicholas Nickleby, and knew how to put on a big show. Success was far from guaranteed, however, and the opening night of Les Mis was a critical disaster.ldquoThe critics were very bad,rsquo says Schonberg, actually using the v word eight times. ldquoCameron has a tradition of having a lunch the day after an opening night, and it was like a funeral. We thought it was finished, and during the lunch Cameron kept trying to call the box office to measure the scale of the disaster, but couldnrsquot get through. Eventually he received a message to say that the reason he couldnrsquot get through was that the show had sold , tickets, and in two weeks would be sold out.Les Miserables went on to win an Olivier Award for the most popular show, while on Broadway it won three Tony awards.The current touring version is directed by Laurence Connor and James Powell for a production reinvigorated for the showrsquos th anniversary in . The result is a very st century Les Mis, which utilises projections based on paintings by Hugo created by son et lumiere auteurs Fty-Nine Productions. The internationally renowned team led by Leo Warner and Mark Grimmer, who have come a long way since their early work at the Traverse Theatre, the National Theatre of Scotland and with Stellar Quines Theatre Company.Having worked worldwide on the National Theatrersquos production of War Horse and the  Olympics, more recently  have been responsible for opening events of the Edinburgh International Festival, Deep Time, Bloom and the First World war-themed Five Telegrams. The latter projected images onto the walls of the Usher Hall accompanied by a thundering score by Anna Meredith.ldquoThere have been so many improvements to Les Miserable this year,rsquo says Schonberg. ldquoThat has a lot to do with technological developments which wouldnrsquot have been possible even five years ago.This keeps the show fresh for several generations of theatre-goers, as was proven last week, when Schonberg met a woman who told him how shersquod seen Les Miserables a staggering  times.ldquoFor Christmas she was taking her children and grand-children to see the show with hr again,rsquo he says.What Les Miserables taps into, again, Schonberg isnrsquot sure about. All he can say is that ldquoI think we did the right job, but it is the novel that is responsible for the success of the show, and for whatever reason, people seem to leave the theatre a bit dferent. People are scared for the future. Theyrsquore all looking for a bright tomorrow and waiting for the sun to shine, and people come out of the show perhaps believing they can be a better person.Les Miserables, Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, January -February .www.capitaltheatreswww.lesmis"},{"url":null,"title":"impact-of-brexit-on-scotlands-construction-sector-to-be-examined-by-holyrood","story":"The inquiry will also consider the effect technological changes and automation will have on the industry - which employs more than , people, % of the Scottish workforce.The work is to be carried out by the Economy, Energy and Fair Work Committee, with convener Gordon Lindhurst saying MSPs are keen to discover how challenges facing the building industry can be overcome.:Scottish construction firms fear Brexit will hike labour costsHe said: \"Construction is a vital sector in Scotland as it drives and underpins the economy with its knock-on effect on other sectors.\"As well as being a major employer, the sector also delivers infrastructure for housing, transport, education and community, and contributes pound. billion to Scotlands gross domestic product.\"However, the sector has its challenges and we want to hear views and suggestions on how these can be overcome.

But he declined to give any details of the buyer or the company bought.He stressed that Scottish underworld figures, who have traditionally protected their own turf from overseas gangsters, were also actively purchasing distressed real-world businesses to expand their grip well beyond their heartlands in the poorest communities of the Central Belt.BACKGROUND:Police chief saysScotland must wake up to threat of criminals taking over businessIn an exclusive interview with The Herald, Mr Murray effectively sounded a wake-up call about the threat of organised crime infiltration into Scotlandrsquos legitimate economy.The investigator said: ldquoWe are lucky in Scotland.

He is talking about the purchase by gangsters of real-world business which employ real people and do real business in Scotland.And he believes the consequences for failing to deal with this criminalisation could be grave. Mr Murray said: ldquoThe fundamental penalty for allowing an accumulation of criminal cash in the economy is that it is a drag on the economy.

The only thing that ies is which party itrsquos coming from. The script itself is always much the same.Yet, while the electorate remains sceptical of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnellrsquos overall economic strategy of aping Venezuela, the policy of renationalising rail attracts considerable support. This is despite the fact that, as often as not, problems that affect rail travellers are the responsibility of the UK Government-owned Network Rail, and that two-thirds of the cost of running our railways is provided by Scottish Government subsidy. The increases here, meanwhile, though well ahead of the general rate of inflation, are actually slightly lower than those south of the Border.Whatrsquos more, the parts of the UKrsquos railways that are privatised compare very favourably with the old British Rail and with rail networks in other countries. The last major comparison of European rail networks, five years ago, found that the UK had improved in efficiency and customer satisfaction more than any of the other  countries examined, while, in terms of passenger kilometres, rail use has almost doubled since , from . per cent of all journeys to nearly nine per cent now. Itrsquos also the safest in the EU .A recent report by the Centre for Policy Studies concluded that the cost of fares is almost the only measure on which UK rail compares badly with other countries. And though you would never think it from talking to rail users or from media coverage, the UK scores highest in terms of customer satisfaction of the six largest European networks , according to a Eurobarometer poll last September.That certainly wouldnrsquot have been the case when the railways were last entirely in public ownership, but then nostalgia for some ldquogolden age of rail transport is usually misplaced. The best services, in terms of both comprehensive coverage and affordability were during the late Victorian age, when there were about  dferent private companies, and after theto private ownership in , when the ldquoBig Four ran a very effective service.Between then and the outbreak of the Second World War, they conveyed more passengers than the total carried in the United States and, during the s, covered more passenger miles, despite the vast dference in distances. And did so while saving pound million ndash  per cent of expenditure ndash over that period. By , savings were at a rate of poundm per year. The only comparable increase in productivity, in fact, has been since the reprivatisation of the s.The postwar period of nationalised British Rail, by contrast, was marked by continual decline ndash not helped, of course, by the ldquoreforms imposed in  by Dr Beeching, which saw a quarter of the network axed.Much of this, of course, had causes other than the way in which the rail system was owned and operated. The growth of private car ownership was almost certainly the major factor. But it does suggest that nationalisation is not an automatic way of improving performance.And that figure of nine per cent of all passenger kilometres travelled, evenit is a substantial rise, indicates that rail travellers are in a small minority, especially when you take into account that people are more likely to take the train for longer journeys. Almost  per cent of people in the UK didnrsquot get on a train at all last year, while the average number of rail journeys for the whole population was two, for a total distance of  miles. Given that many peoplecommute more than  miles daily by train, rail ndash though it gets the most attention of any aspect of public transport ndash does not matter to vast sections of the population.Ah, you say, but more people would travel by trainthe fares were reasonable, as they are in most other European countries. That may be true, though the system is stretched beyond its capacity just now, so it may not be a terric idea. One indication of that strain is that total passenger journeys have doubled over the last decade, but the number of trains being run has increased by  per cent.The chief reason that fares are cheaper on the Continent, however, is that they are subsidised from general taxation or rather, more subsidised than under our system. Rail travel itself isnrsquot cheaper where, itrsquos just that the cost is distributed dferently. The French taxpayer, for example, pays twice as much as the UK citizen towards the railways.There doesnrsquot seem to me to be an overwhelming argument for getting taxpayers, rather than rail travellers, to pay for trains. Especially since most people seldom or never use them and ndash across great swathes of the country, particularly outside the large metropolitan areas ndash couldnrsquot, eventhey wanted to.Since itrsquos also true that most British rail users are richer than the average member of the public, and that almost  per cent of rail journeys are to get to work, or for business purposes, the case for greater subsidy of rail fares is, in reality, an argument for getting ordinary taxpayers to subsidise firms in large cities, and thefairly well-paid professionals who work in them.Evenyou still wanted the poorer taxpayer, whose only transport option may be an inadequate bus service, to subsidise rich commutersrsquo fares, itrsquos not an argument for nationalisation. Yoursquod just spend the money on direct subsidy of fares. In fact, the additional costs of nationalisation, and the decline in service that previous experience suggests would go with it, would make cutting fares even less affordable."},{"url":null,"title":"the-herald-diary-are-we-running-from-the-english-again","story":"THERES been a lot of Billy Connolly on the telly recently.

Unfortunately the ferry firm awarded this pound.m contract has no ferries.Boaty McWithoutABoatFace.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling defended the decision, saying the government is supporting new British businesses and isnt that what Brexit means  Theres some sort of analogy there, something about staring down an empty hollow of pastry.Its always fascinating, the issues that work folk into a lather. Who knew the replacement of sausage with fermented fungus would be one of them, rather than the avant garde apportioning of public funds.Perhaps for Christmas the nation has been granted the wisdom to know the dference between the things it can and cannot change. For  well sweat the small stuff.Or perhaps the Greggs vegan sausage roll is a useful hate figure to unite us as a nation  Except in Dundee, where the item is not yet available. Hasnt Greggs heard of the cultural revolution taking over Scotlands fourth largest city. What an unacceptable snub.There are accusations that Seaborne Freight copied its terms and conditions wholesale from a takeaway food firm, with wording including: \"Please provide additional delivery instructions in the relevant section on our checkout page.\"Perhaps the shipping company and the bakers can unite with vegan sausage rolls delivered by boat along the River Tay.While Christmas officially finishes on Sunday with the arrival of Twelfth Night, resolve to be clean-living, upstanding members of society begins on January . This year record numbers have signed up for Veganuary, an event requiring pledgers to go vegan for one month. It now comes with the caveat that eating sausage rolls three times a day for  days defeats the purpose.Others - or perhaps the same fine people - will also take part in Dry January, eschewing booze for the month.There are two camps on this issue: those left feeling that the festive period has left them nine tenths lard and one tenth sherry with a desperate urge to recalibrate, and those who feel theres no point being abstemious in January when there are leftovers to clear and bleak weather to comfort themselves through.The first has a bad rep as being smug, the second is scornful of the first. Neither stance is particularly compatible with goodwill to all men but it is indicative of our nations uncomfortable and seemingly unshtable relationship with our own health.There is a blind and socially acceptable hatred for vegans because we cant stand feeling judged. Even quiet vegans, those who dont picket restaurants or hover in balaclavas with placards on the high street, are scorned.Their mere existence is a comment on our bacon guzzling, planet destroying ways. Vegetarians are alright, they still eat cheese. This is why the vegetarian McDonalds Happy Meal was received with barely a blink you dont feel undermined by a vegetarian, they have their flaws.Vegans are walking embodiments of virtue, silently chiding us for all our flaws.Of course, the impression is a crude one. There are strong arguments that grazing cattle are much more beneficial to the environment than industrially grown maize, grains and soya, as one example.Veganism is rapidly entering the mainstream, however. Greater numbers of people are embracing the lestyle and what could be a clearer totem of this than Greggs clambering aboard,youll allow the extension of the metaphor.After Brexit, comes the warning, butter will become an occasional luxury and, with government appointed boat-free shipping companies, it looks like well be lining up to beg for vegan sausage rolls.So lets not be too hasty about this pastry just yet, eh "},{"url":null,"title":"uks-first-battery-powered-hotel-opens-in-edinburgh","story":"The Gyle Premier Inn at Edinburgh Park has installed a five-tonne battery which will charge from the national grid during off-peak periods and power the -room site for several hours each day.:Revealed: A third of the UKs electricity came from renewables in The m lithium ion battery is expected to save the hotel pound, a year on its energy bill, and is able to power the whole venue, including the restaurant, for up to three hours at a time after a two-hour charge.Premier Inns parent company Whitbread said the trial of the battery storage technology will help its commitment to halve its carbon emissions by .Cian Hatton, Whitbreads head of energy and environment, said: \"Batteries are of course everyday items, more commonly associated with powering small household goods like the TV remote control, so its incredibly exciting to launch the UKs first battery-powered hotel -

nightmare","story":"Former RAF pilot Don Mason, who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Years Honours List in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Friday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

EIS concerns were submitted in evidence to the Scottish Parliament’s education and skills committee inquiry into the first year of SNSAs .Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, said assessments had largely breached agreed guidelines.“The EIS has been baffled by the intensity with which the Scottish Government appear welded to the principle of National Standardised Assessment,” he said. “Since , no-one in Scotland has come forward with substantial evidence of the virtue of such a model, nor has any academic journal or conclusive system research been cited as the rationale for SNSAs as a tool for realising greater educational equity. “On the contrary, there is strong evidence to suggest large-scale standardised testing is an inhibitor of equity and of student wellbeing, which is inextricably linked to young people’s ability to make good progress in learning.“The EIS is of the firm view that all assessment should genuinely support learning.“Unfortunately, our initial evaluation in the first year of SNSA implementation is a negative one. The future of SNSAs should be decided on educational research evidence and not on party politicking.”A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “The Scottish National Standardised Assessments were specically designed for the Scottish curriculum and provide teachers with standard, consistent and comparable information related to everyday learning. “We have made clear that assessment has long been an important part of the improvement agenda and teachers with experience of using the assessments have spoken of how useful they are as one of a range of ways to gauge a pupil’s progression.“Our user review of the first year of operation sets out enhancements and improvements for this year, which will provide a better experience for younger pupils and extra reassurance to teachers and parents. “An independent, evidence-led review into the future of P assessments has also been announced by the Deputy First Minister.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4850066.1546196471!/image/image.jpg","title":"survey finds st kilda sea caves in good condition","story":"Researchers have captured #stunning# images of marine le in the waters around St Kilda as a survey revealed its reefs and sea caves are in good condition.Scottish Natural Heritagehas just published the findings of the wide-reaching survey which was carried out in  by a team of ers.Home to nearly one million seabirds, the St Kilda archipelago is the UK’s only dual Unesco World Heritage Site for both its natural and cultural signicance.It was evacuated on August ,  after the remaining  islanders voted to leave as their way of le was no longer sustainable.The survey aimed to judge the current condition of the sea caves in the archipelago, which is situated around  miles west of the outer Hebrides and, in North Rona, north-west of Cape Wrath.The team of researchers concluded that the site was in “good condition”.The researchers also discovered a new species of soft coralwithin one of the St Kilda caves.SNH said that St Kilda hosts huge seabird populations, including the world’s second largest colony of North Atlantic gannets.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4851631.1546542834!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit delay of deal with eu utterly reckless leader comment","story":"The idea the UK could wait until the last minute to strike a trade deal with the EU is reckless in the extreme.With time running out to agree a Brexit deal, one would have thought every MP in the country would be gripped by a sense of urgency. But no.As their -day recess draws to a close, there came an extraordinary suggestion from former Brexit Secretary David Davis. Rather than get on with the post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union that British businesses desperately need, he claimed Theresa May should delay the vote on her unpopular plan for a second time.According to Davis, the UK can still achieve much better terms with the EU but onlyit waits until “the eleventh hour”. Despite the EU’s insistence that no other deal is on the table, Davis said waiting until the last moment would force a rethink. “Time is our friend,” he wrote in the , “the more we prepare to leave the EU without a deal, the more likely a good deal becomes.”: Brexit: Theresa May urged to delay meaningful vote for a second timeThe reason, he claimed, was that the EU was worried about the loss of the £ billion that is the UK’s share of EU liabilities. Essentially, he is suggesting that the UK Government plays a game of chicken with the EU until the moments before  March. The trouble is,there is a crash, it is the UK economy that is likely to be wrecked while the EU juggernaut continues on with perhaps a few dents.This astonishingly cavalier and reckless suggestion epitomises too many pronouncements from the hard Brexiteers in parliament. It is also fundamentally dishonourable. The £bn is the UK’s share of liabilities for things like civil servants’ pensions. It should not be used as a bargaining chip. Failing to pay would be like going out to dinner with  other people and then leaving without paying your share of the bill because you had a disagreement. If the UK does not pay up, it will damage our reputation on the international stage as a country that subscribes to the rule of law, that can be trusted, that pays its debts. The suggestion we might not pay should be discarded along with wild ideas that post-Brexit UK could start selling knock-off ‘Champagne’.MPs need to hold the “meaningful vote” on May’s deal as soon as possible to establish whether it is politically viable or not. Businesses and investors need to have an idea of what the UK is going to be like in less than three months’ time. Any sensible politician should understand this.

That is not just something to say to mark the start of , it is also an expression of ambition and hope. And one which is in our power to realise in what is a milestone year for Scotland.This year is the th anniversary of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament. It is therefore an ideal opportunity to assess where we are as a country, whether we have achieved all that we thought we would and what we will need to do dferently.Like thousands of others in the Scottish Labour Party, the trade union movement, and wider civic Scotland I campaigned for a Scottish Parliament and I was proud to do so. The Parliament we wanted – and still do – is one that provides a  to lt families out of poverty, to tackle injustice. Ultimately, to change and improve people’s lives. We wanted a Parliament for real change, to exercise power for a purpose, not just for its own sake.The late Donald Dewar – former Labour MP and Scotland’s inaugural First Minister – reflected this in his speech at its opening. That speech was full of ambition and of hope. He said the Parliament was about much more than politics and the laws that would be passed by MSPs, he said that it was about “who we are, how we carry ourselves”. This was a vision of a Parliament for Scotland not just as an end in itself but, he said, as “a means to greater ends”.Twenty years on, what has happened to that ambition  How can we carry ourselves with pride and purpose when one in four children spent this Christmas living in poverty  When our public services are so under-resourced that health boards are on the brink of going bust when teachers and parents are having to sound alarm bells about the state of our education system and when  workers at the Kaiam computer plant in Livingston can be told on Christmas Eve that they no longer have a job despite, we now know, ministers knowing weeks in advance that the firm would likely close.Labour has called for an inquiry in the Kaiam closure. We want to look at it as a specic case but also the questions it raises about how the Scottish Government uses financial assistance, how the money gets spent, what systems are in place to account for it, who is responsible and how sustainable it is.: HES collapse: Waste firm ceases operations after backlog controversyThat’s why, in the last few days, I have met with workers from Healthcare Environmental Servicesin Shotts who, in a viable business they have helped to build, find themselves without pay, without a job and facing the need to take court action to secure what they are owed. We really need a fundamental review of the balance of power between workers and owners in a situation like this: and we need to find a solution to rescue what we can to safeguard these jobs and good standards of public and environmental health.Labour has a vision for the future, of how to rebalance our economy to prevent these closures from happening so we are not just reacting to industrial change – because Kaiam and HES are far from the first and,we carry on as we are, they won’t be the last. Over the last  years, Scotland’s manufacturing base has shrunk and the service sector has grown – and at the same time we have witnessed a rise in insecure work, low pay and worsening terms and conditions.We need a much more proactive, forward-looking planned approach that involves workers, instead of regarding the threat to their livelihoods as the unfortunate consequence of the inevitable decline of industry. We often talk about this as being an ‘industrial strategy’ but really it ought to be common sense.And that applies whether it’s Michelin in Dundee or Ferguson Marine, Tata Steel, and BiFab – where this time last year Labour and the unions were applauding the Government for stepping in, but where now we are left with three yards, only with no workers in them.It goes without saying that we need a better approach, one that ties together investment in yards like these – so they have the right infrastructure and the workers have the right skills – with investment in offshore renewable energy technology. Our approach would bring together industrial leaders and trade unions to plan ahead.For too long, politicians have allowed ‘the market’ – which in reality means big business and wealthy speculators – to run our economy. It hasn’t been run in the interests of people. Labour would do things very dferently. We want to give workers the right to buy their businessit is put up for sale or facing closure. This is common in other European countries, they’ve had something like this in Italy for  years.: Kaiam boss tells workers: ‘I’m sorry, I failed’We also want to see more democracy in our economy. We live in a country that was once at the cutting edge of the co-operative movement, where workers own and run their enterprise, sharing in the gains and ensuring everyone benefits, not just a privileged few. I would like to see Scotland becoming a beacon for this kind of ownership model once again.These are big challenges that risk being overshadowed and overlooked. Over the last few years, too many politicians have been guilty of offering one-trick solutions to multi-sided problems, whether that’s independence or Brexit.But Brexit actually makes all of these things more immediate and important. It is why I have consistently said that we can’t allow it as an issue in and of itself to ert our attention from issues like housing shortages and homelessness, or the rise in the use foodbanks, and generally from the transformative changes we need to make to our economy.It is also why I believe constantly trying to revive the idea of another independence referendum is an unnecessary and dangerous distraction. To view everything through this prism is an abdication of responsibility. The last thing we need is more instability and chaos, what we need is real change of the kind many of us hoped and campaigned for  years ago.I believed then in devolution and I still do. No one can predict what this year will bring. But Scottish Labour will put that spirit of ambition and hope that marked the start of the Parliament in  at the heart of everything we do in .©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4851639.1546546750!/image/image.jpg","title":"200m festival fringe boost to edinburgh s economy","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Edinburgh Festival Fringe is now worth more than # milion for the first time, according to organisers.The value of the event is thought to have increased by at least a quarter in the space of eight years as both its programme and audience have swelled in size.Organisers say the event’s value - which has risen more than £ million since the last official research was done in  - demonstrates how it has become “an economic powerhouse in its own right.”The Fringe has also highlighted that more than , tickets are now sold to people in Edinburgh for shows- representing around a fth of all admissions.

A total of  per cent had no preference.The poll also suggested a two-way referendum would see  per cent of Tory members endorse the PM’s stance, with  per cent voting for a no-deal Brexit.The research was carried out by YouGov for the Party Members Project, which studies membership of the UK’s six biggest parties and is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.The overwhelming rejection of Mrs May’s deal shown in the survey comes at a crucial time for the PM as she faces a crunch Commons vote on her plans.After Mrs May suddenly pulled a vote on the Withdrawal Agreement in December because it faced a signicant defeat, MPs are to begin debating the proposals again next Wednesday with a vote scheduled for the following week.: Poll: % of Labour members back second Brexit voteThe poll of Tory members is bad news for Mrs May’s hopes of winning support for her deal, said Professor Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London who led research into the findings.He said: “If Theresa May is hoping that her MPs willto Westminster having been persuaded by their constituency associations to back her Brexit deal, she’s going to be disappointed.“It appears that those members are in no mood for compromise.“Moreover, the Tory rank and file, it seems, are convinced that no deal is better than May’s deal.”He suggested there were two specic issues behind the opposition to Mrs May’s deal, the first being the Irish backstop.“Tory members have become convinced that the Irish backstop is a bad idea,” he said, citing that  per cent think it is a reason in itself to reject a deal, and  per cent think it is irrelevant because Mrs May’s deal “is a bad one anyway”.The second issue is that  per cent of members believed warnings that a no-deal Brexit would cause serious disruption are “exaggerated or invented”.“In short, Mrs May has failed not only to convince the country, and quite probably Parliament, that her Brexit deal is a good one, she has also failed to convince the party faithful,” Prof Bale said.The poll findings came as Mrs May’s Brexit agenda was hit by a series of blows.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds insisted his party’s opposition to Irish border backstop proposals had not lessened after a meeting with the Prime Minister on Thursday.Mr Dodds said: “The Withdrawal Agreement, as currently proposed, flies in the face of the Government’s commitments on Northern Ireland as we leave the EU.”However, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar insisted there could be no changes to the backstop, which is intended to prevent a hard border in Ireland by ensuring the UK abides by EU customs rulesno trade deal is agreed by the end of a Brexit transition period.: Brexit: Delay of deal with EU utterly reckless – leader commentMr Varadkar said he had spoken to German chancellor Angela Merkel by telephone on Thursday and the two leaders agreed to “stand by” the Brexit deal.He said: “We’re happy to offer reassurances and guarantees to the UK, but not reassurances and guarantees that contradict or change what was agreed back in November.”As the EU closed ranks, the European Commission confirmed “no further meetings are foreseen” with the UK on updating Mrs May’s Brexit deal because negotiations have concluded.Mrs May is pressing European leaders for more flexibility on the Irish backstop as a way of garnering more backbench support for her exit plans.Meanwhile, police forces are planning for a iety of Brexit eventualities, including no deal and its potential consequences in Northern Ireland.The National Police Chiefs’ Council said: “Police forces continue to prepare for possible eventualities as exit from the European Union draws nearer.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line. It cannot and will not be abandoned or renegotiated,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland. was a milestone in a changing Ireland. It was given voice in the Repeal referendum. In Belfast the largest political demonstration was Pride. For this generation the border is an anachronism. When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27510  ","story":"Civil Rights marchers attacked at Burntollet Bridge.

offer in case of emergency card","story":"Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Policing and Community Safety Partnership , in partnership with local police is launching a new community safety initiative, in case of emergency card , to make sure people get the best treatment at a time when they need it most.Indicating who should be contacted in the event of an accident or emergency, the ICE Card also provides your medical information including any conditions or allergies you may have, medication you are taking and your blood type.An emergency can strike anywhere - you might be far from home, family or friends - and carrying the ICE Card means that your loved ones can be reached quickly and avoids the problem of unlocking mobile for emergency details.Stressing the importance of carrying an ICE Card, Chair of ABC PCSP, Councillor Joe Nelson commented: “This is a very simple yet effective initiative. Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern Ireland residents to look out for vulnerable relatives after two people robbed of thousands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8756119.1546445050!/image/image.jpg","title":"st colman s have a super tour","story":"Local families attending the Family Health Initiative at St Colman#s Primary School recently visited Moundview Eurospar in Dromore for a supermarket tour.The Family Health Initiative is a healthy lestyle programme delivered by Early Years- the organisation for young children in the Southern Trust and is funded by the Public Health Agency.During the supermarket tour both parents and children took part in a fantastic scavenger hunt to find all the healthy food items on their sheet.

Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-28-at-13.57.45-copy-2.png","title":"when america bombed its own citizens","story":"FEW of us could point out Puerto Rico on a map of the world but fewer still are aware that this tiny Caribbean island, now a US territory, once boasted an independence movement which collaborated with De Valera. That gap in our knowledge has now been put right with the the timely publication of the powerful ‘War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America’s Colony’ by accomplished journalist Nelson A. Denis. His book sweeps through the many humiliations heaped on Puerto Ricans after the US invasion of , such as a ban on Spanish in schools and a prohibition against the flying of the nation’s flag. Where the American government led, business followed. Suffocating poverty on the island and slave-like conditions on the sugar plantations worsened. The first civilian governor Charles Allen ed to the US and leveraged his contacts and influence to become the King of Sugar. “By ,” writes Denis, “Allen and US banking interests had converted  per cent of all arable land in Puerto Rico into sugar plantations. These bank syndicates also owned the insular postal system, the entire coastal railroad, and the international seaport of San Juan.”Patriots responded with their own Nationalist Party but its ranks were riddled with FBI informers and when that didn’t stymie its growth, supporters were massacred in the town of Ponce. On Sunday March  , a parade of unarmed nationalist cadets was effectively ambushed by police in scenes similar to our own Bloody Sunday. “The police kept shooting and clubbing for thirteen minutes,” says Denis. “By the time they finished,  men, one woman and a seven-year-old girl lay dead over  more were gravely wounded — moaning, crawling, bleeding, and begging for mercy in the street.# marked the high-point of this revolutionary rising when, following  years of military occupation, the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico staged an unsuccessful armed insurrection.They paid a heavy price for tweaking the tale of the tiger. Ill-trained and poorly-equipped cadres of nationalists – branded communists by the powers-that-be – were cut down by US National Guard troops. In the town of Jayuya where revolutionaries had seized control, the residents were subjected to a merciless bombardment by ten Thunderbolt fighter planes armed with -lb bombs. It was the only time in history that the United States bombed its own citizens.Within a fortnight, the rebellion had been quashed but not before a failed assassination attempt on President Truman had ensured the tiny island nation’s freedom struggle made headlines around the world. The nationalists paid a heavy price: vengeful prison sentences were meted out to the leaders and activists. One woman, Blanca Canales, served  years of a le sentence for burning the post office in Jayuya — the same town levelled by US planes. Their incarcerated leader Pedro Albizu Campos was subject to brutal conditions right out of the Gulag Archipelago — and then some. In , he was exposed to radiation poisoning which led to visible burns on his extremities, swelling of his face and led to a stroke which left him paralysed. Thus ended the long struggle of the revolutionary who had parlayed with De Valera and raised money for the Irish liberation movement in Boston in  — at one point he spoke in front of , people in Sanders Theatre in Boston and delivered what was described, by an English lord no less who was present, as “the most complete, the most brilliant speech” on Irish freedom ever heard. The  years which followed his death in  were, says Denis, “a downward spiral of chaos and corruption that turned the island into a punch-drunk fighter, unsure of its whereabouts, wobbling on its feet, pawing at empty air”.It’s hard to argue that things have improved of late. Emigration is the only route to meaningful work for an entire generation: In  alone, it lost a net , residents or nearly . per cent of its population. In , the island went bankrupt with the US Government refusing to come to its aid. In , Puerto Rico was hammered by a Hurricane Maria — the worst natural disaster to ever hit the island. “Is there a solution to all this ” asks Denis. “Of course, but the complicated ones rarely work. Those that have been tried include corporate tax subsidies to giant pharmaceutical companies, a fraudulent war on drugs, government subsidies, austerity programmes, and real estate speculation. These ‘solutions’ breed government fraud, police corruption, absentee ownership, junk bonds, media spin, and rampant hotels, shopping malls and parking lots. The answer may be much simpler. It starts with an honest self-appraisal. It acknowledges the eviction of an entire people — literally and systematically — from their own land.”Nelson Denis has done a service to the people of Puerto Rico — his people — and to the wider world watching on with this authoritative history of a brave island people. He has, at last, put Puerto Rico on the map."},{"url":null,"title":"meet the brexitbashing twitter account followed by leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"mushers twitter thread shows the world how much character her 20 sled","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She is gearing up for the Iditarod race in March, which will see her cross the wilderness of Alaska.To do so she’ll need a team of  capable dogs which she will choose from a squad of  Alaskan huskies – and Twitter is going wild for them.Right now, we have  dogs in training for the Iditarod—and  pups will enter the actual race. Allow me to introduce you to the BraverMountain Varsity Team.— Blair BravermanJanuary , That’s because each dog has a wonderful and unique set of characteristics which make them great company, and Blair has been sharing their stories with the world while she trains on the Denali Highway this winter.Here’s Pepe for example, “our true Lead Dog” according to Blair.. PepéWe have many dogs who can lead the team, but our true Lead Dog — the pup who makes each run happen, who gets us through every storm — is Pepe. Pepe is smarter than all of us. She will run forever and keep running. She is basically everyone’s mother. pic KckFTvvl— Blair BravermanJanuary , The posts have received tens of thousands of likes on Twitter, with social media users falling in love with the group.“The single most important thing for a sled dog is that he or she loves to run,” Blair told the Press Association.“Secondary important traits are a good appetite, a double coat – with a soft downy layer under water-repellent outer hairs – and the ability to get along well as part of a team.“The issue isn’t getting them to run, it’s getting them to stop!”. Flame Flame is my souldog. She is desperately codependent and we are both happiest when we are in physical contact at all times. She is also, to my occasional surprise, a fantastic sled dog. She finished every one of my qualiers with me and never seems to tire. pic JpWVcWxb— Blair BravermanJanuary , Fun fact: If Pepe leads us the  miles to Nome, her own motherwill be waiting for her at the finish line.— Blair BravermanJanuary , Having attended a dogsledding boarding school in Norway when she was , Blair became a dogsled guide in Alaska in the summer, and only got her own dogs four years ago when she moved to northern Wisconsin and began training and racing in earnest.But what does it take for the dogs to fulfil their sledding potential “When we’re raising puppies, the biggest thing we want to teach them is how to be brave,” said Blair.“We take them to dferent places and encourage them to explore and play and have fun, so that they’re exposed to a iety of people, smells, weather, and so on.“After that, our secondary focus is to build confidence in them as athletes. If some young dogs are slower than others, we’ll ide them up into dferent playing and running groups so that no pup feels left behindthey can’t keep up with all their siblings.”And while the dogs must be strong and tough, they come in all shapes and sizes, like Grinch here.. Grinch Grinch has a heart of gold and a brain like a box of rocks. He is extremely strong, maybe our strongest dog, but is easily confused. He loves attention. He loves giving hugs. He has a signicant overbite and his limbs are fitted together like off-brand LEGOs. pic jrmobynt— Blair BravermanJanuary , “A chiropractor once called Grinch a ‘borderline trainwreck” Blair wrote on Twitter, but that hasn’t stopped him being part of the team.Asked which dogs’ characteristics will be crucial to the race, Blair named lead dog Pepe as well as Jenga here, who “thrives on problem-solving”.. Jenga Flame’s half-sister Jenga is a Boss Bitch and she doesn’t suffer fools. She was my first leader and is the only dog mentioned in Ice Cube by name. I feel that Jenga and I understand each other, because we are both fearful creatures prone to fearless decisions. pic lGElLN— Blair BravermanJanuary , Meanwhile, Colbert brings an altogether dferent set of skills.. Colbert Colbert is a big hunk of burning enthusiasm. At checkpoints, when it’s time to start running again, he’s always the first dog on his feet and he barks and jumps until the other dogs stand up. He usually runs in wheel, the position right in front of the sled. pic sRXJyC— Blair BravermanJanuary , “Colbert is everyone’s alarm clock and cheerleader,” said Blair. “He’ll wake me and the dogs up at checkpoints and make sure we keep moving.”Blair has only ever had one dog who didn’t want to work in sledding – that dog now lives with Blair’s mother where she enjoys a le of hiking instead.As for the rest, they’ll enjoy the adventure of a letime with Blair when their race gets under way in March.And that’s everybody in training right now! I can’t wait to keep exploring with these friends. pic sWlUlwNa— Blair BravermanJanuary , “I’ll be all alone and I’m not allowed to accept assistance during the race,” said Blair. “It’ll just be me and  of my dogs, embarking on a big adventure together.”"},{"url":null,"title":"chinese rover begins exploring far side of the moon","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Receiving the MBE is just totally surreal.ldquoIrsquom overwhelmed the work I do in safeguarding children and women has been recognised by the Queen.Sheila started to work as a front line practitioner in the field of social work  years ago. Today, she is Social Work Manager for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust.She is also the chairperson of the South Eastern Area Domestic and Sexual Violence Abuse Partnership, a multi-disciplinary and inter-agency made up of voluntary and statutory community groups like Sure Start, Womenrsquos Aid and PSNI.Sheila said social workers were used to being on the receiving end of unwarranted bad publicity, but were expected by society to protect vulnerable children.She said: ldquoI first began to understand domestic violence when I became a social worker. I quickly realised it was prevalent in a lot of families.ldquoThankfully, society is beginning to talk about it more. ldquoWe need to continue to talk about it because it is so dficult for anyone living with domestic violence to tell their story and it is extremely dficult for children.ldquoThey are scared to speak out because they remain afraid of what might happen to themthey told an outside organisation. Sometimes, their silence is due to them feeling ashamed or even responsible for the abuse they are dealing with.Sheila understood quite early in le about the effects of trauma. Her elder brother, Eugene, disappeared on New Yearrsquos Day  when Sheila was in her early teens.His three children came to live with her family and she saw how her own mother and father were able to make their lives as normal as possible which led to some healing for all of them.The tragedy was the inspiration behind a play called, The Ferryman which debuted in London recently.ldquoMy role is tough, she explains, ldquobut social workers are our own support network. We meet with a lot of anger and abuse. It can be challenging but it can also be rewarding. Many people do come back to us to say thank you or, they will say to us that wersquove helped to turn their le around. That is said to us more frequently than anything . Thatrsquos what keeps us doing the job. We are the source from which change is possible. Everyone has the potential to change and I see it played out time and time again.It is evident that Sheila is dedicated to the families she protects. She said: ldquoDomestic violence is quite prevalent in Northern Ireland. One in six women and one in nine men will live with it including their children some time in their le.ldquoPolice are called to an incident every  minutes. Curiously, it is this time of year that sees a spike in those figures. Christmas Day and New Yearrsquos Day will see the highest numbers of women and children call the police for help.ldquoAnd, I do think the timing of this MBE from the Queen will only serve to raise awareness of this issue. And might even help someone who is suffering abuse to pick up the phone and ask for help.Sheila advises that anyone who wishes to make a call should contact   , which is completely confidential. It is available to all men and women affected by domestic and sexual violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for upgrade at Ardglass harbour  ","story":"THE need for major improvements at Ardglass harbour to allow signicantly larger vessels to enter the port has been highlighted by former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie.Her comments come after last monthrsquos annual EU Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels which determines how much fish can be landed at the local port and at the neighbouring harbours of Kilkeel and Portavogie.EU chiefs have decided to reduce prawn quotas by just over % to ensure the species ldquostays within sustainable levels, while the herring quota has been reduced by %.The Fisheries Council also determines how many days boats can put to sea, but the December meeting will have been the last UK fishermen were represented at ahead of the Brexit at the end of March.Welcoming some of the outcomes from the Brussels negotiations, Miss Ritchie has urged British and Irish governments to resolve what she described as ldquooutstanding problems in the fisheries sector to build the economies at the three Co Down fishing ports.She explained that the Fisheries Council consists of EU Fisheries Ministers who decide on the annual quota allocations for range of species mdash including prawns and white fish mdash which are the main staple of Northern Ireland fishermen.Miss Ritchie said she was concerned there has been a slight decrease in the amount of prawns which can be landed locally, after a series of successive quota increases over recent years.ldquoIt is important that the British Government has realistic proposals capable of implementation in place to safeguard and grow our local industry, said Ms Ritchie.ldquoThere are also other fishing issues that require resolution as they present ongoing challenges to the catching and processing sectors. They include the Voisinage Agreement with the Irish Government to allow Co Down fishermen to resume fishing in Irish Sea waters. There is also the need for improvements to harbour infrastructure at Ardglass and Kilkeel to allow larger boats to land fish.Miss Ritchie said the prawn quota reduction was more to do with the species being exempted from so-called discard ban.She added: ldquoIt is vitally important that our local fishing industry in the catching and processing sectors is allowed to continue to grow and develop.ldquoThe Government needs to continue with a positive working relationship with the industry to allow the economic sectors in Ardglass and Kilkeel to be nurtured to ensure existing jobs are sustained and new employment opportunities are realised.Mr Alan McCulla, chief executive of the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation Sea Source, believes the outcome of the annual negotiation on catch quotas ldquoputs Northern Irelandrsquos fishermen in a good starting position for the next phase in our relationship with the EU.He said the agreements reached at the Fisheries Council meeting offered ldquosome positives and some negatives for the Irish Sea, with the December negotiations described by the Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairsas ldquoone of the most dficult councils in recent years.A spokesperson for the government department said it was vitally important to ensure that sufficient quota was obtained for all Irish Sea fish species to enable them to land all the fish they catch from the start of the New Year, particularly whiting which is a by-catch in the prawn fishery.ldquoThe EU Commission initially proposed an Irish Sea whiting quota of  tonnes but this was successfully negotiated up by % to  tonnes, with agreement to carry out a further review of the quota in the new year.The government department spokesperson said the deal ldquoensures that there are now workable solutions to alleviate the pressure for fishermen while preventing fish from being wastefully discarded unnecessarily..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan tree voted top in NI  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Parkrsquos giant redwood is celebrating being voted Northern Irelandrsquos Tree of the Year in the Woodland Trustrsquos search for the countryrsquos best-loved tree.The stunning redwood mdash or multi-stemmed giant sequoia to be precise mdash finished second in the  UK final.Everyone associated with the Forest Service, the people of Castlewellan and ious groups helping with ambitious regeneration proposals at the stunning forest park, are delighted with the majestic treersquos success in the regional heat.The giant redwood stands within the walled garden at the forest park and at over  years old has seen centuries come and go.

The Hoops raced into a - first half lead with goals from Stephen Galbraithand Sean McMahon before Jordan McCoubrey delivered the coup de grace in the th minute to finally kill off a game Olympic outfit.Celtic looked the more composed and inventive side from the off and an understrength Olympic struggled to create anything of note. The Hoops seized the lead with only six and a half minutes gone and never looked back.Chris Mullan, who was like a fleet-footed gazelle down the left flank and just missed out on the man of the match award, sped past his marker on the edge of the box.His stinging shot that looked destined for the bottom corner of the net was parried out by an alert Ryan Connollly, but Galbraith was hovering around the six-yard box and was perfectly placed to steer the ball home.Less than two minutes later Mullan dipped his shoulder again and cut inside Jack Roddy before striking the base of the post with a fierce shot.Olympic steadfastly refused to buckle and with  minutes gone were unlucky not to equalise when Aaron McCaffrey, their most potent player in attack, was unable to take advantage in a rare moment of panic in the Celtic box.Celtic went back on the attack and with  minutes gone taskmaster Jordan Curran teamed up with Mullan to create an opening for Sean McMahon, but he fired wide.Back at the other end, the dangerous McCaffrey got in behind Conor Doherty, but his delightfully flighted cross missed by everyone in the box.With  minutes gone Rottweiler Curran blocked an Olympic attempt to send Rhys Patterson clear. The ball flew off his shin and into the path of the willing Sean McMahon who raced away from Michael Rice and Darryl Russell, but with only Connolly to beat, his cheeky, dinked effort grazed the crossbar on the way to safety.A minute later another mazy Mullan run ended with the wing wizard crossing for McMahon, but this seasonrsquos top scorer had his audacious effort blocked on the six yard box with Celtic claiming a penalty.The second goal wasnrsquot long in coming and with  minutes gone a Mullan cross was deftly headed home by Doherty, who had been given the freedom of the box. Three minutes later Galbraith made it - when his low corner evaded Connolly at his near post and ended up in the net.Celtic continued their dominance after the break with Mullan and McMahon dovetailing perfectly for Curran, but his shot went well over the top. With  minutes gone McMahon decided to go it alone, but he was well off target as Olympic backed off him.Olympic tried desperately to get things moving, but it just wasnrsquot their day and with  minutes played Russell did exceptionally well to prevent Galbraith from making it - with a last-gasp tackle.The fourth goal was just around the corner and with  minutes gone Andy Baggley headed the ball into the path of prodigy Jordan McCoubrey, who looked suspiciously offside. The teenage terrier didnrsquot hang around as Olympic had pushed up and he raced cleat to beat Connolly all ends up.If anything, Celtic could have won by an even bigger margin and Connolly saved brilliantly in the th minute to deny Baggley a fth Celtic goal.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Shaun Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Mikey Rice, Jordan Curran, Terence Bell, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan.

state Owen Pattersonwith the DUPs David Simpson and Stephen Moutray outside Dan Winters Cottage in Capita had been engaged by The Ulster Society – in which David Trimble was then involved – using public funding for cross-community initiatives in order to explore whether an Orange interpretive centre at the site of Dan Winter’s cottage in Loughgall was a viable proposal.Mr McCavera wrote to Capita to say that he had placed the proposal before a meeting of the CCMS: “The council responded positively to the proposal and could see no objections to Catholic maintained schools participating in programmes associated with the centre.”However, he stressed that it would be for inidual Catholic schools to decide on whether they wanted to visit the centre, rather than the CCMS instructing them to do so.The Ulster Society had applied for a grant in  for an information and educational facility at the site, with a desire to see the site developed in time for , the Order’s bicentenary anniversary.The proposal was for a building which would become both a tourist attraction and an educational facility.But progress was slow, not least because of a dispute over which cottage was the one in which the Orange had been founded and then, after agreement on the correct location, a dispute with the owner over the terms on which it would be sold.A civil service briefing note on the situation said that “progress in purchasing the cottages and adjoining land has been problematic and the Ulster Society has run into objections from both the Planning Service and Roads Service, DOE. “The main obstacle, however, has been a dispute between two branches of the Winter family over ownership of the land for the proposed site of the Diamond Heritage Centre.”In  Dan Winter’s cottage was listed on both historical and architectural grounds and Capita delivered its report.The document stressed the historic signicance of the Orange Order, a body which it said had grown “into a highly influential organisation with an international network ... indeed, a full appreciation of the cultural heritage of Northern Ireland, and a competent and objective understanding of current affairs requires an appreciation of the nature of Orangeism”.“The story of Orangeism at its birth, and in its later evolution, is of intrinsic interest. As an element of the ‘cultural tradition’ of Northern Ireland and as an ingredient in the quest for ‘mutual understanding’ this story has a more practical purpose.”Margaret Ritchie: If the SDLP name disappears I will severely regret it‘Irish feted first baby of  – but won’t applaud first le terminated’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It admitted that “commercial viability of the centre is not possible” but that there were wider economic and social benefits to such a project.The project was to involve refurbishment of the two cottages and the construction of an interpretive building which would house a shop, cafe, toilets, a display space and a video theatre.There would also be car parking, a children’s play area and a model farm and orchard.The consultants concluded that “there exists a potential market for the facility” but that it would cost about £, and would require between , and , visitors a year “to achieve its financial, economic and social impact objectives”.In the end, the project did not go ahead for reasons which are not clear from the file. It was not until  that, thanks to a £, EU and Stormont grant, work began to turn the cottage into a tourist attraction.In , the Order received almost £ million from EU, Stormont and Irish government funding to build museums of Orange heritage at its Schomberg House headquarters in east Belfast and at Sloan’s House in Loughgall.try catch            ..

A referendum in May gave overwhelming support for the measure by .% to .%.As a result, Dublin now provides abortions up to week  of pregnancy, or where there is serious risk to the mother, or where the baby is likely to die shortly after birth.Despite a spate of recent legal challenges, an abortion is currently only lawful in NI where the pregnancy seriously risks a woman’s health.Ms McAvoy said: “On January , the Republic of Ireland celebrated the first baby to be born in . That same day the country’s new legislation on abortion came in to effect. The first human le to be terminated will probably not be celebrated publicly at least.”She added: “We would urge our politicians [in NI] to resist the lobbying from abortion activists and instead provide a more hopeful future for women facing pregnancy crises, a future which is inclusive of them and their children.” Nola Leach, chief executive of the charity Christian Action Research and Education, said the Republic’s new law provides little practical support for women.“It only contains the ‘quick-fix’ of an abortion with little mention of extra funding for support services, counselling, or better provision of information, fostering and adoption for mothers,” she said.There are , people in NI today, she said, who would not be alive had GB legislation been extended here a recent Comres poll found % of people in NI agreed that “both lives matter” in a pregnancy, she added.But Grainne Teggart of Amnesty said the new law and commencement of abortion services are “signicant milestones” in a country which had “one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world”. Amnesty welcomes the fact that women from NI can now access abortion services in the south, she said. However, this serves to underscore “the absurdity of the position women here now find themselves in” because they can board a train or plane for abortions in Dublin or GB but cannot access the same service in NI. “We call on the secretary of state and UK government to ensure  is the year change happens,” she added. with the DUPs David Simpson and Stephen Moutray outside Dan Winters Cottage in \"   with the DUPs David Simpson and Stephen Moutray outside Dan Winters Cottage in \"  Declassied files: CCMS said in  it wasn’t against Catholic schools making Orange Order visitsPSNI deal with multiple cases of blackmail involving men coaxed into performing sex acts Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Alliance for Choice activist, Goretti Horgan, said the vast majority of southern abortions will be through pills prescribed by GPs – medication which she said women on both sides of the border have been using for over a decade.“The change in the south is unlikely to help women here very much,” she said. “We can access abortions in the Republic but would have to pay.” In addition, the three-day ‘cooling off period’ now required to access abortion in the south means an NI woman would have to travel south twice in a week for pills that she could order online in NI without leaving her house.Ex-Sinn Fein TD Pedar Tobin, who is hoping to set up an all-Ireland pro-le political party, lamented the south’s new abortion services.“Leo Varadkar stated this week that the introduction of one of the most extreme abortion regimes in Europe was a sign of social progress,” he told the News Letter. “It shows how upside down our world has become that when the state seeks to end the lives of thousands of inidual human beings it is considered progress.”The majority of women who seek abortions “do so for socio-economic reasons” yet nobody addressed this during the referendum debate, he said. “Shockingly, FF, SF and the SDLP are in lockstep in the promotion of abortion services across Ireland north and south,” he added. Sinn Fein MLA Megan Fearon said: “Sinn Fein supports access to quality and safe abortion care for all women on the island of Ireland.”try catch            ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

The Southern Trust’s Sensory Disability Team identied three children who would benefit from the books and worked with their families to understand the children’s interests.Artist Jill McKeown then worked with the Deaf Club members to produce three bespoke books, one for each child. Jill said: “I found this a very interesting project to work on as we had to consider all aspects of communication. As we were working specically to meet the needs of three inidual children we really wanted their experience to be special and are delighted with the feedback we received. It was lovely to hear the books have given the children such a positive experience.”Eleanor Girvan mum of Nessa said: “The dferent textures and colours and shine really stimulated Nessa and she really enjoyed the book.”Ben Sterritt’s mum Ann added: “The book is amazing and a lot of work has gone into it. Ben loves it – he loves feeling the shapes and texture and enjoys when I read it to him.”And Meadbh Bustard, mother of Cara commented: “Cara loved the sensory aspect of the book touching and feeling it. She loves balloons and numbers and as the book was designed especially with her in mind she really enjoyed it.”Pat McAteer, Specialist Services Manager at the Southern Trust, says: “We have a very active Deaf Club who work together to raise awareness of the needs of and reduce isolation amongst the deaf community. Because of their own communication challenges, our deaf club members have great empathy for this group of visually impaired children and we sincerely thank them for their thoughtfulness in creating such beautul interactive books which are bringing great enjoyment.”The project was funded by the ‘The Northern Ireland Executive Social Investment FundSouthern Zone ‘Work It’ training and employment programme.’Budding young reporters visit BBC Newsline studio Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch            ..

Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34453454454.jpg","title":"supporting belfast start ups on the rise","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business The UK’s digital tech sector has attracted more capital than any other European country and Belfast has established itself as a key hub, writes Roisin Byrne, business director, Hays Northern Ireland The  Tech Nation report makes it clear that digital tech makes an essential contribution to our local economy with clusters and start-ups forming primarily around AI , machine learning, cyber security and big data industries. The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
