Kevin Clinesmith, 36, another FBI attorney who worked on the Clinton investigation, was found to have sent similar messages. Clinesmith was identified as \u0027Attorney 2\u0027 in the inspector general report, but his name was released by Rep. Mark Meadows during a congressional hearing this week.At the hearing, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz declined to confirm the identities of Moyer and Clinesmith. But Meadows said he decided to name them because neither works in a counterintelligence capacity.Clinesmith, who attended Georgetown University Law Center, previously worked for the U.S. Department of Energy before joining the FBI.In 2012, he ran for Advisory Neighborhood Commission in Columbia Heights, a northwest neighborhood in Washington, D.C., on a platform of supporting the local arts, installing more public trash bins to the area, and improving a local dog park.Clinesmith, who is orced, told the New Columbia Heights website at the time that he grew up in a \u0027small farming town in rural Michigan\u0027 and moved to the Washington area in 2008.Clinesmith texted several colleagues bemoaning the \u0027destruction of the Republic\u0027 after FBI Director James Comey wrote a letter informing congress that the Clinton email investigation was being reopened days before the election on October 26, 2016.  Lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page worked both on the Clinton email investigation and on Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u0027s Russia probe they commiserated in 2016 about Trump\u0027s rise to power but decided they could \u0027stop\u0027 him Clinesmith and Moyer are separate, and were not a romantic couple\u0027As I have initiated the destruction of the republic....

He texted an unnamed colleague that he believed the FBI\u0027s decision to reopen the Clinton probe \u0027broke the momentum\u0027 for Clinton.\u0027I am so stressed about what I could have done differently,\u0027 Clinesmith wrote to the unnamed FBI colleague, according to the inspector general report.\u0027It\u0027s just hard not to feel like the FBI caused some of this. It was razor thin in some states,\u0027 he added.The Justice Department inspector general asked Clinesmith during an interview what actions he thought he could have taken to influence the election. Clinesmith said he would have tried to finish the investigation quicker.\u0027It was just kind of like a discussion on how I could have either moved the process along more quickly or more efficiently at a, at a more, at an earlier time, or whatnot,\u0027 he said.Clinesmith also texted that he was \u0027numb\u0027 and \u0027just devastated\u0027 by Trump\u0027s election.\u0027I\u0027m just devastated.

That\u0027s down significantly from a few years ago, and the cost of buying a new car has gone up with the introduction of a value-added tax. Still, car sales are expected to increase between six and 10 percent once women start driving, the chairman of the national committee for cars at the Council of Saudi Chambers told the daily Saudi Gazette.The government recently began allowing women to sell cars as well. Sales jobs had previously been reserved for men in the highly conservative country, where unrelated men and women cannot freely mix.Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia issued its first driver\u0027s licenses to 10 women who already had licenses from other countries. Since then, dozens more have been licensed. None can drive until the ban is officially lifted.          Thousands of women will take the wheel tomorrow as the conservative kingdom tears up its decades-long ruleThe overwhelming majority of women in Saudi Arabia still don\u0027t have licenses. Many haven\u0027t had a chance to take the gender-segregated driving courses that were first offered to women only a few months ago. There\u0027s also a waitlist of several months for a course at Princess Nora University in Riyadh. And the classes can be costly, running several hundred dollars.Others already own cars driven by chauffeurs and are in no rush to drive themselves.\u0027We were princesses ... We were in a good place. Now we\u0027re going to be in a better place,\u0027 said Maram Al-Hazer, a manager at several car showrooms, including Ford, who has two family drivers. \u0027To be honest everyone wants to relax and sit in the backseat and have someone to drive for them.\u0027Though women don\u0027t need a male relative\u0027s approval to get a driver\u0027s license or buy a car, the moral and even financial support of a husband or father is key in this male-dominated society, where men have final say over a woman\u0027s ability to marry, travel abroad or obtain a passport.Nourah Almehaize started selling cars for the first time two months ago, but had already worked for six years in a call center handling queries about vehicles. She\u0027s eager to learn how to drive so she can test-drive the Ford Explorer and Edge she\u0027s been selling to customers, but her husband is telling her to wait.\u0027He is telling me not to (drive right away), to postpone it for a year until we see what it will be like, but I will apply anyways,\u0027 she said. \u0027Currently, I have a driver. After a year I may not need him if I\u0027ve had enough practice and I\u0027m comfortable.\u0027Uzma Chohan, 38, has never driven and relies on a driver or her husband to go places. She prefers to run errands with her husband, which means waiting until he\u0027s back from work in the evening or until the weekend.The couple from Pakistan, who have two boys, has lived in Saudi Arabia for the past 17 years. They\u0027re looking at larger SUVs for the family, but she won\u0027t be driving just yet.\u0027In the beginning years, like to two and three, I\u0027m a little scared about the people. Some naughty guys, you know,\u0027 she said, giggling shyly. \u0027But after two years, after one year, it becomes normal, inshallah (God willing).\u0027Meanwhile, Obeid, who already has a driver\u0027s license from Jordan, plans to obtain a Saudi license when she\u0027s back from traveling abroad this summer.\u0027Me personally, it\u0027s what the car looks like that\u0027s important to me. Then I ask my husband about the specs so he takes a look at it to see what it\u0027s like and if it\u0027s durable,\u0027 she said.Her husband, Mustafa Radwan, is encouraging her to drive and says he\u0027d feel safer knowing that she and their two kids don\u0027t need to rely on ride-hailing services.

The increase in weight misperception in England is alarming and possibly a result of this normalisation.’There has been a rise on the high street in ‘vanity sizing’, where dress sizes are inflated for women with larger waists and hips and bigger busts, to flatter them that they wear a smaller size. Experts say this can ‘undermine’ action to lose weight.The study analysed the Health Survey for England, to find the answers of 23,459 people asked whether they were about the right weight, too heavy or too light.          A study of more than 23,000 people has found more than half of men do not recognise they are overweight or obeseThe results, analysed for five years between 1997 and 2015, show the proportion of overweight men in denial has leapt from 48.4 per cent to 57.9 per cent in that period. At the same time, the proportion of overweight women misjudging their weight has jumped from 24.5 per cent to 30.6 per cent.The study, published in the journal Obesity, says the normalisation of being large has become ‘widespread’ in England, with men most likely to ignore their weight problem.On the Marks \u0026amp Spencer range, Dr Muttarak wrote: ‘By introducing a new design and styling tailored for plus-size customers and using carefully selected fabrics complementing fuller figures, Curve primarily contributes to promoting body positivity.‘While this type of body-positive movement helps reduce stigmatisation of larger-sized bodies, it can potentially undermine the recognition of being overweight and its health consequences.’Among people who were overweight and obese, 38.5 per cent of men and 17.2 per cent of women thought they were ‘about the right weight’. The proportion of obese men misperceiving their weight in 2015 was almost double that seen in 1997.People who underestimated their weight were 85 per cent less likely to try to lose it, with only 51.8 per cent of those who were overweight in the study telling the Health Survey they were trying to shed the pounds.Almost two-thirds of adults in Britain are overweight or obese, with the study focusing on those with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or over, classed as overweight, and of 30 or over, classed as obese.Dr Muttarak, a senior lecturer in UEA’s School of International Development, said: ‘Identifying those prone to misperceiving their weight can help in designing obesity-prevention strategies targeting the specific needs of different groups.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/00/4D89066400000578-0-image-m-12_1529709003139.jpg","title":"Tens thousands pensioners lose 23 000","story":"    David Cameron originally promised to impose a £72,000 cap in 2016.

As did the late glam rocker Alvin Stardust. Actress Dame Penelope Keith and former Tory Cabinet minister Baroness Virginia Bottomley are also long-term residents.Indeed, the celebrity count is so high that one of Thornton\u0027s mayoral predecessors claimed she had to keep a prompt card so as not to forget the names of the area\u0027s countless illustrious residents.Thornton, a key figure in the Godalming Chamber of Commerce and a well-known face in the town even before he entered local politics in 2011, was able to pull the wool over the eyes of his fellow \u0027Godhelmians\u0027 for years.His prize-winning \u0027Godalming Sausages\u0027 were much sought after. As well as being elected Mayor by fellow town councillors in May last year, he was also, until his dramatic fall from grace, a Tory borough councillor.Sickeningly, as the Mail discovered this week, Thornton was even responsible for helping to draw up a new policy for safeguarding children for Waverley Borough Council in 2014 when he was grandly \u0027portfolio holder for children and young people\u0027.          Former town mayor Simon Thornton arriving at Guildford Crown Court with his new partner before being jailed for nine years for child abuse Certainly, no one suspected the charming, personable chap, who turned up in flamboyant suits and his smart gold chains of office to visit art exhibitions, judge community competitions or to launch the \u0027Dogalming\u0027 dog show, was hiding an evil past. Not even his first wife, a nursery nurse at a private prep school, appears to have realised the truth of what was going on, despite the fact that on occasions the teenage girl slept at their house — even in the marital bed.This, it was said in court, was all part of Thornton\u0027s deceitful scheme to \u0027normalise\u0027 his wicked behaviour among those around him.The first Mrs Thornton, who is 12 years younger than her ex-husband and was 20 when she married him in 2005, told friends she believed Thornton was simply being kind to the troubled girl.For legal reasons it is impossible go into precise details of Thornton\u0027s relationship with his teenage victim who is now a woman in her mid-20s.But in court it emerged that she was particularly vulnerable to his advances because of her own family life.In a statement she described how at the time she was desperate to get away from her childhood home.She believed that she loved Thornton and said that it was only after confiding in a school friend that she realised that his behaviour was wrong.

Homes in Godalming are so desirable that it was once dubbed \u0027Celebrity Central\u0027\u0027Since then I have lacked self-respect for myself which has caused me to make poor decisions,\u0027 she said. \u0027I was forced to grow up too quickly and I have suffered depression.\u0027And yet for years she didn\u0027t tell on him — not until he appalled her by trying to reminisce about their \u0027relationship\u0027 with her when they met as adults by showing her a sex film he had made of them. She went to the police and he was arrested last October.By then, Thornton and his first wife had orced and he had remarried. After his arrest he telephoned his second wife from the police station and confessed his crime.Incredibly, the new Mrs Thornton has stood by him throughout, travelling to Guildford Crown Court with him in May for a plea and directions hearing and on Monday for his sentencing.Although she stopped short of entering the court room, as if she couldn\u0027t bear to hear the truth about her husband of just 18months. Perhaps she was swayed by the argument his defence team gave in court when they tried to mitigate his crimes by claiming Thornton\u0027s own childhood had been similarly miserable.Diagnosed with dyslexia, they said, he had attended a \u0027remedial school\u0027.For anyone who knows anything about Thornton\u0027s upbringing, it was a desperate argument indeed.Mr Thornton is the second youngest son of a middle-class family, who are well respected members of their community.As a child, it is understood, Thornton was often in trouble, with his parents putting his difficulties, in and out of school, down to his severe dyslexia.Aged 14, he got a part-time job working in a butcher\u0027s shop belonging to one of their neighbours.After leaving school at 16, Thornton began working there full-time. In 2000, when the owner retired, he bought the business from him, renaming the premises.Since then, Godalming Butchers has become one of the most high-profile food shops in town, thanks in part to Thornton\u0027s friendly, chatty personality. His artisanal sausages beat off competition from a local branch of Waitrose and a rival butcher to win a trophy in 2011.And yet what might have been regarded as a personal success story was tarnished by the less appealing aspects of his personality.He was, say locals who know him, overly competitive, especially when it came to buying — and driving — cars. His latest was a Porsche.Perhaps most tellingly of all — both his wives were considerably younger than him. His first marriage was said to have broken up because of his suspicious, controlling behaviour.It\u0027s hard to believe this is the man who was able to help shape Waverley Borough Council\u0027s Child safeguarding policy in 2014.W riting in the document\u0027s preface he said: \u0027Through our work as councillors, staff and contractors, we all come across children and their families.\u0027Occasionally we might see something that concerns us, and may worry that a child is at risk of being abused, harmed, neglected or exploited.\u0027Where this is the case, Waverley expects councillors, staff and contractors to act responsibly and report their concerns to the relevant part of Surrey County Council.\u0027He added: \u0027By taking action you could save a life.\u0027Council leader Julia Potts said in a statement: \u0027On behalf of everyone at Waverley Borough Council and Godalming Town Council we are all appalled by this news.\u0027My thoughts at this time are with the victim. It is clear that none of the crimes were committed during his time as a councillor.\u0027From the moment we were made aware of the investigation, both councils have been fully cooperative and supportive of the police and their enquiries.\u0027The two councils of which Thornton was a member — Godalming and Waverley — sit next door to each other in the heart of the town. Inside the early 20th century Borough Hall, Thornton sat beneath a portrait of the Queen and joined in the prayers that marked the start of each council meeting.In Godalming\u0027s historic High Street this week, several shoppers could be overheard discussing the case.One elderly man, standing just yards from Thornton\u0027s shop and the old-fashioned decorative Victorian bicycle still parked outside, called to two well-dressed ladies: \u0027Did you hear about our butcher?\u0027A sign outside his shop reads: \u0027As of 1st June The Godalming Butchers is under new ownership\u0027.Despite the heinous nature of his crimes, some of the townspeople still appear to be in forgiving mood.\u0027He\u0027s a very nice man. He made a stupid mistake. He wouldn\u0027t do that now. I\u0027ll stay in touch with him,\u0027 said one shop assistant.Another added: \u0027It\u0027s difficult. He was basically a nice man but you do not really know what goes on in people\u0027s private lives.\u0027When he was arrested last October, Thornton quietly resigned, citing \u0027personal reasons\u0027. Now that the truth has come out, the downfall of the Mayor of Godalming is, not surprisingly, the talk of the town.Additional reporting by Stephanie Condron "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/22/23/4D85C7E100000578-0-image-m-35_1529705386333.jpg","title":"One England watch England Panama World Cup game Sunday good weather","story":"    England will be cheered on by more than 20million armchair TV viewers and lunchtime pub drinkers in the biggest football match the nation has seen for yearsEngland are 1-5 favourites to beat Panama, who are making their first World Cup appearance after eliminating the United States.

Panama is the only country where you can see the sun rise over the Pacific Ocean and set on the Atlantic TANGLED HISTORYThe official language is Spanish, so it’s unlikely many of the England lads will be chipping in with the penalty box banter. Spain colonised the country in the 16th century, but it broke away in 1821. Then it gets complicated. It joined a union of nations known as the Republic of Gran Colombia. This was dissolved in 1831, with Panama and Colombia becoming the Republic of New Granada and later Colombia. Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903.A SQUAD OF OLDIESSo have we got a chance? Put it this way, Panama have never qualified for a World Cup before – and they aren’t very good. Only footie anoraks will have heard of any of their players, and whereas England has one of the youngest squads in the tournament, Panama’s is ancient by comparison. Centre forward Blas Perez (who has played for 19 clubs over 20 years) is 37, and the chap who comes on for him is 36.          Panama have never qualified for a World Cup before, making this year a first WONDER OF THE WORLDTheir canal makes ours look like trickles of water. The 48-mile Panama Canal – considered by some to be one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World – connects the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, saving ships 7,800 miles by avoiding Cape Horn. Completed in 1914, it generates one third of Panama’s economy through tolls.NATTY HEADWEAR So do the players wear panama hats before the match? No, since they are not actually made in Panama. They originated in Ecuador and their history goes back to the Incas. They may have got their name because they were often transported along the canal. During the American-Spanish war (1898), the US government ordered 50,000 of them for troops heading for the Caribbean. The British upper classes adopted them as fashionable summer hats.A DUBIOUS BOSS Panama boss Hernan Dario Gomez once attacked an unidentified woman, hitting her at least four times at a pub in Bogota when he was manager of Colombia. Understandably he was forced to resign. He later took his native country to the 1998 World Cup before becoming manager of Ecuador, which also reached the finals in 2002. Both countries were eliminated at the group stage.          Panama boss Hernan Dario Gomez (pictured) once attacked an unidentified womanTAX SCANDALThe so-called Panama Papers were 11.5 million leaked documents that identified offshore companies. The leak (from a law firm in Panama) in 2015 revealed widespread tax avoidance among the political elite. World leaders implicated included Russian president Vladimir Putin and the prime ministers of Pakistan and Iceland. Also named was Ian Cameron, father of David, who ran an offshore investment fund, and Argentina’s World Cup star Lionel Messi.GREEN CHICKEN BROTHThe national dish is sancocho, a chicken broth flavoured with the central American herb culantro, which gives it a greenish colour. It is served with rice and a bottle of hot sauce on the side. Some people believe it works wonders for a hangover, so perhaps the England team should have some to hand if they win again.POCKMARKED DESPOTPanama’s most notorious politician was the pockmarked Manuel Noriega, the army officer who ruled as dictator from 1983 until 1989. He was overthrown by an American invasion, but holed himself up in the Vatican’s embassy in Panama City. On Christmas Day he endured ‘music torture’ when the US army blasted him with punk and heavy metal. Sensibly, he surrendered after ten days.CANOE FRAUDSTERSA British man, John Darwin, faked his death in a canoe accident near Hartlepool in 2002 to claim £25,000 in insurance, but then resurfaced in Panama five years later. He and his wife Anne planned to open a hotel specialising in canoeing holidays. Their scam came to an end after Panama’s visa laws were tightened. Darwin returned to the UK and walked into a police station, claiming to have no memory of the past five years. Both were convicted of fraud and sentenced to more than six years in prison – very much up the creek without a paddle.

Kevin Clinesmith, 36, another FBI attorney who worked on the Clinton investigation, was found to have sent similar messages. Clinesmith was identified as \u0027Attorney 2\u0027 in the inspector general report, but his name was released by Rep. Mark Meadows during a congressional hearing this week.At the hearing, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz declined to confirm the identities of Moyer and Clinesmith. But Meadows said he decided to name them because neither works in a counterintelligence capacity.Clinesmith, who attended Georgetown University Law Center, previously worked for the U.S. Department of Energy before joining the FBI.In 2012, he ran for Advisory Neighborhood Commission in Columbia Heights, a northwest neighborhood in Washington, D.C., on a platform of supporting the local arts, installing more public trash bins to the area, and improving a local dog park.Clinesmith, who is orced, told the New Columbia Heights website at the time that he grew up in a \u0027small farming town in rural Michigan\u0027 and moved to the Washington area in 2008.Clinesmith texted several colleagues bemoaning the \u0027destruction of the Republic\u0027 after FBI Director James Comey wrote a letter informing congress that the Clinton email investigation was being reopened days before the election on October 26, 2016.

He texted an unnamed colleague that he believed the FBI\u0027s decision to reopen the Clinton probe \u0027broke the momentum\u0027 for Clinton.\u0027I am so stressed about what I could have done differently,\u0027 Clinesmith wrote to the unnamed FBI colleague, according to the inspector general report.\u0027It\u0027s just hard not to feel like the FBI caused some of this. It was razor thin in some states,\u0027 he added.The Justice Department inspector general asked Clinesmith during an interview what actions he thought he could have taken to influence the election. Clinesmith said he would have tried to finish the investigation quicker.\u0027It was just kind of like a discussion on how I could have either moved the process along more quickly or more efficiently at a, at a more, at an earlier time, or whatnot,\u0027 he said.Clinesmith also texted that he was \u0027numb\u0027 and \u0027just devastated\u0027 by Trump\u0027s election.\u0027I\u0027m just devastated.

Panama is the only country where you can see the sun rise over the Pacific Ocean and set on the Atlantic TANGLED HISTORYThe official language is Spanish, so it’s unlikely many of the England lads will be chipping in with the penalty box banter. Spain colonised the country in the 16th century, but it broke away in 1821. Then it gets complicated. It joined a union of nations known as the Republic of Gran Colombia. This was dissolved in 1831, with Panama and Colombia becoming the Republic of New Granada and later Colombia. Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903.A SQUAD OF OLDIESSo have we got a chance? Put it this way, Panama have never qualified for a World Cup before – and they aren’t very good. Only footie anoraks will have heard of any of their players, and whereas England has one of the youngest squads in the tournament, Panama’s is ancient by comparison. Centre forward Blas Perez (who has played for 19 clubs over 20 years) is 37, and the chap who comes on for him is 36.

The 48-mile Panama Canal – considered by some to be one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World – connects the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, saving ships 7,800 miles by avoiding Cape Horn. Completed in 1914, it generates one third of Panama’s economy through tolls.NATTY HEADWEAR So do the players wear panama hats before the match? No, since they are not actually made in Panama. They originated in Ecuador and their history goes back to the Incas. They may have got their name because they were often transported along the canal. During the American-Spanish war (1898), the US government ordered 50,000 of them for troops heading for the Caribbean. The British upper classes adopted them as fashionable summer hats.A DUBIOUS BOSS Panama boss Hernan Dario Gomez once attacked an unidentified woman, hitting her at least four times at a pub in Bogota when he was manager of Colombia. Understandably he was forced to resign. He later took his native country to the 1998 World Cup before becoming manager of Ecuador, which also reached the finals in 2002. Both countries were eliminated at the group stage.          Panama boss Hernan Dario Gomez (pictured) once attacked an unidentified womanTAX SCANDALThe so-called Panama Papers were 11.5 million leaked documents that identified offshore companies. The leak (from a law firm in Panama) in 2015 revealed widespread tax avoidance among the political elite. World leaders implicated included Russian president Vladimir Putin and the prime ministers of Pakistan and Iceland. Also named was Ian Cameron, father of David, who ran an offshore investment fund, and Argentina’s World Cup star Lionel Messi.GREEN CHICKEN BROTHThe national dish is sancocho, a chicken broth flavoured with the central American herb culantro, which gives it a greenish colour. It is served with rice and a bottle of hot sauce on the side. Some people believe it works wonders for a hangover, so perhaps the England team should have some to hand if they win again.POCKMARKED DESPOTPanama’s most notorious politician was the pockmarked Manuel Noriega, the army officer who ruled as dictator from 1983 until 1989. He was overthrown by an American invasion, but holed himself up in the Vatican’s embassy in Panama City. On Christmas Day he endured ‘music torture’ when the US army blasted him with punk and heavy metal. Sensibly, he surrendered after ten days.CANOE FRAUDSTERSA British man, John Darwin, faked his death in a canoe accident near Hartlepool in 2002 to claim £25,000 in insurance, but then resurfaced in Panama five years later. He and his wife Anne planned to open a hotel specialising in canoeing holidays. Their scam came to an end after Panama’s visa laws were tightened. Darwin returned to the UK and walked into a police station, claiming to have no memory of the past five years. Both were convicted of fraud and sentenced to more than six years in prison – very much up the creek without a paddle.

His prognosis is “dire”, doctors said, and he is not expected to live more than a few weeks or months. Previously, the Australian Border Force (ABF) and Department of Home Affairs had been adamant he would not be moved to Australia under any circumstances.But the  has learned that he was flown by air ambulance from Nauru to Brisbane on Saturday afternoon. He was due to land at 6:45pm local time, Hazara community members on Nauru have said. first publicly revealed Ali’s case last month, after doctors and members of the Afghan Hazara community on Nauru pleaded with the ABF for him to be moved.There are no specialist palliative care facilities on Nauru, and Ali, as his health deteriorates, is increasingly in need of care and pain relief beyond that available to him on the island. The care he is receiving inside the Australian-run regional processing centre is “totally inadequate”, doctors say. The ABF had previously told Ali he could go to Taiwan to die – an option he has rejected because he does not know anybody there, was concerned there would be no one to translate his language, Hazaraghi, and that there would be no one to perform the Shia Muslim rituals and ceremonies on his body when he died.The ABF also offered him $25,000 to return to Afghanistan, the country he fled after facing threats on his life. Ali is a member of the persecuted Hazara minority and has been formally recognised as a refugee – he faces a well-founded fear of persecution in Afghanistan and cannot be forcibly returned there. Australia is legally obliged to protect him.For several weeks, Ali’s treatment has been the subject of fierce debate within the ABF and home affairs department.Sources told the  several ABF and departmental officials argued strongly for Ali to be brought to Australia, saying the country was failing a “fundamental legal and moral duty of care” by leaving him on Nauru, and that to move a dying man to a place that could properly care for him at the end of his life caused no substantial damage to Australia’s resolute offshoring policy.High-profile or politically-sensitive medical cases are decided not by the ABF but by executive-level officials of the Department of Home Affairs in some cases as high as the secretary of the department or the minister for home affairs.ABF recommendations from Nauru are often overruled at the executive level inside the department.As late as Saturday morning, home affairs minister Peter Dutton was quoted as saying, in response to pressure to close the Manus and Nauru offshore detention centres: “it’s not time to take our foot off the throat of this threat”.“It’s essential that people ­realise that the hard-won success of the last few years could be undone overnight by a single act of compassion in bringing 20 people from Manus to Australia,” Dutton told the Weekend Australian.After Ali’s situation was revealed in the , the Australian Medical Association and Royal Australasian College of Physicians issued statements insisting he be moved immediately to Australia where he could be properly cared for.“This man should be brought to Australia for palliative care and be allowed dignity and respect at the end of his life,” the RACP president, associate professor Mark Lane, said.Nearly 24,000 people have signed a change.org petition calling for Ali to be immediately brought to Australia. And an online open letter started by the Sydney GP Sara Townend garnered more than 2,000 signatures from doctors across the country, including former heads of the AMA, and those who had worked on Nauru. The letter said Ali’s current situation was “no way to die”.Townend told  Australia: “It hurt so much to read of this man’s situation because I work so hard for my own patients to make their deaths the best they can be.“I work with adults who are dying, and with children who are dying. Even here in Australia with excellent palliative care available, a good death is challenging to achieve. I could not bear to think of this man dying alone in a room without family or community or appropriate medical expertise. I could not believe this was a deliberate act of exclusion by my government.”Friends on Nauru say that condition of Ali – who had previously worked in construction while being held on the island – has deteriorated badly in recent weeks. He is finding it increasingly difficult to speak, has lost most of the use of his right arm, and can no longer dress himself.*Ali is a patronym his full name is withheld to protect his family."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06481cc05ed80377ae3f455f5ba5e526d09fc831/0_44_1790_1074/master/1790.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95bbaecff2af2e027dabf36b03aee184","title":"poo power is it time to embrace our waste as a source of renewable energy","story":"Whether it’s being used to fuel the local bus, or help tackle social challenges around the world, the value of human sewage could be greater than you thinkPoo: not the most glamorous topic, is it? Aside from the occasional bit of scatological humour (scatology being the study of faeces … delightful), most of us happily steer away from regularly talking about it, for fairly obvious reasons.But, if you push past the initial icky revulsion of talking about human waste, you’d find out that it actually contains a vast amount of potential value in terms of energy, providing a sustainable form of fuel that we could all help supply.In 2015, research by the United Nations University found that human waste was a potential fuel source and if all of it was collected worldwide, annually it would be “great enough in theory to generate electricity for up to 138m households” – which is all of Indonesia, Brazil, and Ethiopia combined. An equivalent amount of natural gas would cost $9.5bn (£6.7bn).Poo-powered innovations are already happening, too. Earlier this year, a Worcestershire man made headlines when, fed-up with seeing bags littered across the scenic Malvern Hills, he designed a street lamp that runs on dog poo – two hours of light for every 10 bags of poo.There are companies across the UK that are also starting to explore the potential of poo power on a larger scale. Bristol-based renewable energy company GENeco is using sewage waste from the city to create green gas, which is then supplied to homes across the UK by Bristol Energy.“When sewage waste arrives at GENeco’s treatment plant in Bristol, it is treated and turned into what’s called ‘sludge’,” explains Bristol Energy renewables and origination manager Simon Proctor. “This forms the raw fuel for the anaerobic digestion plant.”During anaerobic digestion, organic matter – in this case, the sewage sludge – is broken down by microorganisms in an airtight container Proctor compares it to “the way a cow’s stomach breaks down grass”.This process produces methane-rich biogas, which is treated to remove impurities and ensure emissions are odour-free. The enriched biomethane is then injected into the gas distribution network. “It has the same quality as natural gas, and can be used in our homes as an alternative to fossil fuels,” Proctor says.The results are impressive. According to Bristol Energy, an average household’s weekly flushes could produce enough biomethane to cook a fry-up two weeks’ flushes could cook a roast dinner and annual flushes from every household in Bristol could fry 83m eggs.Biomethane was also used as fuel by GENeco to run a “Bio-Bus” shuttle to and from Bath and Bristol airport and also on a regular bus service within Bristol, aptly named the “number two route”. The bus travelled more than 180 miles on a tank of gas produced by the annual food and sewage waste of just five passengers.Sustainability is at the heart of the entire process. “Producing biomethane from sewage waste means that we don’t have to use fossil fuels,” Proctor says. “Burning fossil fuels is one of the biggest sources of CO2 emissions in the UK. Switching the average UK home to renewable energy can save more than 1.5 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year, that’s equivalent to taking a car off the road for six months.”He also points out that while we can try to reduce other forms of waste, such as packaging, plastic or food, reducing the level of sewage waste “is obviously going to be more difficult” – making the process an important step towards a more sustainable world.Bristol Energy will also invest its profits back into the city, creating what Proctor calls a “circular economy”. “Sewage waste from Bristol is recycled into green gas our customers switch to a locally owned company and save money – and then our profits will go back into the local community,” he says.That doesn’t mean there aren’t drawbacks, however, particularly in terms of the adoption of the process. Installation and maintenance costs for anaerobic digestion systems can be high, and many companies have been forced to rely on government initiatives to keep running. Proctor says that support under such schemes has been “very ambiguous at times”, which could be, in part, what is preventing more companies from adopting similar systems.Prof Chris Metcalfe, director of the Institute for Watershed Science at Trent University in Canada, worked on the UN study into human waste. He believes that biogas should be considered a resource not only for energy production, but also as compost “for improving agricultural productivity” and for the recycling of water for irrigation.“In most cases, we’re wasting this resource by either putting the solids into landfill or by discharging the liquid sewage into lakes and rivers,” he says.The main issue, Metcalfe believes, is not the technology – in fact, he says there are no real technological barriers to the use of human waste as fuel. Instead, it’s “people’s attitudes about using human waste” that causes problems. “In many countries, the idea of collecting and using human waste is not culturally acceptable, even though animal manure is often used for biogas production,” Metcalfe explains.But Proctor says human waste is already being used more widely than we may think. This is evident across the world, where the process is increasingly being used to improve sanitation in developing countries. In India, where $20bn (around £14bn) of government funding has recently been put towards building sanitary toilets, social project SHRI (Sanitation and Health Rights India) uses an anaerobic biodisgestion system to provide electricity to pump ground water that is later filtered and sold, with profits paying for the ongoing maintenance of the toilets.It may not be glamorous, sexy or particularly futuristic it may still seem slightly icky. But it’s undeniable: whether it’s being used to fuel cars, buses or homes in the UK, or to improve sanitation conditions across the world, poo has the power to change lives.To find out more about how you can support green energy and save money on your bills, visit bristol-energy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0e994c6b4aced4b04e880aa4bbc6c8686b8a259/0_108_3240_1944/master/3240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abfa598e65617fadd7e44a08aab7a6f6","title":"bourbon levis prices rise eu enforces tariffs us","story":"Bourbon whiskey, Levi’s and Harley-Davidson on list as EU measures comes into forceDonald Trump has threatened to widen the mounting trade dispute between US and the EU by imposing tariffs on European cars, after Brussels made good on its threat of retaliatory levies on American products including bourbon whiskey, Levi’s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes. Trump’s new threat comes after the EU imposed tariffs on a range of US consumer goods in response to steel and aluminium tariffs from the White House, which could increase the cost of consumer goods by £200m per year in the UK alone.Should Trump carry through the levy, it would have damaging consequences for jobs and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic. Leaders from American and European car manufacturers have previously said such measures would lead to net job losses in the US.Shares in US and European carmakers fell, including Ford, General Motors, Fiat, BMW and Daimler.The US opened a new front in the trade war on Friday, telling the World Trade Organisation that appeals rulings in trade disputes could be vetoed if they took longer than the allowed 90 days. The statement by the US ambassador, Dennis Shea, threatened to erode a key element of trade enforcement at the 23-year-old WTO: binding dispute settlement, which is widely seen as a major bulwark against protectionism.The tariffs from Brussels imposed on consumer goods – designed to target producers in Republican states where Trump draws much of his support – were introduced from 11pm (BST) on Thursday on US goods worth up to €2.8bn (£2.5bn).The White House had refused to exempt its traditional allies from worldwide tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump argues are necessary to protect US jobs and industry. The president is also threatening China with tariffs worth up to $200bn over alleged “unfair” trading practices.The EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmström, said this week the 28-nation bloc was left with no other choice but to impose tariffs of its own after the “unilateral and unjustified decision of the US”. Although American goods already in the UK will not increase in price, shipments leaving the US for Europe from Friday onwards will be charged the tariffs. Customs agents across the EU internal market of 500 million people will impose the duty, hiking prices on US-made products in supermarkets and across factory floors.The EU tax on imported goods in the UK will be collected by HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs, with some of those duties staying within the country, but the cost for importers, such as wholesale firms and supermarkets, will rise and is likely to be passed on to consumers.Richard Lim, the chief executive of the consultancy Retail Economics, estimated the tariffs could add £200m to the cost of consumer goods in Britain. In 2017, consumers in the UK spent about £406bn on retail purchases.“Though the immediate effects on UK retailers might look relatively modest, it is worth paying close attention to this dispute because it’s future course is unpredictable, fast moving and could quickly escalate to engulf other, seemingly unrelated areas of trade,” he said.Most economists say the consequence of higher international import tariffs will drive up costs for consumers, offsetting much of the benefit of protecting domestic industries for the country imposing them.European consumers would be able to find alternatives, said the European commission vice-president for trade, Jyrki Katainen. “If we chose products like Harley-Davidson, peanut butter and bourbon, it’s because there are alternatives on the market. We don’t want to do anything that would harm consumers,” he said. “What’s more, these products will have a strong symbolic political impact.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef466f132d79cc5354f26880d6d458633f8423cf/0_33_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8ffe7247290a7c7570e7aea240f577f","title":"airbus brexit britain commonwealth plane wings north wales","story":"Forget Brexiteer fantasies: where in the Commonwealth will Liam Fox find buyers for plane wings made in north Wales? • Airbus plans UK job cuts amid fears of hard BrexitA few days ago, I wrote about how big businesses were no longer just frustrated with Theresa May and her Brexit bumblings. Instead, they were turning hostile. “Soon the headlines will be not just about a few hundred jobs moving out of the City – but of firms scrapping their expansion plans, or factories shifting to Poland, or thousands of jobs going at a stroke of a pen.”Today’s announcement from Airbus is just the first of those body blows to the British economy. The aeroplane-making giant has said in public what it has been telling ministers and officials in private for months: if May’s government crashes out of the EU without a deal, it will be forced to “reconsider its footprint in the country, its investments in the UK and its dependency on the UK”. Even an “orderly” Brexit, with all ducks in a carefully negotiated row, will cost the multinational billions in red tape and slower operations.At Broughton in north Wales, they’ve been making planes since world war two. Under Airbus, that plant teems with 6,000 staff, in an area that 40 years ago was pretty much stripped of its steel industry. If it loses that giant factory, the local economy will be back on the floor for decades.Some will doubtless point out the irony of the leave voters of north Wales now paying for their votes with their jobs. That is to ignore how many Airbus workers will be commuting into Broughton from around Liverpool. The potential ripples of this will spread far and wide, and they will last.After Margaret Thatcher delivered the mortal blow to British industry in the 1980s, she devastated those communities – and helped sow the seeds of the Brexit vote of 2016. We are once again back at the stage where decisions made in smart offices by company executives threaten economic and social collapse in areas that can still remember their last great economic disaster – and once again the political consequences are likely to remain with us for a long time to come.Of course, the government knows all this, because it produced an analysis of Brexit’s impact on aerospace as one of its 39 secret reports. These were the ones that were only made public after weeks of wrangling and published just days before Christmas.I went back this morning and looked at what clues the report contained for the fallout for Britain’s aviation industry. Aircraft, it solemnly declares, have “nose, fuselage, wings … and tail”. I looked up mention of Airbus. Like Boeing, the report says, Airbus has “the capability to design and manufacture large, civil passenger aircraft”. In other words, the aeroplane-maker makes planes. And so it rambles on for 19 pages. To call it a Wikipedia rip-off would be too kind, since the online encyclopedia costs the taxpayer nothing. Yet it’s what you might expect from a government that has always treated Brexit as more a matter of internal party discipline and less a real-world event with an actual hard deadline.This is not purely a Brexit story. It is also a reflection of the weakness of Britain’s economic model.What the Airbus story reveals again is that our political classes – from Holyrood to Westminster to Cardiff Bay – have made themselves supplicants for foreign investment. The result is that among all the 28 members of the EU, the UK comes second only to Ireland in its reliance on foreign-direct investment. Just like Dublin and its sweetheart deals for the likes of Apple, we have bribed our way into that position.Even while George Osborne was hacking back benefits for the working poor, he also brought down corporation tax to among the lowest in the world. The rationale was that this would make Britain more “competitive” and boost investment. Yet that policy was described this morning by his former adviser Lord Jim O’Neill as a comprehensive failure: “Investment spending has been very weak absolutely and relatively to many other countries. Despite this remarkable drop in ongoing corporation tax and rising profitability … it’s not done the job it’s supposed to do.”Not only that, we have handed billions to companies in order to get them to set up base here. Look at the Corporate Welfare Watch database, set up by Kevin Farnsworth at the University of York, and you can see that the Welsh government handed Airbus nearly £15m in direct grants between 2004 and 2007.Like Mexico, we are effectively a branch-plant economy for the rest of the world: we import components from other countries, then ships off parts to the continent or China or the US for them to be made into whole products. Trade secretary Liam Fox can jaw on about striking new trade deals, but he’ll be waiting a long time to find a buyer in Wellington or Canberra for the plane wings made in Broughton. And Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour can fret over not hurting the feelings of its leave-voting constituents, but it would be better off developing an industrial strategy that privileged local businesses and the everyday economy.Brexit Britain is a precarious business model coupled with throwback fantasies about buccaneering our way around the Commonwealth. It makes us easy prey for the likes of Airbus, which although profitable in this country has been exploring its options in Korea and elsewhere for a long time. Why would a European plane-maker cut jobs in France or Germany when it needs EU support against Donald Trump and Boeing? Far easier to cut back in Britain, with its cabinet at war, its economy drifting away from the European mainland, and its jar of corporate sweeties already heavily raided. In lots of other industries, lots of other companies will soon be arriving at the same conclusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bb86ec3f6d00894cf506e7817f3436735701903/0_338_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f475b324874c969b1f64d41ab8fea9cd","title":"erdogan turkey elections middle east syria","story":"The prospect of a triumphantly re-elected Recep Tayyip Erdoğan armed with sweeping new presidential powers is deeply alarming to many Turks, but it is also a scary prospect for the international community. Since taking national office 15 years ago, Erdoğan has turned from neighbourhood bully-boy into geostrategic threat. Under his choleric, resentful tutelage, Turkey has ceased to be a reliable friend of Europe and the US. If he gets his way in Sunday’s polls, Erdoğan, a dictator in all but name, is likely to foment further instability in Syria and throughout the Middle East region.Latest estimates suggest Erdoğan, who is facing stronger than expected opposition, will be forced into a second round run-off in July. Likewise, his neo-Islamist Justice and Development party, in power since 2002 and accused of economic mismanagement and corruption, may lose its overall parliamentary majority.Few observers believe Erdoğan will ultimately be denied the presidential palace. Despite his egregious abuses of civil and human rights, the mass arrests that followed the failed 2016 coup, and his contempt for Turkey’s secular democratic institutions, including independent media, Istanbul’s former mayor remains a potent force.Erdoğan’s personalised politics, underpinned by support from nationalists, observant Sunni Muslims and rural conservatives, and sustained by deliberately isive, populist policies, represent a big challenge for foreign partners.Ahmet Davutoğlu, an amiable professor who was Erdoğan’s chief adviser, foreign minister and prime minister from 2003 to 2016, helped promulgate a “zero problems with neighbours” foreign policy that initially brought positive regional advances. So-called “neo-Ottomanism” was, briefly, all the rage.But as Davutoğlu’s influence faded, Erdoğan – always quick to imagine a slight or find a grievance – reversed course. Relations with Egypt, a key Arab power, are a case in point. Erdoğan’s ambition to be a leader for the entire Muslim world climaxed in September 2011 when he visited Cairo shortly after the Arab spring revolt that toppled Hosni Mubarak. He was feted as a hero.Erdoğan is still bent on creating a new Ottoman sultanate. But his idea is a far cry from the benign construct envisaged by Davutoğlu. On the contrary, it thrives on problems with neighbours. The rift with Cairo endures. And Erdoğan has also fallen out with the Gulf monarchies over continuing links to the Muslim Brotherhood, Ankara’s perceived military ambitions, and its de facto alliances with Iran and Qatar. Prince Salman, the Saudi crown prince, says Turkey is part of a “triangle of evil” that includes Iran and Islamic extremists.As a politician feeding on friction and strife, such isions are grist to Erdoğan’s mill. By creating notional national enemies, he wins votes, or at least he thinks he does. Thus the current election campaign has seen escalating Turkish military operations inside northern Iraq, on the Kandil mountains border with Iran, where the outlawed Kurdish group the PKK is based. Neither Tehran nor Baghdad has given permission for these dangerous armed encroachments – but, in his hubris and arrogance, Erdoğan does not care.According to the Turkish army, dozens of PKK militants were “neutralised” in Iraq and south-east Turkey this week alone. Such random violence is entirely typical of Erdoğan’s crude overall approach to the “Kurdish problem”, which he in any case claims, preposterously, to have solved. Kurdish civilians bear the brunt of his failure. Pro-Kurdish politicians, such as his presidential rival, Selahattin Demirtaş, campaigning from behind bars, end up in jail – or worse.Erdoğan’s Kurdish obsession is exacerbating conflict along the Syria-Turkey border, too. The decision earlier this year to invade Afrin, in north-west Syria, was dictated by his wish to repulse pro-western Syrian Kurdish forces, not to help US and allied fighters combat Islamic State or assist anti-Assad rebels.To avert a military clash between US and Turkish forces around Manbij, the Trump administration shamelessly instructed the Kurds, its only reliable local allies, to surrender a town they had bravely liberated from Islamic State.The pattern repeats around the region. Erdoğan has picked a fight with an old enemy, Greece, in recent weeks, sending aircraft to buzz Greek islands after Athens refused to hand over suspects in the 2016 coup. This confrontational behaviour has brought talk of war – a not wholly improbable outcome, given the escalating dispute over energy exploration rights off still-ided Cyprus.Similarly, past attempts to improve relations with Israel have been abandoned in favour of resumed, politically expedient enmity, justified most recently by Erdoğan’s claim to care about dead Palestinians in Gaza.The overall picture reflects a broader deterioration. This week the US Senate tried to block the big-ticket sale of F-35 fighter jets to Turkey after members of Congress accused Erdoğan of “actively operating to undermine US interests around the world”. Turkey, they said, “has made a common practice of aggressively targeting US allies while aiding and abetting our adversaries”. That’s an extraordinary way to talk about a Nato ally.Likewise, Erdoğan’s damaging rows with European countries over refugees and future EU membership, his brute defiance of human rights norms and shared democratic standards, and his growing military collaboration with Vladimir Putin, symbolised by the purchase of advanced Russian S-400 missiles, seem certain to get worse if he wins a new five-year term. Turkey’s voters have a duty to the world, not just to themselves. Kick him out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d88adf6c63feb9695ad46c04a9b5066e342f40f0/0_2134_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b3794a469e653622bb77747379e88ce","title":"the guardian view on mobile phones schools are better without them","story":"When a minister in this government stumbles on a policy that is both popular and good, it’s newsworthy. Matt Hancock, the digital minister, has suggested that schools ban the use of mobile phones by their pupils. Amanda Spielman, the head of Ofsted, agrees. In France, the Macron government has put forward legislation that will ban the use of phones in all primary and middle schools. This removes the matter from the discretion of headteachers. Those who have already purged their playgrounds of screens report few problems. The measure seems entirely straightforward and sensible.The most serious, though, is that the constant interruption and the state of twitchy half-attention promoted by the mobile phone tends to degrade the capacity for sustained attention, which schools need to teach. There is evidence, mentioned by Mr\u0026nbspHancock, that the mere presence of a phone makes it harder to concentrate, even when it is concealed in a bag or container. The expectation of distraction is its own distraction. This isn’t just a matter of listening in lessons. Outside the classroom children are constantly learning – and teaching – important social lessons and they need to do this with their real companions rather than imaginary ones. Real communities are made from people who might not have chosen one another and schools should teach children how to live in them. Paying the tribute of attention to the people around us is part of that.Yet there are practical difficulties with the idea of a national ban on the French model. It would not be reasonable to expect children not to bring their phones to school at all, when so much social life and practical interaction with parents is coordinated with them. If the phones are stored at school that raises security questions about where they are kept. What would be the sanctions for repeat offenders? These are questions for inidual schools and headteachers to decide. If\u0026nbspMr Hancock and Ms Spielman are serious, they should be lobbying for financial support for the schools that must carry out their policy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d8e29ac2c31cd695bf47791a18823dd1d69082d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c198c46aac5a597eba7d3c8cc7be2262","title":"glasgow school art mackintosh recreate masterpiece","story":"To rebuild Mackintosh’s great work would be a long and costly project. But the School of Art has a place in the city’s heartIt has been said that a certain class of person can spend their entire life inside the same kind of institutional architecture, never leaving the mellow English stone of the 17th century in their inevitable progress from boarding school to Oxbridge college to an inn of court. But most of us make a less splendid and more various journey. My primary school dated from 1912, my secondary school from 1934, and my tertiary place of education from 1931.The first of these was the most attractive: “blocky red sandstone art nouveau”, says the Fife volume of the Buildings of Scotland series. Nothing much can be said for the other two, though it was from a classroom on the top floor of the third, the Scottish College of Commerce, that I first noticed the structure that has since become one of the most famous buildings in Scotland – perhaps, since its destruction, the most famous of all.Only a few streets away, its roofline stretched across the near horizon provided by one of Glasgow’s urban hills. From where I sat, it had a military look: small windows set in plain grey walls, odd little protuberances that suggested a fort or a beached destroyer. It was, of course, the Glasgow School of Art (GSA).I didn’t know much about architecture and I wasn’t aware of the art school’s significance. Cities such as Glasgow seemed to have much more in them, then. More shops, more cinemas and theatres, more factories and offices, more pubs, more secondhand bookstores, more newspapers, more streets, more big, black Victorian buildings with unknown histories and purposes – and many more people, because Glasgow’s population has almost halved in the 50-odd years since.To the newcomer, the GSA was no more than one small part of this rewarding density. Not much was made of it. In 1960, a guide to the city, even quite a respectable history of the place, might ignore the name Charles Rennie Mackintosh, even though his designs had given Glasgow the most extraordinary building it will probably ever see.Mackintosh was a 28-year-old assistant in the Glasgow architects’ firm Honeyman \u0026amp Keppie when in 1896 it won the competition to build a new art school for the city, which outside London was then Britain’s foremost centre of artistic enterprise. He did all the drawings, but at first got none of the public credit. The first part opened in 1899: a three-storey studio block that ran east to west along the Garnethill ridge, it had wide, Italianate eaves and big windows to let in the northern light – each window with the square footage of a small flat – as well as ornamental wrought iron in front and unexpected touches of Scots baronial to the rear.How “beautiful” this was is a difficult question to answer. “Striking”, “handsome” and “functional” may be better words. Beauty was a more obvious quality of the inside, where Mackintosh combined un-Victorian amounts of light with plain stone, ironwork and wood. He was, after all, a gifted interior designer as much as an architect: country houses and a chain of tearooms also bore his mark. Nothing, however, surpassed the art school’s library, which was said to be the loveliest room in Glasgow and, according to the late Gavin Stamp, his “finest, most personal and most mysterious creation, a complex space, at once dark and well-lit, in which every detail was personal and deliberate”.Stamp, who taught at the art school from 1990, wrote those words in the London Review of Books after the first fire destroyed the library in 2014, and then added a sentence that was sadly prescient in its scepticism: “The management of the GSA, which, despite warnings about fire, allowed a student to combine expanding foam with a hot projector in the basement, now cheerfully assures us that most of the building is safe.”After the night of 15 June, only the walls remain, and even they may be too heat-damaged to support much more than themselves. What’s to be done? “Restoration” is too mild a term for the damage that would have to be rectified. The National Trust spent five years restoring Uppark, a West Sussex country house, after a disastrous fire in 1989 left its ground floor more than a metre deep in wet ash and rubble: it was a remarkable feat of conservation, but the house was much less ruinous than the GSA and many of its contents survived.The choices facing the Glasgow building seem to be: demolition and replacement “facade-ism”, in which a new interior sits behind the old walls, or some other elements of the old are incorporated with the new or a faithful replica.The last possibility has prompted a small outbreak of: “What would Mackintosh have wanted?” Glasgow architect Alan Dunlop argues: “He was an innovator, working at the cutting edge. He would want to see a new school of art fit for the 21st century.” But ghosts are bad witnesses, and the chances are slim that a new building will stand in relation to the 21st century as Mackintosh’s did to the 20th – as a delightful, singular work that prefigures the future and reflects the past. The better answer, for me and I suspect many others, is a replica.This week, watching the aerial footage of the GSA’s burnt-out shell, I remembered those terrible pictures of German cities in 1945 – many square miles of buildings in the same state, destroyed by carpet-bombing and firestorms. By some calculations these cities – Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg, Dresden, Leipzig and the rest – lost four-fifths of their historic buildings. Many vanished for ever. Others, such as Dresden’s Frauenkirche, have been wonderfully recreated.The latest and possibly largest of these recreations, built at a cost of £500m, is the City Palace in Berlin, which is scheduled to open next year as the home of the Humboldt Forum museum with the former head of the British Museum, Neil MacGregor, as its founding director. MacGregor, a Glaswegian, firmly believes the art school should be rebuilt as it was before. “Just to let it go would be such a loss,” he said this week. “A replica shouldn’t be seen as a fake. It’s a way of a city reasserting its history.”It would be absurd to compare Glasgow to Germany. Nonetheless, at the hands of planners, developers and the all-too-visible hand of economic decline, the city has had a real mauling. To make Mackintosh’s great building anew would be a long and expensive project, but skills would be preserved and passed on, and there would be something to marvel at finally. Every stone, window, beam, stair, shelf should be faithfully copied – and every ceiling fitted with sprinklers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04244928b9a6fc65cb0f899451d95afa46c7c627/0_0_4800_3204/master/4800.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c2255291e6556dc38f82143b1b82cb1 720w","title":"brazil costa rica philippe coutinho world cup group e match report","story":"Well, that was late and indeed a little ugly at times. On a breezy afternoon by the Gulf of Finland Brazil beat Costa Rica 2-0 at the St\u0026nbspPetersburg Stadium to ease their route towards the knockout stage of Russia 2018.The goals were both scored in injury time, the first by their best player on the day Philippe Coutinho, who came haring through a crowd on to a touch from Gabriel Jesus to poke the ball through the legs of Keylor Navas and send the yellow-shirted stands into a fever.As the clock ticked down Neymar added a second, the Costa Rica defence finally parting after some fine, dogged efforts. Brazil’s captain celebrated like a World Cup winner after stabbing the ball into the net from Douglas Costa’s cross. And it was an eventful day all round for Neymar, who grumbled and moaned and threw himself to the floor, and might have been sent off in the second half for a combination of dissent and ing.At the final whistle the world’s costliest player could be seen weeping dramatically on the pitch, shoulders shuddering, hands shielding his visage from the world. Indeed.Brazil have four points in Group\u0026nbspE. A draw with Serbia will guarantee progress. This game will be remembered for Coutinho’s fine driving efforts in central midfield and for some well-timed substitutions by Tite. But it will also be coloured by Neymar’s preposterous antics, and for a sense of lost focus at various stages.A turning point seemed to have arrived around the hour mark as the referee Björn Kuipers of the Netherlands, finally snapped. As Brazil defended a corner Kuipers could be seen telling Brazil’s captain to be quiet in the way an exasperated father might\u0026nbspspeak to a sullen and spoiled teenager.Seventeen minutes later Kuipers was finally beaten into submission. No doubt it wears you down. As Giancarlo González brushed the Neymar abdomen with his hand Brazil’s captain toppled backwards in ludicrous fashion, a dying sapling swept away by a mudslide. Kuipers gave the penalty. Neymar lay on the floor being nursed by his teammates, as though finally\u0026nbspvictorious in his battle with injustice.Out of his sight Kuipers trotted off, looked at the VAR screen, and reversed the decision. He should also have booked Neymar for cheating. But well-played Mr Kuipers. A penalty would have been reward for superstar strops and generally graceless behaviour. A Brazil World Cup campaign is a notch in the nation’s pop-cultural history. It deserves better than this.This World Cup has been waiting for a statement performance, for one of the more celebrated teams to decide that in fact this tournament is there for the taking if somebody can get the thrusters lined up. This wasn’t it from Brazil, at least not for the opening 85 minutes.Hopes had been high at kick-off. The stadium in St Petersburg is a stunning thing with a roof fanned out around steel girders of dizzying scale, ranged above the pitch like an iron giant cradling his fingers.Brazil did press hard at the start, Coutinho shooting just over after Bryan Ruiz had given him the ball.\u0026nbspAfter which, the congealment. The blue shirts were slow through midfield, a porridge of sideways passing. It was Costa Rica who should have taken the lead on 12 minutes, as Celso Borges shot low and hard but past the left-hand post from a cut-back from\u0026nbspRuiz.Neymar began to intrude, writhing and leaping at every challenge. He is targeted for rough treatment but he invites it too, never once hiding his disgust and his distraction.Again he went down, this time after “putting a hat on” Cristian Gamboa (nicking the ball over his head) a terrible humiliation in Brazilian football. Again there were chunterings to the referee, constant close-ups of that pained Neymar face. This is a different player right now to the sprightly warrior of 2014, transformed into a mardy drama magnet. Life moves pretty fast, Neymar old boy. If you don’t stop rolling around once in awhile, you could miss it.As the teams penetrated the dressing rooms at half-time Neymar approached the referee and prattled on some more. Clearly he has rushed his way back to this tournament. But he doesn’t deal with rustiness well. And he was overshadowed by Coutinho here, who was the hub of the team and who should be given as much leverage as he likes to make the game up in front of him.Tite took off Willian at half-time and put on the more direct Douglas Costa. Suddenly Brazil were surging forward, Gabriel Jesus heading powerfully on to the bar from a Costa cross. The ball bounced out to Coutinho whose shot\u0026nbspwas deflected just wide by Gamboa.Tite twisted again, bringing on Roberto Firmino for Paulinho. Neymar shot wide of the post on the run with space in front of him. And moments late he was finally booked, this time for a pathetic hissy fit after a foul. Two late goals disguised a distracted performance that improved as the tempo rose but Tite will have plenty to ponder from here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fd1c2bebf51421d15d5d267c559fdde4e34d4dd/1219_138_2281_1369/master/2281.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20830ff4fef71a9740ee5964bd895a82","title":"serbia switzerland xherdan shaqiri world cup group e match report","story":"Of all the people, it had to be them. Suddenly, in the last minute, Xherdan Shaqiri was racing away, Serbs in pursuit but unable to catch him before he slipped the ball under Vladimir Stojkovic. It was the goal that defeated Serbia and put Switzerland in a strong position to progress to the next round, but it was also much more than that. As he turned and screamed, he took his shirt off, flexed his muscles and performed a double-eagle celebration, a recreation of the Albanian flag. Alongside him, Granit Xhaka did the same – for the second time.Xhaka had scored the equaliser, thumping in from 20 yards, now Shaqiri had the winner. Two Kosovans, two goalscorers, in a stadium where Russian and Serbian fans had come together, supporting a team that Shaqiri and Xhaka do not see as simple opponents. Shaqiri had the Kosovan flag stitched to his boot. Xhaka’s father was imprisoned and beaten in the former Yugoslavia for campaigning in favour of Kosovan independence and his brother Taulant plays for Albania. Together with Valon Behrami, they had been whistled by a crowd that chanted “Serbia-Russia! Serbia-Russia!” A banner declared the two countries “brothers”.They had enjoyed the first half of this game, in which Serbia looked far superior, but had watched as they were hauled back early in the second, and beaten at the death. There could be few complaints either: in the final, frantic 30 minutes, Switzerland, emboldened by their changes and led by Shaqiri, had gone for them. It had not seemed likely since the moment Dusan Tadic cut back on the right and curled in a lovely cross for Aleksander Mitrovic to head past Yann Sommer from seven yards.The game was only five minutes old when the goal was scored, but it hadn’t been Serbia’s first opportunity – from virtually the same spot, Mitrovic had drawn a sharp save from the goalkeeper a minute before, this time supplied by Sergej Milinkovic-Savic – and it wouldn’t be the last either. The same three men were at the heart of everything Serbia did, Tadic, Mitrovc and Milinkovic-Savic combining superbly at a time when all Switzerland could aspire to was resistance.For the Swiss, every ball in was a drama, and there were many of them early on. Mitrovic controlled one on the chest and sent an overhead kick sailing just past the bar. Slowly, though, this became a game, Shaqiri increasingly involved. Blerim Dzemaili couldn’t quite guide Steven Zuber’s pass then bafflingly chose to cross when he should have shot. At the other end, Tadic, Mitrovic and Milinkovic-Savic threatened still and they might have doubled the lead when Dusko Tosic ed through the air, barely four yards out but failed to reach a corner, and Nemanja Matic couldn’t force it in at the far post. Next, Tadic struck a lovely shot on the bounce that flew just over.Switzerland equalised soon after the break, Shaqiri’s blocked shot running to Xhaka who thumped it first time from 20 yards, bending the ball hard into the net. His hands forming an eagle amidst the noise, and the game turned frantic. Tadic delivered a cross from which Mitrovic, hauled to the floor, appealed for a penalty and then sent the ball fizzing across the six-yard box.The best opportunity, though, came for the substitute Mario Gavranovic at the other end who hit the side-netting having been played through by Shaqiri. And Switzerland accelerated, the changes having an impact, Shaqiri running at the Serbs. Gavranovic got another superb chance when the other substitute, Breel Embolo, leaped superbly to head into his path, leaving him in front of goal 12 yards out.That time, Stojkovic scrambled to save but he could do nothing when Shaqiri ran towards him at the last."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfb5b674c267a7ed098018df204166e12cff4a51/177_0_4641_2785/master/4641.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f851d9f7e0e3eb674a4a72dee2d644a","title":"xhaka and shaqiri goal celebrations bring balkan politics to world cup","story":"Switzerland pair, who have Albanian heritage, inflame tensions with Serbia by making nationalist symbolsSwiss footballers Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri have risked inflaming political tensions in the Balkans after they used an Albanian nationalist symbol to celebrate their goals against Serbia in a 2-1 Group E victory in Kaliningrad.The pair, who both have ethnic Albanian heritage but grew up in Switzerland, turned Friday night’s match around after Serbia had taken the lead through Aleksandar Mitrovic early in the first half.Both put their open hands together with their thumbs locked and fingers outstretched to make what looks like the double-headed eagle displayed on Albania’s national flag. The thumbs represent the heads of the two eagles, while the fingers look like the feathers.The gesture is likely to inflame tensions among Serb nationalists and ethnic Albanians.Shaqiri was born in Kosovo, the former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo’s independence and relations between the two countries remain tense. Xhaka’s parents are originally from Kosovo and they are of Albanian heritage. The Arsenal midfielder’s father was imprisoned in the former Yugoslavia for campaigning in favour of Kosovan independence.Shaqiri, who plays for Stoke City, said after the match that “it’s just emotion” when he was questioned about the way he celebrated his late winner.“I think in football you have always emotions,” he said. “You can see what I did and I think it’s just emotion. I’m very happy to score this goal. It’s not more. I think we don’t have to speak about this now.” Switzerland’s coach, Vladimir Petkovic, said: “You should never mix politics and football. It’s clear that emotions show up and that’s how things happen. I think we all together need to steer away from politics in football and we should focus on this sport as a beautiful game and something that brings people together. The buildup to the match had seen exchanges between Serb players and Shaqiri who wears boots with the Kosovo flag displayed on one heel and the Swiss one on the other. Mitrovic asked: “If he loves Kosovo so much and decides to flaunt the flag, why did he refuse a chance to play for their team?”But afterwards, the Serbian boss Mladen Krstajic would not be drawn into the controversy. “I don’t have any comment,” he said. “I don’t deal with these things. I am a man of sports and this is what I am going to stay. I have no comment.” The win puts Switzerland into second place in Group E with four points, the same as Brazil, who beat Costa Rica 2-0 earlier in the evening. The Swiss will advance to the round of 16 if they beat Costa Rica on Wednesday in Nizhny Novgorod. Serbia will face Brazil in Moscow at the same time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9bc68b01ca21c5e49f0518a7ef965c56e2199e1/0_156_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76595b54fc9b4f50f85e6d2886120440","title":"super eagles nigeria switzerland brazil stumble win world cup football daily","story":"Max and co chew the fat regarding wins for Brazil, Nigeria and Switzerland, double-headed eagle celebrations, a fine for Mexico, Swedish iPhone notifications and the best club name in the world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9167c0fb170b9814fd7879f4fc15a2c3040ed73/0_0_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72b4c39a1e5c9b2a0d4f3e594f82a25a","title":"faces of the world cup fans from around the world show their colours","story":"Whether you support Senegal or Switzerland, the World Cup is a great excuse to get out the face paint or lion mask and display your patriotic pride"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc903962f2c9e4e7f49007a2f176b56f87f2c354/0_30_3594_2157/master/3594.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61e06dffccd22614ba0402fb8b90d677","title":"world cup 2018 day 10 buildup with belgium and germany in action live","story":"“Paulo Dybala hit upon the truth in an interview earlier in the year: Messi is simply too good. Dybala said he found him almost impossible to play with because the temptation is always simply to give him the ball. At club levels players adapt at national level, where there is less time and a greater range of talent in the squad, it is far more difficult. Everything goes through him and that makes Argentina predictable and susceptible to being frustrated by sides that pack the centre.”“There is no sign the that Argentinian Football Association can steer the path to a brighter future. For the past four years it has talked of rebuilding, restructuring and reforming but all it has managed to do is repeat, relive and reinforce the worst traits and attitudes. Perhaps most damagingly, it opened bids for a youth training project and chose one that was not even part of the bidding contest. Until 15 years ago the country had boasted, for the better part of a century, some of the best and most progressive child and adolescent development traditions in world football. That has been obliterated.”“Maradona cried. If the spirit of Argentinian machismo weeps, it’s fair game for everyone else, and so Argentinian journalists let it pour through their news and analysis immediately after match.”There is a surfeit of Argentinian pain on which to riff.Nigeria’s win sets up a showdown with Argentina. The two meet in the final round of Group D matches and the two-time World Cup winners requiring a win to be in with a chance of progressing to the knockout stage. Even then, an Iceland upset over Croatia could still put a ner in the works.The other match from yesterday that we haven’t touched on saw Nigeria take a giant step towards the knockout phase with a 2-0 win over Iceland. It was a major improvement on Super Eagles’ first display and one worthy of the much-hyped kit. “Oil rig in Texas here,” emails Steven Winder, “so the matches start right after I finish a 12 hour tour. In any case, I can appreciate Pjotr van Rooijen’s complaint about punditry this year, but he should really appreciate that he doesn’t have Alexi Lalas giving his “in depth analysis”, such as, “Mexico needs to punch Germany on the nose!” In fairness, you could describe what they did in that fashion, but I doubt he knew what he meant going in. I don’t speak Spanish, but I’ve switched entirely over to the Telemundo broadcast for respite.”In the Venn diagram of today’s themes, this is a bullseye. Naturally, much of the focus has been on Neymar (and not just for his pot noodle perm). Coach Tite is unperturbed though, confident his star man will find form the more minutes he gets under his belt. Elsewhere in Switzerland’s Group E, Brazil made very heavy weather of Costa Rica. Two late goals earned the three points but after two matches doubts remain over the Selecao’s form and they could well be on course for a round of 16 meeting with (insert dramatic ‘duh duh duhhhhhh’ music) Germany. The odds on that combination before the start of the tournament must have been at least 7-1.Like many of you it seems, Pjotr van Rooijen is unimpressed with the state of World Cup punditry on UK TV. “Phil Neville has appropriated the term ‘in and around the box’ and now just uses ‘in and around’ for everything,” he laments. “During the Germany – Mexico game he was saying ‘in and around the ball’ and ‘in and around Kroos,’ and that just doesn’t really work does it? You can be in the box, but can you be ‘in’ the ball? Can you be ‘in’ Kroos? I suppose you can, but not during a football match. In terms of punditry and co commentators, this might be the worst World Cup ever.”Before we forget VAR entirely, if VAR analysis is your thing, keep up to date with its progress here:Like Yury Gazinsky, Alastair Chivers is in early with the first email of the day. “Bloody hell mate,” he begins, “how are you up so early for the build up? My girlfriend has just left for China :( so that’s why I’m watching all the highlights at the moment.  better be getting you the best breakfast donuts or something!” First of all, sorry about the absence of your girlfriend, although - on the bright side - it’s not the worst couple of weeks to be home alone. As for the donuts, it’s mid-afternoon here in Australia where  also has a presence. So, as much as I’d like to claim hardship, I deserve no pity. I may well do later this week though with the crucial Australia vs. Peru clash kicking off at midnight Down Under.Serbia were also denied a penalty despite the Swiss executing a two-man tackle that would not have been out of place in a rugby league international. Presumably the VAR operators were binge watching Peaky Blinders or something. Switzerland’s win arrived dripping in intrigue thanks to the Kosovar heritage of goalscorers Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka, controversy foreseen by Nick Ames.Xhaka and Shakiri celebrated by making provocative double-eagle gestures, of which more will be heard, I’m sure.Ok, back to the football, yesterday’s action was surprisingly eventful. In particular Switzerland’s victory over Serbia that sees them take a big step towards qualifying out of Group E and puts Brazil at risk of finishing second in the group or even failing to reach the knockout stages at all. Sticking with fashion, because I know that’s why you tuned in, I’m sure it escaped the attention of nobody that Neymar sported his second striking haircut of Russia 2018 in yesterday’s late show against Costa Rica. I can only hope the Selecao superstar intends to manipulate his mane on a match-by-match basis throughout the tournament - and that Brazil make it all the way to the final. Imagine the possibilities...Speaking of Sampaoli, remember when the debate used to be suit or tracksuit? At this world cup it seems to have become suit with shirt or suit with t-shit.

Yet when you get there, it’s another matterYou’re surely aware, by now, of the Trolley Problem, the most famous of the thought experiments philosophers like to construct when they really ought to be working. But, to recap: a runaway train is hurtling down a track towards five railway workers who’ll be killed unless you pull a lever that will ert it to a siding, where there’s only one worker, who’ll be killed instead. Do you pull the lever? This question sorts people into those for whom all that matters are the consequences (how many humans end up dead?) versus those who think it’s wrong to be the active cause of someone’s death. Most people claim to be the former, until you tweak the story so the dilemma is whether to push a fat man off a\u0026nbspbridge to stop the train and save the five workers. Suddenly, barely anyone is willing to say they’d make the active choice, though the death toll remains identical.A third group of people just finds thought experiments annoyingly unrealistic: in reality, that train would still be stuck in a station 20 miles back, “waiting for a crew member”. A\u0026nbspnew study from Ghent University in Belgium is for them. How do people respond to such dilemmas, the researchers wondered, in real life? Due to the rampant spread of health-and-safety culture, they couldn’t use real trains and actually kill people. Instead, they used mice. All participants answered a raft of moral hypotheticals, but some then faced a real-world choice: would they stand by while a\u0026nbspcountdown clock ticked down, whereupon five mice would receive a painful but non-lethal electric shock? Or would they press a button, erting the shock to a cage containing a single mouse? (The setup wasn’t really real, to be clear: no mice were shocked.) People turned out to be much less likely to choose the passive option when it was no longer hypothetical. When real suffering is involved –\u0026nbspeven mouse suffering – more of us are willing to do what it takes to minimise harmful consequences, whatever our abstract principles.There’s a lesson here, I think, that goes beyond improbable train-related emergencies to any contexts in which we’re trying to predict how we’d respond to events: moral dilemmas, but also how we’d cope with a breakup or bereavement, whether we’d flourish or founder if we switched careers, whether we’d be happier moving to another city, and so on. Thinking ahead to any such situation – as when contemplating the Trolley Problem – you’re obliged to rely on your intellect and powers of reasoning. You try to think of all relevant variables, and figure out how they’d interact.Yet when you get there, as when those experimental subjects saw the mice, it’s another matter. You respond not just intellectually but emotionally and bodily your automatic, intuitive brain (“system one”, in Daniel Kahneman’s terminology) kicks in and even on the intellectual\u0026nbsplevel, there may be numerous variables\u0026nbspyou’d failed to think of.Hypothetical thinking, in short, can only ever be a\u0026nbsppale imitation of real life. On balance, that’s good news: a reason to worry less about the future, and trust that, if the situation you’re fretting about occurs, you might surprise yourself by knowing precisely what to do.Would You Kill The Fat Man?, by David Edmonds, is the definitive account of “trolleyology”, and an unnerving way to discover that your moral principles are a lot more fluid than you thought.Read this: In her 2017 book We Need To Talk, the American journalist Celeste Headlee investigates why we’re so remarkably bad at listening to other viewpoints, and offers strikingly useful tips for better conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76ebe29c4111d78ac3f0afd7eb22c373c388c569/307_464_7882_4729/master/7882.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2308a9babc7196c9d53c96b625c4fce","title":"thomasina miers recipe for raspberry cardamom and almond cake","story":"A sticky, fruity treat is just the pudding for a summertime picnicHot sun, sweet berries.

The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cabcc8d37a79b853e89f5857d27a29c9a678333c/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07d1af13bfd4fd36439111876db5a0cc","title":"netflix chief of communications leaving after reports of using n word","story":"Jonathan Friedland is gone from the company after reportedly using the racial slur twice during work meetingsNetflix’s chief communications officer, Jonathan Friedland, is leaving the video streaming company after reports that he had twice used the N-word during work meetings.A company spokesperson confirmed on Friday that Friedland was leaving the company, without giving more details.

But industry experts say that many of these inconveniences are part of new approaches designed to beat touts and secondary sellers, ultimately improving the consumer experience.Fans attending the last two shows of Ed Sheeran’s four nights at Cardiff’s Principality stadium this weekend will be greeted by a flashing sign welcoming “Victims of Viagogo”. When Sheeran’s tour went on sale in June 2017, he was clear that tickets bought through secondary ticketing sites would be invalid and asked the four major resellers not to list his performances in order to avoid inconvenience: only Viagogo refused to comply. Any fans holding invalid Viagogo tickets are being offered the opportunity to buy a new face value seat, which has led to widely publicised queues. The Rolling Stones have offered fans holding tickets bought through Viagogo a similar face value exchange.Stuart Galbraith is the chief executive of Sheeran’s tour promoter, Kilimanjaro Live. “They’re still quoting that they have the cheapest tickets in town for the Cardiff gigs,” he says of Viagogo. “And we know they don’t have the tickets they say they’ve got.” Before Sheeran’s Wembley show on 14 June, his management witnessed Viagogo operatives buying tickets from touts in order to fulfil fraudulently sold orders, says Galbraith. A police search recovered 20 empty envelopes for Viagogo orders printed with an order number and the number of tickets that they were supposed to contain. “We hope that it’ll lead to them being investigated,” says Galbraith.In keeping with a wider backlash against Taylor Swift, there has been some schadenfreude over reports that the UK leg of her Reputation tour, concluding tonight in London, hasn’t sold out. The tour has had its own ticketing inconsistencies: some fans in Manchester had their front row spots swapped for seats towards the back of the Etihad stadium owing to a production issue, while others were given unexplained upgrades. Thomas Kent from Wakefield received a text message three days before the concert telling him to check online to find out the location of his new seats, moving him from 10 rows back in a side block to a central position four rows from the front.Swift’s tour wasn’t designed to sell out immediately, promoter Ticketmaster explained to the Wall Street Journal. Instead “aggressive pricing” and a fan-oriented purchasing system were intended to prevent the resale of tickets at higher prices. In the US only, half the tickets for Swift’s tour were allocated to Ticketmaster’s Verified Fan presale, in which fans could register for the opportunity to buy tickets early and participate in a controversial scheme to improve their queue position by streaming Swift’s videos and buying her merchandise. However, the Wall Street Journal questioned whether the term “slow ticketing” was a way of rebranding ticket sales that were slower than expected owing to their cost.It points to the key difference between Sheeran and other artists. Standard tickets for Swift’s tour cost between £83.70 and £340, with hospitality and VIP packages running to £735. Tickets to Sheeran’s tour cost between £49 and £88. He does not offer VIP experiences. “He feels his customers should have equal access at sensible ticket prices,” says Galbraith. Many assume that Sheeran’s one-man show means less glitz thus lower overheads, but this isn’t the case, says Galbraith: “The production is just as big as any other tour.” He speculates that Sheeran’s tour runs on a different model from other musicians: “The calculation is, what do we need to charge to make this work? It should be the reverse: what should the customer be paying and what should we do to make that work?”The high cost of stadium concert tours is deterring some fans from buying tickets, along with the fact that restrictive British weather and the dates of major sports fixtures mean that these large shows take place in a relatively concentrated summer period. The effects are visible: in Glasgow, tickets for Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s On the Run II tour (£51 to £475) were given away in the car park before the show. Justin Timberlake recently cancelled three of his upcoming UK tour dates without explanation, leading fans to assume that the shows were undersold owing to the poor commercial performance of his latest album, Man of the Woods.Thomas Kent paid £267 for his two original tickets to see Swift, reasoning that “when you’re paying £80 and you can’t even see Taylor, you might as well spend more for a better experience”. He also had full-price tickets to see Shakira this month but resisted paying upfront to see Katy Perry because he couldn’t justify all three. Ultimately he found £29 tickets for Perry’s Sheffield show on Groupon, having heard about similar offers in the US. “They charge too much money for the everyday person, especially when lots of people tour at the same time,” Kent says of major pop tours. “A few years ago, £50-ish was what you would pay for standing at an arena show and it just keeps going up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ee76f7ea3560fb05690da4b9f0865390e752dc2/97_0_2270_1362/master/2270.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22a7acfcfdfde991204c0f60e86726df","title":"paul mccartney serves up surprise performance in liverpool pub","story":"Rock star returns to home city for appearance on Carpool Karaoke with James CordenAs homecoming gigs for one of the world’s biggest rock stars go, it was fairly low key: a small band on a slightly bigger stage in a local pub. But for the drinkers who just happened to be in the Philharmonic Dining Rooms in Liverpool, seeing Sir Paul McCartney perform was probably the best gig of their lives.There was amazement, dancing and more than a few tears when one of Liverpool’s most celebrated sons returned for his appearance on The Late Late Show’s Carpool Karaoke with James Corden on Tuesday.McCartney performed a piano rendition of When I’m Sixty-Four as he revisited his childhood home, showing Corden the back room where he wrote songs with fellow Beatle John Lennon. Walking upstairs in the small terrace, he showed off his old “acoustic chamber” – the toilet where he would sit, strum and sing for hours.Describing how he and Lennon had played She Loves You to his father, McCartney recalls him asking if they could change the refrain to “yes, yes, yes” because there were already too many Americanisms in common use. “We did not heed his advice. Had we have done, who knows what could have happened,” he said. Tweeting a link to the episode, Corden wrote: “Ok, so here it is. Quite possibly the best #CarpoolKaraoke we’ve done so far. I hope you like it. I’ll never ever forget it. Take a breath and jump in.”The pair started the show singing the Beatles hit Drive My Car, while cruising through the city, replacing the song’s “beep beeps” with honks of the horn. On Penny Lane, they popped into a barber shop – which had a picture on the wall of a much younger McCartney getting his hair cut – much to the delight of the hairdresser. Corden became emotional as the pair sang Let It Be in the car. “I can remember my granddad, who’s a musician, and my dad sitting me down and saying, ‘We’re going to play you the best song you’ve ever heard’. And I remember them playing me that. If my granddad was here right now, he’d get an absolute kick out of this,” Corden said. “That’s the power of music,” McCartney replied.McCartney harmonised with Corden singing Blackbird and his new single Come On to Me from the album Egypt Station.But the 18-time Grammy award winner saved the best performance until last, when he appeared from behind a curtain in the Liverpool Philharmonic Dining Rooms, or “the Phil”, where he had played and occasionally drunk as a young man.Within seconds, the small crowd was on its feet, and more poured through the door as word spread, as he performed A Hard Day’s Night, Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, Love Me Do, Back in the USSR and Hey Jude. The star said the journey back to his childhood home had made him reflect on the trajectory of his life. “The distance from here to where we went, and where we are now is phenomenal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f47444656a84109e1640db0a28b46c8170d0e6b/0_0_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c4377d723f16e90053a35668fa332a7","title":"the age of patriarchy how an unfashionable idea became a rallying cry for feminism today","story":"A term that was derided and abandoned a decade ago has come roaring back to life. On 7 January this year, the alt-right insurgent Steve Bannon turned on his TV in Washington DC to watch the Golden Globes. The mood of the event was sombre. It was the immediate aftermath of multiple accusations of rape and sexual assault against film producer Harvey Weinstein, which he has denied. The women, whose outfits would normally have been elaborate and the subject of frantic scrutiny, wore plain and sober black. In the course of a passionate speech, Oprah Winfrey told the audience that “brutally powerful men” had “broken” something in the culture. These men had caused women to suffer: not only actors, but domestic workers, factory workers, agricultural workers, athletes, soldiers and academics. The fight against this broken culture, she said, transcended “geography, race, religion, politics and workplace”.Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, was one of 20 million Americans watching. In his view, the scene before him augured the beginning of a revolution “even more powerful than populism”, according to his biographer Joshua Green. “It’s deeper. It’s primal. It’s elemental. The long black dresses and all that – this is the Puritans. It’s anti-patriarchy,” Bannon declared. “If you rolled out a guillotine, they’d chop off every set of balls in the room … Women are gonna take charge of society. And they couldn’t juxtapose a better villain than Trump. He is the patriarch.” He concluded: “The anti-patriarchy movement is going to undo 10,000 years of recorded history.”Until very recently, “patriarchy” was not something rightwing men were even supposed to believe in, let alone dilate upon with such apocalyptic relish. It was the sort of word that, if uttered without irony, marked out the speaker as a very particular type of person – an iron-spined feminist of the old school, or the kind of ossified leftist who complained bitterly about the evils of capitalism. Even feminist theorists had left it behind.Nevertheless, “patriarchy” has, in the past year or so, bloomed in common parlance and popular culture. Once you tune into it, you cannot escape it: it is emblazoned on banners and T-shirts it is an unexpected recent addition to the vocabulary of the red-carpet interview it is there in newspaper headlines, explaining everything from the Irish abortion vote to the recent murder of 10 people in Toronto in a van attack, allegedly by a violently misogynistic “incel” – a man who believes he has been denied a right to sex with women. Outside the anglophone world, the Spanish patriarcado has been getting a workout so too the German Patriarchat, the Italian patriarcato and the French patriarcat. As the #MeToo campaign has grown, so has the use of “patriarchy”. It has burst its way out of the attic of half-discarded concepts to greet a moment – one of fourth-wave feminist ferment – in which there is a newly urgent need to name what women are still struggling against. The resurgence of the term is all the more surprising when one considers the forces ranged against it. Many people would question the existence of something called “patriarchy” to begin with – pointing to the strides made in gender equality over the past century, and insisting that instances of sexism are inidual and isolated, destined to fade further over time, rather than evidence of a persistent structure of inequality. There are others, meanwhile, who regard the term’s very reappearance as another sign that #MeToo has “gone too far” – and see “patriarchy” as the hysterical war cry of McCarthyite feminists determined to hunt down men who are guilty of nothing more than past behaviours once considered perfectly acceptable.For some sceptical liberals, there is a resistance to the ideological implications of grand concepts such as “patriarchy” (or “neoliberalism”), which are seen as oversimplifications of a more complex reality. Among gender studies academics, it is no longer in wide use. Once a term debated in endless articles, conferences and books, many theorists now regard it is as too blunt and monolithic to capture the nuances of oppression. Paradoxically, some on the right have enthusiastically taken up the term – regarding it not as an evil to be stamped out, but as a “natural” difference between the genders, ordained by God or biology, to be protected against rampaging feminism.But for those who have lost a basic trust in the forward motion of human progress – or who were born too recently to have known it – “patriarchy” seems exactly the word to explain the continued existence of pervasive, seemingly ineradicable inequality. The moment of #MeToo brought this into relief: it revealed to many feminists that despite all those years of working hard, of leaning in, of waiting till unfairness gradually ebbed away, of absorbing and internalising sexism, of building starry careers or else toiling away in menial jobs in the hope that their children would have it better, you could still be pinned to a bed or cornered at a party or groped, or leered at or catcalled by a man – simply because of your woman’s body.In this moment, the concept of “patriarchy” has offered itself as the invisible mechanism that connects a host of seemingly isolated and disparate events, intertwining the experience of women of vastly different backgrounds, race and culture, and ranging in force from the trivial and personal to the serious and geopolitical. For it allows us to ask, according to the philosopher Amia Srinivasan, “whether there is something in common between the Weinstein affair, the election of Trump, the plight of women garment workers in Asia and women farm workers in North America, and the Indian rape epidemic. It allows people to ask whether some machine is at work that connects all the experiences they’re having with all the experiences others are having.” The return of “patriarchy” raises the question: does the naming and understanding of this invisible mechanism offer the key to its destruction?For much of human history, the persistence of male domination was so much part of the oxygen of life that patriarchy was not even identified as a concept – unlike democracy, autocracy or oligarchy, whose relative merits were vigorously debated by the Greeks. The notion that male supremacy was “natural” was self-fulfilling, since those who wrote the laws, the poems, the religious books, the philosophy, the history, the medical treatises and the scientific texts were, very largely, men writing for the benefit of men. As Jane Austen’s character Anne Elliot says: “Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands.” You might even say that patriarchy’s particular power is its capacity to make itself as invisible as possible it tries very hard not to draw attention to the means of its endurance.But if you look at the world with patriarchy in view, you might see how some intelligent, successful and apparently assertive women fail to leave men who humiliate them and monitor their every move (such are the hallmarks of “coercive control”, now a criminal offence). You might see why even apparently liberal organisations, even those run by women, still have a gender pay gap. Or why about 80 women a year, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, are murdered by a male partner or ex-partner. Why women do more childcare and housework than men, and why this domestic “second shift” has until recently been completely ignored by economists. Why the clothing of Angela Merkel and Theresa May is avidly critiqued, but that of Emmanuel Macron is not. Why there are so few meaningful female characters in films. Some concepts are like a pair of spectacles that allow otherwise invisible or inexplicable things to be seen with sudden sharpness: “patriarchy” is one of them.The word literally means “rule of the father”, from the ancient Greek. There are many different ideas about its extent and force. Some people have used it to describe patterns derived from the structure of the family to others, it is an entire system of oppression built on misogyny and the exploitation and brutalisation of women. It is not simple, in fact, to produce a concise definition of patriarchy. But at its simplest, it conveys the existence of a societal structure of male supremacy that operates at the expense of women – rather in the way that “white supremacy” conveys the existence of a societal structure that operates at the expense of black people.Part of the idea of “patriarchy” is that this oppression of women is multilayered. It operates through inequalities at the level of the law and the state, but also through the home and the workplace. It is upheld by powerful cultural norms and supported by tradition, education and religion. It reproduces itself endlessly through these norms and structures, which are themselves patriarchal in nature and thus it has a way of seeming natural or inevitable, or else, in a liberal context, it is obscured by piecemeal advances in gender equality. Because it offers the idea of a structure of power relations, rather than a series of specific sexist acts, “patriarchy” accommodates the idea that not all men enthusiastically uphold it or benefit equally from it and that some women may, on the other hand, do a great deal towards supporting it. It also allows for the fact that however much we might loathe it, we all, perforce, participate in it.Once you see the world through the lenses of “patriarchy”, the thought naturally arises: what would the world be like if it weren’t there? Some feminists have argued that if women gain equal rights in society, patriarchy will be at least sufficiently tempered. Others have argued that even if equality were achieved, patriarchy would still exist, because human institutions – political, legal, educational, cultural – are themselves, in their bones, patriarchal structures. But it says something about the nature of this inquiry that it has most vividly been answered by writers of speculative fiction. In the 19th-century novel Herland, Charlotte Perkins Gilman imagined a women-only society: one of calm justice, efficient agriculture and comfortable clothing with lots of pockets. In Naomi Alderman’s novel The Power, published last year, women, through a kink of evolution, gain superior physical strength over men. A bloody revolution ensues, and there is no hint that the resulting reversal of patriarchy – matriarchy – will be any less oppressive than what it has replaced. It seems to be a zero-sum game.“Patriarchy” is not a stable concept. It has fallen in and out of fashion, flourishing at moments of feminist renewal. Nevertheless, feminism began without it. Mary Wollstonecraft was clear, in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) that there was such as thing as “the tyranny of men”, but it was another 60 years before the term “patriarchy” was adopted as something like a theory of social relations.By the mid-19th century, the world was coming to seem older, bigger and more unstable than it had done before. In 1859, Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was published. Marx’s Das Kapital would follow in 1867. At the same time, work by anthropologists and ancient historians was revealing that there were, and had been, family structures, legal systems and whole societies that looked radically different from those in modern Paris, Berlin or London. Industrialisation and urbanisation were underway in Europe, especially in Britain women were rapidly entering the workforce. Two years after On the Origin of Species, and six years before Das Kapital, a Swiss jurist and classicist called Johann Jakob Bachofen published a book whose influence remains nearly as pervasive – even though hardly anyone has heard of it now, its substantive claims have been repudiated, and it has never been fully translated into English from its original German. It was taken up strongly by Friedrich Engels it deeply interested Sigmund Freud and its theories were absorbed by early archaeologists and prehistorians. The book was called Das Mutterrecht (“Mother Right”), and its grand theory was that, in a distant prehistoric era, the father’s role in begetting children had not been yet recognised, and women (and mother goddesses) held power in the world.For Bachofen, matriarchy and patriarchy were opposites: dark versus light, “the bloody law of the earth” set against “the pure celestial power of the sun”. His vision of the elementally opposed “female” and “male” has been hugely influential. The idea of an earthbound, essentially non-rational femininity has sometimes been claimed by feminists in a very different way, you can hear the echoes of the rhetoric, roughly filtered through Nietzsche and Jung, in the statements of rightwing male supremacists of today, especially those who speak of the “chaos” of the feminine. Bachofen himself was no feminist. The idea of the Amazons – mythical female warriors – particularly disturbed him. They represented “an extreme and decadent form of gynecocracy … man-hating, man-killing, bellicose virgins”, he wrote.When the term “patriarchy” started to circulate in this new formulation, it opened up new avenues of thought on the left. Engels, in The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, drew deeply on Bachofen in order to argue that patriarchy was a crucial factor in the emergence of capitalism. For him, the arrival of patriarchy – which was associated with the recognition of fatherhood, the development of monogamous marriage and inheritable private property – represented “the world-historical defeat of the female sex. The man took command in the home also the woman was degraded and reduced to servitude, she became the slave of his lust and a mere instrument for the production of children”.It took a female thinker, and a feminist, to pull “patriarchy” out of the realm of theory and into the zone of experience. Virginia Woolf’s Three Guineas (1938) set “patriarchy” to work on the reality of her own circumstances. For her, it described the dynamics within families like hers – in which the father held economic power and authority, boys were trained for public life and girls were debarred from either a serious education or the opportunity to earn a living. The battle lines were drawn “between the victims of the patriarchal system and the patriarchs”. In other words, it was “the daughters against the fathers”.Woolf did not here write of “patriarchy” as a social structure that went beyond the boundaries of the bourgeois household. Nor did she have time for feminine essentialism: she predicted that the opportunity for women to amass capital and property on equal terms as men would mean that women could change “from being the victims of the patriarchal system … to being the champions of the capitalist system”. She expanded: “Behind us lies the patriarchal system: the private house, with its nullity, its immorality, its hypocrisy, its servility. Before us lies the public world, the professional system, with its possessiveness, its jealousy, its pugnacity, its greed.” It is an ambiguous picture: she shows little admiration for the capitalist world she describes. And yet in her formulation – an idea that some later feminists would find themselves echoing – the “creative destruction” of capitalism had the capacity to leave patriarchy behind.In the late 1960s and early 70s, amid the ferment of revolutionary thought on the campuses of western Europe and north America, a new generation of feminist activists emerged. It was clear to them that oppression continued to bear down on women despite their increased access to the rights that Woolf’s generation fought for – access to education, the vote and the workplace. It was also obvious that existing theories of power were not equipped to explain this oppression: women had been of little interest as subjects for economics, history and sociology, with questions of gender inequality either ignored entirely or regarded as a natural byproduct of societal development. For the feminists of the second wave, part of the work was to bring women into the light. Oppression could be eradicated only if it could be identified, understood and effectively treated, quite possibly with radical or revolutionary medicine.“Patriarchy” at first provided the most useful focus for this work. Kate Millett’s Sexual Politics (1970) was an early text that attempted to flesh out “patriarchy” into society’s “most fundamental concept of power”. For her, patriarchy was everywhere it was “the most pervasive ideology of our culture”. Even ordinary, apparently harmless social norms were in fact tools of oppression, according to her analysis: romantic love, for example, was simply a means of emotionally manipulating the female by the male, tricking her into subservience. Female compliance was also ensured by force – by rape. Women were socialised into pleasing, flattering, entertaining and gratifying men. Millett called the assumed birthright of male dominance “a most ingenious form of ‘interior colonisation’,” which was “sturdier than any form of segregation, and more rigorous than class stratification, more uniform, and certainly more enduring”.The feminist Rosalind Coward, author of Patriarchal Precedents: Sexuality and Social Relations (1983), one of the weightier academic tomes on the subject, recalls going to “endless conferences and meetings” in the 1970s and 80s where the idea of the patriarchy was discussed, analysed and thoroughly broken down. Her own book sets out some of the most pressing questions, not least the conundrum of where it actually came from. “Patriarchy offers itself as an account of the history of sexual relations, but at a certain point the same question has to be asked: why was it men who took control and what were the interests thus served? These questions lead back with an unerring certainty to the same isions: are there natural sexual differences in which the sexes have distinct interests? Or are sexual dispositions produced by the patriarchal structure itself?” She had hit on a problem of circular thinking in relation to patriarchy – if it had emerged from some kind of a pre-patriarchal society, then surely the patriarchy would have been required in order to produce it in the first place.“Patriarchy” sprouted dozens of reformulations and refinements as feminists attempted to theorise it into a coherent system of domination. The radical feminist Catharine MacKinnon took a hardline view: she saw patriarchy as inscribed into the very structures of the liberal state. “Men against women” was precisely the fuel that kept society, as it is currently constituted, running. By contrast, the African American feminist bell hooks resisted the notion that the primary conflict in society was one of “men against women”, which seemed inherent in radical definitions of “patriarchy”. For her, it could be simply defined as “institutionalised sexism”. In order to end it, everyone, male and female alike, must “let go of sexist thoughts and action”.Lived reality threw up problems with the concept. Experience tells us that some men are oppressed more than some women. Not all women are oppressed in the same way. Writers such as hooks pointed out that for African American women, the family was not necessarily the site of oppression it was for white people, representing a place of possible refuge from the traumas of white supremacy. The kind of workplaces available to many black women, too, were not of the liberating kind accessible to educated white women.Queer theorist Judith Butler critiqued MacKinnon’s universalising view of patriarchy on similar grounds, arguing that it involved “erasures” of other forms of subtle and layered oppression it was a kind of “theoretical imperialism”. Butler also sought to question the “naturalness” of gender. There were many possible categories of gendered and sexual practice, she argued, not simply the binary definitions that dominated the culture. And for psychoanalytically inclined feminist thinkers such as Jacqueline Rose, “the notion that all men are a category in opposition to all women breaks down because not all men are men,” she told me. “That is, not all men embody the kind of masculinity that men are supposed to inhabit.”The eventual rejection by many feminists of the usefulness of “patriarchy” as a fine-grained analytic concept coincided with a general diminuendo in feminist debate in the 1990s and early 2000s – a period later identified by the feminist Beatrix Campbell as a time of “neoliberal neopatriarchy”. Rapid globalisation and a culture of hyperinidualism, Campbell argued in The End of Equality (2013), had in fact led to yet more extreme forms of oppression, citing brutal conditions for labouring women in Mexico, the disproportionate number of female foetuses aborted in India and everywhere a working week “institutionalised in the interests of men unencumbered by duties of care”. While feminism had not died, during this period, it had certainly withered, she wrote.A few years earlier, in her book The Aftermath of Feminism (2008), Angela McRobbie had questioned her own initial enthusiasm for the symbols of the “third-wave feminism” of that period: Sex and the City “girl power” pole-dancing classes. In those days, to throw around the word “patriarchy” – when many people assumed that moral and economic progress were destined to eradicate inequality – would have seemed eccentric, misguided or plain mad. Women, or so it seemed, had never had it so good.Patriarchy is nimble and lithe. Its margins of operation always seem to be expanding. Feminists have naturally tended to arrange their battle lines in front of the aspect of oppression that they have regarded as the most pressing. If “patriarchy” has returned as an idea in public debate, it is because feminism has returned with renewed vigour because inequality has not been eradicated.In 1990, the feminist Sylvia Walby crisply laid out six areas of patriarchal oppression in her book Theorizing Patriarchy they still seem to be ticking along nicely. In the home, women still do most of the domestic labour. In the workplace, a legal right to equal pay has not resulted in the eradication of the gender pay gap. At the level of the state, women are underrepresented nearly everywhere in the world in parliaments, legislatures, the military and other bodies. In terms of male violence, the charity Rape Crisis estimates that in Britain, 11 rapes are carried out or attempted every hour of every day. Women and men are still judged differently when it comes to sex. And the “patriarchal gaze” is still strong in education, religion, culture and the media. And so, for feminists right now, the uses of “patriarchy” are greater than its analytic flaws it allows feminists to perceive the gap between the status quo and what they would like to achieve. “If patriarchy weren’t effective, we wouldn’t need feminism if it were totally effective, we wouldn’t have feminism,” Jacqueline Rose told me.Feminists of an older generation note that the popular revival of “patriarchy” has not (yet) been accompanied by the intense debate and academic theorising that flowered around it the 1970s. It is a slogan and a popular rallying cry rather than an analytic tool. “What I don’t like about it,” said Mary Beard, “is that it is convenient and simple. I don’t really like ‘misogyny’ either, for the same reason. It’s no more a tangible ‘thing’ than capitalism. Saying ‘crush the patriarchy’ has a nice ring, but it doesn’t contain any political analysis.”While it is true that lots of intangible things are pressed into service as useful abstractions for helping us understand the world, some feminists still worry that “patriarchy” is in danger of being oversimplified in the course of being co-opted into public debate. “It is now seemingly used almost interchangeably with sexism,” Rosalind Coward said, “and it certainly doesn’t seem to be accompanied by a discussion about where it came from.” Jacqueline Rose told me: “It’s used as a call-out phrase, as if it explained everything. It’s fine to use it as a tool, as long as you don’t mistake it for a complete description of how the world is organised.”But then, perhaps the revival of “patriarchy” is a bellwether for today’s feminism, which is presently more concerned with action than theory. The concept has survived its biggest theoretical challenge – that of intersectionality, which argues that “patriarchy” universalises and oversimplifies the subtle realities of oppression – because it offers a description of the world that many people recognise, and that unites the many people who want to fight against it. It is particularly suited to today’s fast-moving, hyper-connected digital feminism, where immediate, personal connections can be made in an instant between feminists across the world and radicalising work done in a moment.“Patriarchy” is also deeply energising to those who use it. There is a certain relief in giving a name to the affliction. It has a satisfying ring of old-fashioned radicalism about it, and it comes with a sharp flavouring of conflict. “Patriarchy” is a battle cry. That is not surprising: the internet has enabled the rapid expansion of feminist campaigning, but also the deep and sometimes violent radicalisation of those who fear and hate it. A reaction against the new feminism has arrived almost simultaneously, as the discontents of disgruntled and unsettled men are stirred and stoked online, in the so-called manosphere. Cynical politicians crusading against “political correctness”, such as Trump, have fed off this baleful energy. In this clamorous world, “patriarchy” has become “the patriarchy”, a further simplification that makes it seem even more crude and concrete – less of an invisible mechanism, more of a statue to be smashed.One might reasonably ask whether the patriarchy is truly in any danger, as Steve Bannon fears. It is easier to topple patriarchs, as Susan Faludi pointed out in the wake of Weinstein, than patriarchy. Powerful men who have been called out by #MeToo have left the room, but the room itself still looks very much the same. (Some of the men, too, look very much as if they will be returning to the room quite soon.) If anything can unravel “the rule of the father”, it is likely to be the gradual shift in the way gender and sexuality are being understood. New ways of bringing up children outside traditional family structures will chip away at it. So will the rising generation of bold young feminists who have not internalised oppression like their elders, and who are calling out sexism and misogyny where they see it.But Bannon can relax. As Mary Beard said recently: “Patriarchy has had several thousand years of practice – of course it’s good at it. It’s very good at bolstering its own sexist values.” If a horde of angry leading women did take a guillotine to the testicles of Harvey Weinstein, patriarchy would survive. The word “patriarchy” ought to be a reminder that Weinstein and his ilk are the symptom, not the disease – but it is easier to tackle iniduals than structures, signs rather than causes.At the moment – although the picture varies wildly across the globe – feminists are increasingly using the tool of “patriarchy” to recognise the subtle depth of the forces that keep oppression in place, from the expectations about the behaviour of women in the workplace to the way they are portrayed in fiction. It will be harder to unravel the effect of this cultural inheritance than it was to get the vote. As Max Weber observed, it is the very longevity of patriarchal traditions and norms that serve to prop it up – “the belief in the inviolability of that which has existed from time out of mind”. The eradication of patriarchy looks like a task of enormous complexity when it is smashed, it will take a lot down with it. And so the patriarchs – from the bully in the White House to the bully in your workplace – are still in charge.

The Speaker, who was elected in 2009, said in the run-up to that election he would stand down within nine years – meaning Friday would be his deadline – as he did not see the post as a job for life.He has faced calls from some MPs to stick to his original promise and resign after a series of allegations about his bullying behaviour towards former Commons staff, all of which he has denied. But a source close to the Speaker’s office said “the clock was reset” at the 2017 general election when Bercow stood for re-election pledging to see the Brexit process through.His election literature from last year, obtained by the , said: “Once the ballot papers have been counted, the country will have a few challenging years as we seek to establish a new relationship with the European Union. “In the House of Commons, for example, this could require as many as 15 different new laws, some of which will be very complicated and highly technical in nature. “During this process, I believe that parliament and the nation would be best served by a very experienced Speaker with an established track record of efficiency, fairness and sensitivity to all sides of the argument. It is on this basis as well as my local record as your MP that I seek re-election.”The source added: “This election material speaks for itself – the clock was reset in 2017 and the Speaker was voted in on the basis that he would see the Brexit process through.”Bercow has gained a reputation as a moderniser who changed the sitting hours of the Commons so they would be more family-friendly and has attempted to make ministers more accountable to parliament. However, he was forced to defend his impartiality after it was reported that he backed remain at the EU referendum and he provoked controversy after vetoing an address to parliament by the US president, Donald Trump, in an unprecedented intervention.This week it emerged that £2.4m of taxpayers’ money had been used for non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements to prevent 53 Commons staff from speaking out after they left.Bercow’s office said: “The Speaker was elected by the house in 2017 for the course of the parliament. In the event he has anything to say on his future plans, he will make an announcement to the house first.”Favourites to succeed Bercow include the deputy speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who is known for his low-key, no-nonsense approach and who proved himself last month when he stood in for Bercow during PMQs, leaving some MPs shouting “more, more”. Harriet Harman, Britain’s longest-serving female MP who has a reputation for being firm but fair, is said to be interested in the role, which would make her only the second female Speaker in the Commons’ history.The senior Labour backbencher Chris Bryant has also been tipped for the post, along with the Tory Eleanor Laing, who is also a deputy speaker, although convention suggests it is more likely to be a Labour politician next time round.

David Davis told the Express that there is “lots going on” to make sure the government was ready in case negotiations collapsed.Their party colleague, Anna Soubry, will be among the speakers at the London march along with the Labour MP David Lammy and the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, while the campaignerGina Miller and the actor Sir Tony Robinson will also address those present from 2pm.Their protest will be opposed by a far-right UK Unity and Freedom march, which will start in Victoria at 2pm and head to College Green, near Parliament Square. It is expected to be smaller, with a few thousand people attending. Promoters say it will “focus on freedom from the EU, freedom from terror, freedom of speech, freedom from sharia law and unity of all people irrespective of race or creed”. Gerard Batten, the Ukip leader, is expected to be present, but not the former leader Nigel Farage. Police also expect members of the far-right English Defence League and the anti-Islam group Pegida to show up at a march that will conclude a few hundred metres away from where the People’s Vote event will end, and near an Eid celebration in Trafalgar Square.Anti-Brexit campaigners are focused on trying to create popular support for a referendum on whatever deal Theresa May achieves in negotiations with the EU. Polling and focus group work led Open Britain to use the phrase People’s Vote in calling for a final referendum, in which remaining in the EU would be an option on the ballot paper.The People’s Vote campaign is also highlighting the role of ordinary citizens, with Ciaran Donovan, a delivery driver from Romford, east London, expected to appear on stage to sign a petition demanding a referendum on the final deal. The roughly £100,000 cost of the protest was raised over seven days by a crowdfunding campaign.The George Soros-backed group Best for Britain has been separately campaigning for a second referendum, focusing on newspaper and outdoor advertising, and local campaigning in parliamentary seats where they hope to persuade the sitting MP to support an amendment for another vote. It is encouraging supporters to attend the People’s Vote march."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa9dec00a2f0f81b53646b40fafdbe4bcb017aed/0_0_3064_1838/master/3064.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19c81e73b2553772e606ae78849f8b16","title":"gangs families should lose council homes urges minister","story":"Police and councils have tested the eviction scheme in north London, Victoria Atkins saysFamilies of gang members who are living in council housing should have those homes taken away from them in order to deter the criminals, a government minister has said.Victoria Atkins, a Home Office minister, backed a scheme being trialled in north London that threatens whole families in council homes with eviction and offers leniency to gang members in some low-level cases, such as possession of cannabis.In a newspaper interview published on Friday, she backed the scheme, saying the government had “changed the law to enable it to happen” and claiming it would force people involved in violent crimes to “understand the consequences” of their actions.“In the most serious cases, with these people who are exploiting young people, making the lives of local residents a misery, putting fear into people’s hearts when they’re picking children up from the school gates, I think absolutely they should understand the consequences of their criminal behaviour,” Atkins told the Daily .Critics have previously attacked such powers as “discriminatory and unfair as well as illogical and ineffective”.They are conferred by the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014. As the bill was passing through the parliamentary process, Liberty said: “Whole families could be turfed from their homes because of the actions of one person. This will pile pressure on innocent and vulnerable people at a particularly difficult time for them and their family.”It said people who had passed through the criminal justice system would be doubly punished. “A basic principle of criminal law is that an inidual should be subject to appropriate punishment for their crime just once. Our criminal law is designed to do exactly this.”And the group said it believed the powers would contravene human rights laws because “only those who live in rented accommodation will ever be at the mercy of this power”.The scheme is part of the Integrated Gangs strategy, under which the politan police work with council teams, including psychologists, probation workers and social workers, to try to stop people getting involved with gangs.Supt Nick Davies, the police commander in an area of north London in which at least 14 gangs reportedly operate, has said the power to threaten whole families in which a single member is linked to gangs “seems to be a particularly effective strategy in changing the behaviour” of the gang members. In an interview with the Sunday Times earlier this month, he insisted the “threshold for eviction is high”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2455c579251e7b31105364704168816e373d76e7/71_378_4812_2887/master/4812.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8c2be70dcdd6dd62db00ab49c8acd88","title":"sam burgess england rugby league denver","story":"• England face New Zealand at Mile High Stadium• Burgess calls on England to do the sport justice in AmericaSam Burgess urged his England teammates to “do the sport justice” when they face New Zealand on Saturday in a Denver showcase for international rugby league.Burgess and several NRL-based teammates took a public stance to support the game going ahead after Australian clubs raised concerns over player welfare and the match being played at high altitude. With a World Cup in the US seven years away, Burgess says the players must ensure the game delivers on all levels.“I think it’s been worth making a stand for looking back, but we’ll see for real after the game,” Burgess said. “The result is the most important thing for us but putting on a good game and showcasing what we believe to be the greatest sport in the world on American soil is another challenge. There will always be people who doubt what we’re trying to do but it’s been a success so far.”A deal has been agreed in principle for England and the Kiwis to return to the US in 2019 and 2020 depending on the success of this weekend. With a crowd of more than 20,000 expected to watch the game at Mile High Stadium, Burgess said he has seen a lot of interest from the Denver public.“Walking around the streets of Denver, people are talking about it,” said Burgess, who has been heavily involved in promotion of the game. “I guess the big test will be the fans who come through the door. Denver is a huge sporting city and there seems to be a buzz about it in town – hopefully we do the sport justice.”The game is England’s first since defeat in the World Cup final last year, and with a three-Test series against New Zealand to come on home soil this year Burgess says this weekend is key to ensure Wayne Bennett’s side continue to develop as a group.“It’s a chance to have another week together in camp and, in the long run, that helps,” Burgess said. “We want to be competing at the very top of world rugby and for that to happen we need to be playing together as often as possible.”Jamie Ellis slotted over a last-minute drop goal to give a patched-up Castleford a dramatic 19-18 victory over top-four rivals Wigan on Friday night. The Tigers have managed to keep pace with Wigan despite their injury crisis and they moved to within a point of the Warriors after edging a thrilling Super League clash at the Mend-A-Hose Jungle. Wigan, who were also depleted by injuries as well as England call-ups, took a 12-4 lead into half-time thanks to tries from Sam Tomkins and Liam Marshall either side of a Quentin Laulu-Togaga’e effort. But Castleford came storming back and were on course for a memorable win after Michael Shenton and Matt Cook went over. Cook went from hero to villain when he was sin-binned and Tom Davies scored in the next set but Ellis made sure his yellow card was not too costly to send Castleford five points clear of fifth-placed Hull.

For Jacques Laffite, the race’s return to the Formula One calendar after a 10-year absence and at the Paul Ricard circuit has special resonance. A pleasure amplified by the joie de vivre the former F1 driver derives from Lewis Hamilton’s performances.France hosted the first grand prix in 1906 and had held 86 further meetings by its last race in 2008 at Magny-Cours. Unsurprisingly a decade on there is a celebratory air at Paul Ricard, which hosted the race 14 times between 1971 and 1990. Laffite knows it well, as the charismatic 74-year-old raced at the track in his heyday when driving for Ligier, taking six wins.In the 70s and early 80s, Laffite and France were synonymous. His French team, running in the country’s traditional blue colour, also sported that most Gallic of cigarette sponsors, Gitanes. Laffite retired in 1986 when Alain Prost was in his pomp, having already taken two of his four titles, and the French Grand Prix was a meeting whose future never looked in doubt.Laffite was an F1 commentator for France’s TF1 when the race was last hosted and he believes its resurrection is of real importance. “The people have missed it,” he says. “We have been waiting for 10 years, the French Grand Prix was one of the best in the world for a long time. We love F1 here, its return is good for everybody, especially for France and especially at Paul Ricard.”He took his and Ligier’s first GP win at the 1976 Swedish Grand Prix and stresses how important it was for him to be racing for a French team. At the next round, his home race in Dijon, he and the team realised they had made their mark.“There were so many people that turned up they did not have enough tickets to sell,” he says. “It is stressful but I love it, to race in my country. It felt like a real home race, especially with Ligier, and Gitanes in a French blue car. It was fun to see all these people supporting us.”He rates one of his best performances at home as his run at Ricard in 1980. He had claimed pole with a superb lap but, although leading for much of the race, could manage only third after his tyres went off. He is still fond of the circuit, which is using its classic configuration this weekend, and pleased it is hosting the return for the French GP.Perhaps most intriguingly he is looking forward to how Hamilton takes to the challenge. “He is my favourite driver,” he says. “Hamilton is more of a fighter than Sebastian Vettel. When you need it he is able to do something incredible with the car. Vettel is really competitive but is not taking as many risks compared to Hamilton. Hamilton is able to just do things better than Vettel.”It is Vettel, however, who leads Hamilton by one point after a 15-point swing in the Ferrari driver’s favour at the previous grand prix in Canada but the world champion topped the timesheets in both practice sessions on Friday.Hamilton was 0.704sec quicker than Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo in second practice, while Vettel was only fifth fastest. The session included a 10-minute red flag period, caused when Sergio Pérez’s Force India lost a wheel at 150mph on the Mistral straight.Mercedes have fitted an upgraded, new specification engine and will expect to match and even better the step forward Ferrari made with their upgrade in Montreal.For McLaren the pressure to perform has proved testing already in France, especially for the racing director, Éric Boullier, who faced stern questions about his future with the team. Hoping to fight for podiums this season, the car has not been the step forward that was expected. Fernando Alonso’s fifth in Australia has been their best result.Boullier had to defend himself after reports of deep unrest in the team and that McLaren had given out 25p chocolate bars as a bonus to staff, one of whom reportedly described the atmosphere as “toxic” and that Boullier and other management figures were seen as “untouchable”.Boullier dismissed the affair as “chocolate-gate”, perpetrated by employees he described as merely “a couple of people who are grumpy”.He also insisted he would not be leaving. “We are all responsible for the car performance. No, I will not resign,” he said. “I’m in my 20th year in racing, I’ve won races and championships with every team I’ve managed before, including Formula One, so this is some record you cannot take away from me.”However while Boullier eventually tired of discussion of the topic he did throw doubt on McLaren’s expectations. The team had switched to Honda engines in 2015 in the belief they needed a works partnership to win. They dropped the manufacturer for Renault after three woeful seasons but Boullier suggested the former relationship was required to challenge at the top.“Red Bull is the proof that you can win races as a customer,” he said. “I think winning a championship is another level, you need to have a works team status.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b2e9c4b7bdced3b47c685792ab544fb6d1af71b/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40e8d1e7af92eb5e0ca611ce06bd958d","title":"royal ascot horse racing dress code","story":"The logic reveals itself only slowly but Royal Ascot’s ability to host the best thoroughbred racing in the world comes because of its baffling dress code not in spite of itOne of the charms of Royal Ascot is that, uniquely among British race meetings, the races are never sponsored. And thus their traditional and often picturesque names – the Gold Cup, the Royal Hunt Cup, the King’s Stand Stakes – continue uncluttered by the commands of commerce.However, not everything is unsponsored. The 2018 Ascot “style guide” is produced “in association with Cunard”. And one can see why a company might want a piece of this particular action. It is a riveting document.Participants often have to think about dress codes at sporting events: jockeys normally change their outfit between every race consider the “almost entirely white” rule at Wimbledon. But this rarely impinges on spectators. Jackets and ties are compulsory in the Lord’s pavilion. But mostly you pay your money and you wear your choice.Not at Ascot. The code for this year’s five-day meeting, which concludes on Saturday, goes into infinite detail about what may and may not be worn in each part of the racecourse. In the Royal Enclosure, gentlemen must wear black or grey morning dress waistcoat and tie (no cravats) black or grey top hats black shoes. Socks became compulsory this year.The rules for women are even more complex and changeable. “Dresses and skirts should be of modest length” “headpieces” may be worn in place of hats provided they have a solid base of four inches or more jumpsuits are now allowed but bardot straps have been banned. It is hard to imagine any other racecourse employing someone who even knows what bardot straps might be, never mind banning them.In the outer areas the rules are gradually relaxed until, for the Windsor Enclosure, the cheapest part beyond the two-furlong pole, there are no requirements, merely requests and recommendations. The style guide concludes with a general warning that “fancy dress” is not allowed.Who writes this stuff? Morning coats were invented by Beau Brummell 200 years ago. Ascot week 2018 has been unusually temperate. Mostly, it is either hot or wet. Either way, the garb is impractical and uncomfortable. What is all this if not fancy dress?It’s easy to mock – and thus miss the point. “Tradition is absolutely everything at Royal Ascot,” an ITV commentator explained. That misses the point, too. Listen: this is the best race meeting in the world. Epsom Cheltenham Longchamp Kentucky Melbourne … there is no feast of high-quality thoroughbred racing to match this one. The logic reveals itself only slowly. Its success comes because of the dress code not in spite of it.The racegoers like seeing the Queen they quite like the horses, though in most cases not obsessively. But they adore dressing up. And they will pay enough for the opportunity to fund the prize money that makes the racing so good. That, not tradition, is absolutely everything.Thursday was Ladies’ Day, a tradition – or marketing device – that dates back to at least 1823. Lately most of Britain’s racecourses have joined in and staged their own. “I was at Chester Ladies’ Day last month,” I heard someone say. “That was messy. Very messy.” This was pretty messy too, from an early stage. Two young women on my train were three-quarters cut on some nasty‑looking pink stuff (to match their outfits) shortly after 10am.The route from Ascot station is uphill along a dedicated walkway, indifferently maintained like most British pavements, and treacherous in high heels. It works on the airline principle: veer right for the cheap seats, left for posh. But the poshness is part of the illusion: it is based, as on a plane, entirely on money. If you bought the clobber new, a day’s racing – counting travel, admission, lunch, tea and everything else – could easily cost £1,000 before having a bet.The Royal Enclosure is not one space but a variety of separate sanctuaries, like side chapels in a cathedral. Everyone wears nametags. I kept glancing to spot a famous name but I never found one. In any case it is said the tags do not always refer to the person wearing them. And if the people in the Royal Enclosure were the kind of people who used to go into the Royal Enclosure, they would not come out of the Royal Enclosure to have their pictures taken in front of the sign saying Royal Enclosure, would they? I suppose the rot began in 1955 when orcees were unbanned, which is lucky given the current state of the royal family.And the policing is less intrusive than it was. I never spotted anyone being upbraided for wearing a headpiece with a base of less than four inches. And the entrances are guarded less fiercely. There are still a few men in bowler hats, the last remnants of the once-mighty class of former army sergeants who used to leave the parade grounds to join the National Union of Jobsworths. And even some of them were smiling.I went on a long wander up the course to the Windsor. This came as a surprise. For a start it has become very multi-ethnic, which I had not seen before on a British racecourse. Despite there being only requests and recommendations, the women were more elegant here, in their demeanour as well as their dresses. What’s the appeal, I asked one regular, Patricia Welsh, from Ealing via Grenada. “It’s the Queen. And I love to see the dresses and the hats. I get some good ideas. And I like the horses, too.”But the horses are hardly visible out here. Indeed, for everyone denied admission to the upper reaches of the Dubai-sized airline terminal that now functions as the main stand, Ascot is a lousy place to watch horse racing. It has improved since 2006, when the new stand opened and people trying to watch the first race from the ground-level steps discovered it was invisible.The news took some time to permeate upwards and much longer before the double-barrelled functionary deemed responsible for this expensive fiasco was taken to the Tower and drowned in a butt of Dom Pérignon. But, to be honest, only a minority were that bothered.Back near the Royal Enclosure the place only really came alive after racing when the sing-song began round the bandstand. Union jacks were distributed. And we had just about every song-turned-cliche dating back to Beau Brummell, from Maybe It’s Because I’m A Londoner to Delilah and My Way. It was like karaoke night at the Bag O’Nails.By now, “Regrets, I’ve had a few” was appropriate in more ways than one. I asked a paramedic if it had been busy. “Yes, it has.” “The usual cause?” “Yes,” he sighed. “The usual.” The walk downhill to the station was more fraught than uphill. Stilettos had to be removed. I passed one woman, pissed in pink, being half-carried.But by golly, they had all had fun. Royal Ascot is sheer genius. How did a country that can come up with such a brilliantly counterintuitive way of spreading happiness get itself into such a mess?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fa239bab935d22403b2d4995a73b4fdb892ee7b/120_0_1801_1081/master/1801.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a7baabcda1b2e449b86c9b1a58e5d04","title":"saturdays best tv hidden the great exhibition of the north","story":"The gloomy but accomplished Welsh psychological thriller continues and the BBC’s coverage of the Northern exhibition programme gets underwayThe slate skies and desolate moors of north Wales provide a suitably unsettling backdrop for this excellent bilingual psychological thriller.

So if you’re looking for counterculture sounds, it’s here you’ll find songs that spoke for a generationImmersion in Seattle’s music scene begins minutes after disembarking at Sea-Tac, the city’s international airport, which houses a store devoted to the record company Sub Pop. In 1988, the then shoestring Sub Pop Records released Nirvana’s debut single it subsequently became as synonymous with Seattle as Motown is with Detroit. Opening our hipster playlist is Nirvana’s fourth single, Smells Like Teen Spirit, released three years later. It became a massive hit across the world, igniting the rock phenomenon that would transform Seattle, a hitherto obscure enclave in America’s far north-west, into an epicentre of cool.Previous generations of Seattle musicians took for granted that they would have to leave their hometown if they wanted a successful career. Arguably the greatest electric guitarist of all-time, Jimi Hendrix is up next – he was born and raised in Seattle, although only found fame after moving to London.Right now, Seattle’s music has never been so rich or erse. Witness the contrast of Fleet Foxes’ Sun it Rises, a yearning choral-Americana hymn to frontier spirits, with avant-hip-hop duo Shabazz Palaces. Shine a Light hails from their futuristic twin Quazarz album – released in 2017 by a certain indie record label with its own airport shop.Portland has become renowned in recent years for its ultra-progressive attitudes – as satirised by the comedy series Portlandia – but the city’s hippy roots have long attracted free-thinkers from all over America. Emerging from the city’s early 90s underground rock scene with his disarmingly catchy dark-folk confessionals was Elliott Smith. Here, we trace the Texan native’s troubled quest around Portland in Needle in the Hay.Other musicians who rocked up in Portland included feminist trio Sleater-Kinney, formed in the Washington state capital Olympia during the mid-90s, by guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, alongside drummer Janet Weiss. From their 2015 comeback album, No Cities to Love confounds the adage that radical voices mellow with age – or, in the case of Portlandia co-creator Brownstein, fame.Next up, we have the Shins, who formed in New Mexico but became Portland residents following their 2002 breakthrough hit New Slang (as featured in the film Garden State). Then, Laura Veirs – who was called to the city via Colorado and the midwest to craft her contemplative modern-folk tapestries – offers a revelatory version of the Grateful Dead song Mountains of the Moon, from her latest album the Lookout.The Grateful Dead were, of course, a flagship band for 60s counterculture. From San Fran, tremors from the Summer of Love rippled up the west coast of the US – and then around the world. While the Dead were busy soundtracking Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests, the 1967 Haight-Ashbury scene’s commercial powerhouse was Jefferson Airplane, a relatively straightforward folk-rock band until the recruitment of siren vocalist Grace Slick. Her vocals on White Rabbit – with its exhortation to “feed your head” – alongside other songs, such as Somebody to Love, helped the tracks become anthems for the ages.A decade later, the punk revolution was under way, and San Francisco’s North Beach district harboured the latest manifestation of the city’s nonconformist heritage: the Dead Kennedys. They deployed caustic satire in songs like California Über Alles to debunk mainstream American culture and politics.Our penultimate track is Why Won’t You Stay, by one of San Francisco’s greatest songwriters, Mark Eitzel, chronicler of the city’s luckless and heartbroken for the past 30 years – both with legendary band American Music Club, notably on Everclear (Rolling Stone’s Best Album of 1991), and in his more recent solo work. Eitzel’s lachrymose voice is the perfect accompaniment to a Mission bar crawl.Carrying the city’s freak flag proudly into the present day to round off our playlist are Thee Oh Sees, a twin-drummer psychedelic juggernaut led by wild-eyed John Dwyer – proof that San Fran isn’t merely a place, it’s also a state of mind.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15e934a6d937f2e5c57a19d831f15803a7d337ae/0_466_8660_5196/master/8660.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73b1e8f895372e1b53341465ae4aef8b","title":"boris becker insists diplomatic passport is genuine","story":"Former tennis star says he received document from Central African Republic’s ambassadorFormer world No 1 tennis player Boris Becker has insisted he has a genuine diplomatic passport from the Central African Republic after officials dismissed it as a fake.The retired German tennis star, who claims his role as an attache to the EU gives him diplomatic immunity from bankruptcy proceedings in the UK, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “I have received this passport from the ambassador.

But it turned into a two-week nightmare after Cedella Roman accidentally veered across the US border and was seized by US border patrol agents.The French citizen was visiting her mother and studying English, when the family headed to White Rock, about an hour’s drive from Vancouver in May. As dusk approached, the 19-year-old went for a jog along the beach. She swerved on to a dirt path as the tide came in, stopping briefly to snap a photo of the stunning scenery before turning around to retrace her steps.It was then that she was confronted by two officers from the US border patrol.“An officer stopped me and started telling me I had crossed the border illegally,” Roman told Radio-Canada. “I told him I hadn’t done it on purpose, and that I didn’t understand what was happening.” She hadn’t seen any signs marking the border, she said. “I said to myself, well I may have crossed the border but they’ll probably only give me a fine, or they’ll tell me to go back to Canada or they’ll give me a warning.”Complicating matters was the fact that she didn’t have any government-issued ID or travel permits on her at the time. Noting that her steps had been captured on security cameras monitoring the area, the officers detained the teenager and accused her of crossing illegally into Blaine, Washington. She was transferred to the Tacoma Northwest Detention Centre, run by the Department of HomelandSecurity, more than 200km (125 miles) south of where she had been apprehended. Already the largest and most funded federal law enforcement agency in its own right, the border patrol is part of the umbrella agency US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). CBP’s approximately 60,000 employees are split in four major isions: officers who inspect imports an air and marine ision agents who staff ports of entry – international airports, seaports and land crossings and the approximately 20,000 agents of the border patrol, who are concentrated in the south-west, but stationed nationwide.The border patrol enjoys extraordinary police powers. Agents operate checkpoints where they stop motorists everyday without suspicion, and in the interior of the country up to 100 miles, they can board planes, trains and buses. There is no geographic limit to which agents can otherwise conduct stops amid roving patrols, though they are technically required to have reasonable suspicion to do so. Extending from not only land borders but also the Pacific, Atlantic, Gulf and Great Lakes coasts, the 100-mile zone encompasses two out of every three Americans, 12 states in their whole or near entirety and nine of the 10 biggest cities in the nation.“They put me in the caged vehicles and brought me into their facility,” said Roman. “They asked me to remove all my personal belongings with my jewelry. They searched me everywhere.” The gravity of the situation began to sink in. “I understood it was getting very serious and I started to cry a bit.”Roman was able to contact her mother from the centre. Christiane Ferne rushed to the facility in a panic, bringing with her Roman’s passport and study permits. It wasn’t enough staff at the centre said the documents would have to be validated by immigration authorities in Canada before they could release Roman, according to Ferne. Two weeks passed before immigration officials in Canada and the US were able to confirm that Roman was eligible to return to Canada. Throughout it all, Ferne visited her daughter regularly at the centre. “It was just unfair that there was nothing, no sign at the border,” said Ferne. “It’s like a trap … anybody can be caught at the border like this.” Documents issued by the US government and shared with Radio-Canada confirmed that Roman was discharged on 6 June. The family said they were not sure if Roman will be allowed back in the US.  Immigration officials on both sides of the nearly 9,000km border refused to comment on Roman’s case, pointing to concerns over privacy. In a statement, US Customs and Border Protection noted that anyone who enters the US outside an official port of entry is considered to have crossed the border illegally. “This applies regardless of whether or not the inidual claims to have inadvertently crossed the border,” the department added.

In what is now turning into a battle of words between the US government and international observers, Alston hit back at criticisms that had been leveled at him the previous day by Nikki Haley, US ambassador to the UN.Haley complained that it was “patently ridiculous for the United Nations to examine poverty in America”. She accused the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights of political bias and wasting UN money by carrying out a six-month investigation into poverty and inequality in America, saying he should have focused instead on countries like Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo.Addressing delegations from 46 countries gathered in the chamber of the human rights council, Alston fired back that “when one of the world’s wealthiest countries does very little about the fact that 40 million of its citizens live in poverty, it is entirely appropriate for the reasons to be scrutinized”. He said that the “massive tax cuts” promoted by Trump would “overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy” while other policies pursued by the US government would stigmatize and punish millions of low-income Americans.In his most caustic comment, Alston threw back at Haley a term that she herself had used to deride the UN human rights council as a “cesspool of political bias”. Alston said that same council that he had seen with his own eyes real cesspools ­– in Alabama, during his tour of poverty hotspots in America.“I witnessed raw sewage poured into the gardens of people who could never afford to pay $30,000 for their own septic systems.” He added poignantly: “Cesspools need to be cleaned up, and governments need to act.”Such criticism of the world’s most powerful nation was all the more striking given the absence in the room. That morning, the chair normally occupied by the US delegation to the human rights council in Geneva was removed from the chamber following the decision of the Trump administration on Tuesday to withdraw from membership.The departure of the US makes it the only country to have pulled out of the world entity since the council was founded in 2006.Haley said the decision to depart was motivated by anger over the council’s perceived anti-Israeli bias, and about the continued membership within the body of human rights abusers such as Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo. But there was also growing speculation over whether the timing of the withdrawal had anything to do with Alston’s deeply critical report on poverty in America.Ken Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, asked in a tweet: “Is it just a coincidence that the US withdraws from the UN Human Rights Council two days before it examines the Trump administration’s neglect of poverty in the United States?”Had the US delegation been present in the council for the hearing, they might have been forgiven for wincing at Alston’s presentation. He accused Haley of wanting to exempt the US from precisely the kind of international accountability over human rights that the Trump administration demanded for other countries.Turning to the findings of his tour of the US, he noted that maternal mortality rates among African Americans were now almost double those in Thailand. He cited new World Health Organisation data that shows that babies born in China today will live longer healthy lives than babies born in America.While accepting that the US economy was enjoying a period of growth, Alston said: “But the question is, who is benefiting. The benefits of economic growth are going overwhelmingly to the wealthy.”Most ominously, the UN monitor warned that the persistence of extreme poverty in the US would have a knock-on on the health of its democracy. He said such enduring problems “create ideal conditions for small elites to trample on the human rights of minorities, and sometimes even of majorities”.The warning was echoed by the ACLU, which told the human rights council that under Trump the US was suffering “the erosion of political participation. People living in poverty in the United States are being systematically deprived of their right to vote.”The ACLU’s Jennifer Turner referred to the more than 6 million Americans who have been disenfranchised as a result of felony convictions. One out of four African Americans in Kentucky, for instance, have been stripped of their votes as a result of felony disenfranchisement."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"RHI inquiry exposes DUP and NI\u0026rsquos civil service view of London money as fair gamePilot scheme offering evening transport service intended to ease rural isolationGarda\u0026iacute advise politicians on how best to assist staff in wake of rising threat from publicEvery county in the province has won the Ulster Final \u0026ndash every county except FermanaghHSE phones woman to apologise while she is getting post-cancer-treatment wig\u0026lsquoYou can\u0026rsquot impose, really, obligations on people who are only two weeks old\u0026rsquoMichael D Higgins indicates his desire to stand again ahead of formal announcementMick Barry urges Minister to introduce legislation to protect residents of Leeside apartmentsKeep elephants, children and the elderly well hydrated, warn the expertsConscience in the Catholic Church is supreme, above teachings of Pope and bishopsBoard commit to improving consistency in service following critical assessmentPsychological consequences of material differences impact the poor mostLawyer for Maurice McCabe say reporters have no basis for refusing to answer questionsThousands of customers affected by cancellations of trips due to be made on \u0026lsquoWB Yeats\u0026rsquoBritish-Irish Council summit in Guernsey hears of Irish resolve to intensify effortsJim and Orna Madden fined \u0026euro1,000 each for relabelling medicines imported from IndiaFines to be increased and legislation needs to be strengthened \u0026ndash Minister for EnvironmentGuilty plea follows burglary of room at Castleknock Hotel in Dublin last DecemberJob description says job being advertised when public confidence in health system needs strengthening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3540427.1529692734!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"long hot summer no end in sight to next week s heatwave","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMet Éireann’s definition of a heatwave is five consecutive days of maximum temperatures of 25 degrees and over for a given location.Temperatures will hit 24 degrees this weekend and then steadily rise into next week, reaching 28 degrees or more by Wednesday.

On Monday temperatures across most of Ireland will be 25 degrees and will not drop below more than 15 degrees during the night. Temperatures on Tuesday will start off at around 21 degrees from 10am and could reach 26 degrees by late afternoon. The warm, dry weather will hang around for the evening, dropping to 15 degrees by 10pm along the coast from Dublin to Cork. But temperatures along parts of the western coast such as Galway and Limerick could still be close to 23 degrees around the same time. Wednesday is set to be hotter still, with highest temperatures to hit 28 degrees in much of Leinster by 4pm. The rest of the country will not be far behind at 27 degrees, which will hold well into the evening before dropping to between 14 and 20 degrees that night. The next day will be similar, if not slightly hotter at 28 degrees or above. But coastal areas may be slightly cooler over the week due to stronger breezes. Met Éireann’s definition of a heatwave is five consecutive days of maximum temperatures of 25 degrees and over for a given location, which looks set to be met next week based on current forecasts. This data is taken from a new weather forecaster model on Met Éireann’s website, www.met.ie, which offers a guide to how the next week will shape up based on computer predictions.

Photograph: Toms KalninsEPAPresident Michael D Higgins has informed senior Government figures he is to seek a second term in office.The Government has provisionally set a date of October 26th for the vote, which will coincide with two referendums on the issue of blasphemy and the woman’s place in the home.The  understands Mr Higgins has indicated to a number of Cabinet Ministers his intention to stand again, ahead of a formal announcement next month.The President has given a number of statements in recent weeks hinting at his desire to secure another seven years in Áras an Uachtaráin and is said to have informed figures in Leinster House of his likely candidacy.Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has privately stated his party will not field a candidate in the presidential election, if one occurs.His party had passed a motion last year calling for it to participate in a contest. However, it is understood Mr Martin has told party figures it was his strong belief that there should not be a Fianna Fáil candidate on this occasion.As the incumbent, Mr Higgins can nominate himself for a second term but has the public support of several Cabinet Ministers including Shane Ross, Charlie Flanagan, Richard Bruton, Eoghan Murphy and Simon Harris.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he will wait until Mr Higgins publicly declares but believes there would be strong support for a second term.Mr Higgins had said during the 2011 presidential election campaign that he would only be a one-term President but comments in recent weeks have seen him shift from that position.Senator Gerard Craughwell is the only person to have confirmed he is seeking to run against Mr Higgins. Candidates require the signature of 20 Oireachtas members or four local authorities to sign his nomination papers.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said her party will field a candidate if there is a contest. However, Ms McDonald has insisted Sinn Féin is very supportive of Mr Higgins.A spokesman for the President declined to comment on whether Mr Higgins had informed Government of his intentions.He confirmed the President would “make his intentions known in early July”.The possibility of a presidential election was discussed at Cabinet in recent weeks when Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan sought approval to hold two referendums.Mr Flanagan has secured Cabinet approval to hold a vote on removing the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution and a separate one on deleting a constitutional clause on the place of the woman in a home.One Government source said: “There was talk about whether there would be one or not but nothing about Michael D’s intentions. There was one remark from a Minister, who shall not be named, who said the only person who could beat Michael D would be Daniel O’Donnell.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and

A senior civil servant recalled one of his EU colleagues remarking that Article 50 was written in such a way that only the British civil service would have a chance of getting it done in time.Which points to another lesson. Whoever was in charge of this process, whatever the size of their majority, doing Brexit would have been difficult, all-consuming and messy.And this is so not least because of the choice the EU has presented us with. Michel Barnier’s infamous steps of doom\u0026nbspmean there simply isn’t the room to arrive at the kind of ambitious free trade agreement of which the Prime Minister long dreamed. Rather, the Government must choose between three unpalatable options, or rather two unpalatable ones and an inconceivable one.Whether the Dominic Grieve amendment had passed last week or not, the Prime Minister now realises that no deal is not an option at all.Leaving us with two: a Brexit that is economically ruinous and one that, essentially, equates to membership without the perks.We must, in other words, choose between something that looks like the EU’s deal with Canada (though in all probability a Canada minus rather than a Canada plus) or something resembling continued membership of the single market and customs union.There isn’t much of a half-way house. All the clever talk of a partial single market for goods\u0026nbspis unrealistic. It would be complicated to manage, and does not really help even manufacturers. Rolls Royce, to use the most cited example, make a fair amount of their money from service\u0026nbspcontracts on their goods. Moreover, and not incidentally, the EU has not indicated it would accept anything along these lines.So back to the binary choice. Neither is perfect. Far from it. “Canada”\u0026nbsppresents economic problems. It would mean hardly any agreement over services – the bulk of our economy and the area where we enjoy a healthy surplus with the EU. And it will imply the need for customs checks at Dover. The Prime Minister herself implicitly recognised that such an outcome would be nowhere near good enough in her Mansion House speech.Equally, however, a straightforward “Norway”\u0026nbspsolution, with the UK unambiguously within the European Economic Area, is not one that would work politically here. So the question is whether something substantively similar can be dressed up as something sufficiently different – perhaps with registrations for EU nationals, a hyping up of the emergency brake on migration that the EEA treaty allows and stricter application of EU rules on free movement.This is where the debate now is. Find a clever way of selling the status quo, or adopt a model that impacts severely on trade and hence our economy, and deal with the political consequences.I, for one, have no earthly clue how this will play out. But as this stark choice becomes clearer, and as we approach squeaky bum time, the choice has to be made. Cabinet unity will be stretched to breaking point. Resignations seem inevitable as the PM is forced to do what she has so far refused to do: make a binding choice.And remember this is only a part of the story that has played out since 23 June 2016. The other is not about the EU, but about ourselves.Brexit is happening against the backdrop of a politics changing radically before our eyes. The traditional class bases of support for both major parties seem to be shifting. Hardly surprising then that neither the Tories nor Labour seem sure what post-Brexit offer to make to voters: neither is wholly certain which voters it is trying to attract.This political churn, combined with the all-consuming impact of Brexit on Whitehall, means that little if anything has been done to address the substantive domestic implications of the referendum. And this matters because it is here, rather than in Brussels, that the domestic political battle over Brexit will be won or lost.Whatever her subsequent errors as Prime Minister, Mrs May adeptly captured the mood of the country when she made that striking address from the doorstep of her new residence in Downing Street in July 2016.Brexit represented many things, not least a profound dissatisfaction with the political and economic status quo. Hence the real measure of its impact will not directly be what happens in negotiations with the EU, but how our Government decides to tackle this dissatisfaction. And of course the EU will no longer be there to provide cover for domestic policy failures.Certainly, something more substantive and less dishonest than the “Brexit idend”\u0026nbspfor the NHS is required. What that will be offered, as both major parties flounder, is anyone’s guess.And so, to the final lesson. There is a long, long way to go. We have reached the Brexit foothills. But the real mountains – sorting trade, then, more importantly, sorting ourselves – still await us.

I was really keen to be as transparent as possible.”She added: “As long as Ucas is absolutely open to changing the way it operates – and being transparent about the data – I think that’s actually a strength rather than detracting from our reputation.”Samuel Babarinde, a black prospective student who had his application flagged by Ucas, decided to withdraw his application after he found the investigation process “intimidating”.“I felt I had been singled out. It felt like I was already guilty before being found guilty,” Mr Babarinde previously told The Independent.Ms Marchant admitted communication with some prospective students could be improved – including the tone of staff in the admissions service.“Just because you’re flagged doesn’t mean we are going to cancel. So the tone in which you speak to people, or email people, needs to be fit for the 21st century. It’s got to be courteous,” she said.Ilyas Nagdee, black students’ officer at the National Union of Students (NUS), told The Independent\u0026nbspthey still had concerns about why black students are more likely to have university applications investigated than their white peers – and they are yet to hear how Ucas plans to address it.He said: “Ucas’ antidote needs to go beyond naval-gazing at the tone of voice of their staff, it needs to tackle systemic issues of unconscious bias which are hindering talented black students from entering and benefiting from higher education.”Student news in picturesSouth Korean policemen detain student protestors during a protest against South Korean President Park Geun-Hye outside the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea.Filipino demonstrators face off with anti-riot police during a protest near the US Embassy in Manila, PhilippineHundreds of protesters including Indigenous People, students and militant groups marched towards the US Embassy to protest against the presence of US military troops and condemning the violent dispersal which left at least forty people hurt including twenty police officers and three people who were run over by a police vanA federal judge in Mexico has ordered that a once-fugitive police chief be held on charges of kidnapping in the disappearance of 43 studentsA man holds up a photograph of a missing student with a caption reading \u0027We are missing 43,\u0027 during a meeting marking the 25-month anniversary of the disappearances of 43 students in the southern state of Guerrero, in Mexico City.

When I did, one asked:\u0026nbsp“Can we pray for you?”I asked why they wanted to pray for me, and the same person answered that they felt called by God to walk the streets of DC\u0026nbspand let God’s voice tell them who might be “broken” or otherwise need prayer.As a Christian, I’m opposed to neither prayer nor people praying specifically for me, at least not when it’s done in good faith.But I’m also a transgender woman, and I was dressed in gorgeous makeup and clothing and earrings. I sure caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer.My introduction to Christianity was in evangelical churches. For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces, where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople and women as often as I found warmhearted people eager to serve others.There was more than a little racism, too. I’ve heard the statement “I’ll pray for you” said with love, and with judgment and scorn. I know the difference, and the folks who confronted me outside the cafe were making their judgement clear.Instead of a theological debate that usually goes nowhere for lack of good faith in discussion, I wanted them to feel what it’s like to have someone supposedly approach in love but inflict pain and discomfort. Perhaps that’s what it takes. A forced perspective in empathy. Why not try that approach?I could have ignored them but I’ve had it with some evangelicals giving a bad name to their community by insisting on defining people’s humanity for them. These three assumed I was broken because of my gender identity. They saw the constellation of my personhood through a backward telescope.It angered me that the whole of my being could be reduced to their flawed understanding of LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople, a view that could easily be revised if only they would take the time to get to know me instead of assuming they already did.So I would be damned if I would let them interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn’t bothering them.I asked their spokeswoman if she understood how it might look to be searching for “broken” people to pray for, and specifically pick out a random transgender person. And they looked more than taken aback.I stood up, smiling but internally annoyed, and asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. Their eyes went wide. One guy stammered nervously, clearly having trouble answering the question.The other two were just as flummoxed, ambushed by the idea that the “broken” transgender person was asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew.For those who don’t know, Matthew is the first book in the New Testament and one of the three Synoptic Gospels, each of which are narratives of the life of Christ, frequently using the same stories, often with identical wording.While all three contain instruction on prayer, I reached for Matthew 18:20 because of its strong presence in the evangelical community and its common misapplication by members. In short, it reads: “For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.”Those up on their biblical knowledge might wonder why I didn’t turn to Matthew 6:5-7, scathing verses that call out hypocrites who are performative in their Christianity, telling them to pray in private rather than out on the streets so that they might be seen by others.It’s a good one that, unsurprisingly, is ignored in evangelical circles. They know it’s there, but it’s inconvenient.The verse I selected hits hard instead because it’s so commonly heard before a group prayer in evangelical churches. There, it tends to be inaccurately interpreted as a numbers game, one that’s about bringing to fruition what is requested of God in prayer.Evangelicals think of it as a call to bring more people into the church or, more cynically, personal prosperity through the Gospel.In reality, it’s a verse on accountability before God and about how God may work that accountability through humans. As Leisa Baysinger notes on the blog Our Ancient Paths, it references earlier Jewish tradition that at least three witnesses must agree to bring judgement on someone.In the moment I was unaware of its exact roots, which were surprisingly apt given the attempt of this small band to sit in judgement of me, but I still understood what was at stake in the line, and I loved the idea of using a verse on accountability that they had probably misunderstood numerous times.I was the judged who understands the law better than those attempting to judge, and on that day I sought to bring accountability.These aren’t issues I take lightly, and the passive-aggressive condescension of these three was anything but harmless. This wasn’t the time to be polite.Not when the Trump-Pence White House is trying to ban transgender people from the military. Not when transgender students with stories of discrimination are turned away by the US\u0026nbspDepartment of Education.Not when President Donald Trump and vice president\u0026nbspMike Pence\u0026nbspare seeking to implement a Health and Human Services Department regulation allowing healthcare workers to deny potentially lifesaving treatment to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.Not when the Human Rights Campaign reports that in the US, eight transgender people have been killed in 2018 and 28 in 2017 –\u0026nbspthe most ever annually. I wasn’t going to be silent.Instead, I spoke.“You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus’ name, there he is with us?”They stared at me blankly. I had no intention of going easy on them.“That is what Matthew says, is it not?”At last, one spoke up: “Yes, that’s right.”And they nervously stepped forward into a circle.I said to one:\u0026nbsp“You start us off.” And she did, going through the motions quickly and antiseptically because they clearly wanted to get as far as they could from this awkward situation. And then I picked it up when it was clear she was done.“Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends,” I began, wholly honest with God about how I hoped she would bless my new friends, encouraging them to affirm and be inclusive of others. I was hopeful that their community would honour all as God made them and value the strength of ersity.I mentioned the natural beauty of the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and thanked God again for making us as we are, throwing in a genuine wish that their trip back home would be a safe one.Then, knowing my audience, I wrapped up with the usual evangelical banal phraseology –\u0026nbsp“no weapons shall be formed against them”,\u0026nbsp“put God on their hearts” –\u0026nbspto let them know I was just as familiar with their community’s vernacular as they were, maybe more so.As I finished, having returned their “let us pray for you” to them tenfold, they murmured their thank you’s and scuttled away.I don’t know whether my words made it through, but I hope they have a sense of what it feels like to have a stranger impose self-righteous venom on them. I also hope that they’ll realise how much actions such as these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.A prayer that one might change their sexuality or gender identity is egregious encouragement to those who would seek to discriminate against LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople in our laws and to do violence against them in our communities. My own prayer’s acidity served to make them aware of their own by way of spiritual inoculation.The Genderquake debate did more harm than good for transgender peopleWhy has Caitlyn Jenner been chosen to speak about ‘ersity’?These people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I’m confident that’s not how Jesus would go about it.There are many in the evangelical community who love and affirm their LGBT+\u0026nbspfamily, friends and fellow human beings.It’s unfortunate, then, that others in the community still must be told a simple truth: They are not doing the Lord’s work by politicising prayer at the expense of others or by dumping their misplaced condescension on strangers they believe to be broken.Prayer should be a loving act, not a weapon of marginalisation.Clymer ia a transgender woman,\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspArmy veteran and\u0026nbsppress secretary at the Human Rights Campaign\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But its implications are huge, and therefore have never been tested fully.Despite that, scientists rely on it to explain the strange behaviour of our universe. The new study shows that they haven\u0027t been wrong to do so.For instance, scientists have known since 1929 that the universe is expanding, but in 1998 found that the expansion had sped up and was going more quickly than it did in the past. That can only make sense if the universe is filled with a mysterious substance called dark energy – but that in turn relies on GR being correct at the scale of galaxies.As such, our very understanding of the universe relies on GR being correct.To check that, a team of astronomers looked deep into space, using\u0026nbspa nearby galaxy as a gravitational lens. That allowed them to test gravity at the astronomical scale.General Relativity predicts that massive objects deform space-time, this means that when light passes near another galaxy the light\u0027s path is deflected, said\u0026nbspThomas Collett of the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth, who led the study.\u0026nbspIf two galaxies are aligned along our line of sight this can give rise to a phenomenon, called strong gravitational lensing, where we see multiple images of the background galaxy.If we know the mass of the foreground galaxy, then the amount of separation between the multiple images tells us if General Relativity is the correct theory of gravity on galactic scales.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The ancient grave also contained the skeletons of leopards, lynx,\u0026nbspbears, cranes and domestic animals.The creatures interred in the\u0026nbsptomb are thought to\u0026nbsphave belonged to Lady Xia, grandmother of the nation’s first emperor, Qin Shi Huang.Naming their find Junzi imperialis, the scientists said the discovery is particularly noteworthy given the total lack of gibbons in the region today.Dr Samuel Turvey, a conservation biologist at the Zoological Society of London who made the discovery, told Science magazine that accounts of gibbons in central China are confined to the history books.“It is very, very far from any gibbon populations today,” he said.Dr Turvey came across the gibbon remains, which were first unearthed in 2004, while visiting the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archaeology in Xi’an.British mammals’ fight for survivalThe Mammal Society’s assessment of Britain’s mammal populations is the first such review in over 20 years. The results reveal winners and losers, and highlight some of the key threat’s facing the country’s wildlife such as habitat loss, invasive species and the spread of diseases.Only one of these flying mammals has been recorded in the whole country, in a railway tunnel in West SussexThough not generally considered threatened animals, black rats number have collapsed in recent years due largely to pest control measures. However their far more common cousins, the brown rats, are thriving.Though it is difficult to measure changes in squirrel numbers,  their range has shrunk considerably due largely to the spread of squirrel pox virus by invasive grey squirrelThere has been a marked decline in wildcat populations, with only around 200 left in ScotlandThe banning of persistent organic pesticides has had a positive population effect on ottersThe 2018 review estimates a population size of fallow deer almost three times the size of that estimated in the 1995 review – a positive trend that is seen in other deer species.These aquatic mammals were nearly extinct in Europe at the start of the 20th century, but their reintroduction to the UK have been largely successfulThe Mammal Society’s assessment of Britain’s mammal populations is the first such review in over 20 years.

Its discovery was documented in the journal Science.Dr Thomas Geissmann, a gibbon expert at the University of Zurich, said the skull is a “fantastic find”, and could be the first evidence of many more gibbon species that used to inhabit this part of China.“I don’t doubt for a second that it’s a new species, and probably a new genus,” he said.Historical accounts and artwork from ancient China are full of references to gibbons, and could help scientists understand what the ape looked like when it was alive.Despite the reverence the ancient Chinese gave to these primates, it is likely that human expansion into the region’s expansive forests during this period spelled the end for its gibbon inhabitants.As forests are felled and agriculture expands, the gibbons’ habitat was probably whittled away, and the onset of a cooler, drier climate in central China at this time could have added to the pressure on its apes.Similar pressures still face gibbons today. In China, two species of these primates have disappeared recently, and the surviving representatives of the group are critically endangered.Scientists have warned that around 60 per cent of all primate species globally are threatened with extinction, including chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans.The Hainan gibbon, which inhabits the Chinese island it takes its name from, may be the rarest mammal in the world – with only around 26 iniduals remaining. The pressures facing these apes are similar to those that seemingly faced their ancient central Chinese cousins – human activity and habitat destruction.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I think that everybody here is optimistic that we will see that.From Sunday we are going to get an injection of air coming in from central Europe and that combined with the home grown warmth mean we could see temperatures getting above 29.1C, we may see a 30C.The next five days are set to be dry and sunny, and should feel fresher.The Met Office predictions for the coming days are:Friday: Dry and fine with warm sunshine for most, although a little cloudier in the west. Cloudier and cooler in the far north with some light rain possible at times.Saturday: Dry, fine weather with plenty of warm sunshine. Highs of around 24C.Sunday to Tuesday: Generally fine, dry with plenty of warm or very warm sunshine, turning warmer each day. Across the far north it will be cloudier and cooler, with patchy rain and stronger winds at times.The World Meteorological Organisation definition of a heatwave is when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5C, the normal period being 1961-1990.They are most common in summer when high pressure develops across an area.High-pressure systems are slow moving and can persist over an area for a prolonged period of time such as days or weeks.They can occur in the UK due to the location of the jet stream, which is usually to the north of the UK in the summer.This can allow high pressure to develop over the UK resulting in persistent dry and settled weather.The scorching summer of 1976 was the hottest summer since records began.It led to a severe drought owing to the exceptionally dry conditions, although it is thought that 1995 was drier.In the summer of 1976, Heathrow had 16 consecutive days over 30C from June 23 to July 8, and for 15 consecutive days from June 23 to July 7 temperatures reached 32.2C somewhere in England.But the single hottest temperature of 38.5C was set on August 10, 2003.When the mercury shoots up there are several obvious precautions to take.It is advised to make sure you drink a lot of water to make sure you stay hydrated during the hot spell.Keeping a bottle of sunscreen with you to soak up those UV rays is also highly advisable as is ensuring you have a hat to prevent sunstroke."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000414850013.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may brexit vote trevor kavanagh","story":"She won a crucial vote on Brexit, but only after giving embittered anti-Brexit Speaker John Bercow a final say on Parliament’s right to veto the whole deal.This may be a procedural technicality, but it is still madness.She is now careering from one self-inflicted crisis to the next, assailed by the Remainers she truly supports but held on two feet by Brexiters who cannot allow her to fall . . . yet.This zombie Government is kept on life support not by fellow Remainers but by true Brexit believers who want her to carry the can.This cannot last.

Shes a remarkable woman. Were moving forward and hopefully going to get married next year. The children are really happy.The dad-of-two heard everything as wife Nicola was tragically stabbed to death by a schizophrenic home invader as she protected their kids Stanley, six, and Isabella, three.Mr Cross, an IT specialist, was working away from home at the time and 200 miles away in Hull when, during a phone call with Nicola, he heard her desperate fight for life.He appeared on the latest series of Channel 4s SAS: Who Dares Wins, in which ex-Special Forces soldiers put recruits through a gruelling recreation of the SAS selection process.The 40-year-old had ex-Special Forces hardmen Jason Fox and Ant Middleton in tearful silence as he revealed the harrowing details of that night.Marcin Porczynski, then 27 and a schizophrenic, broke into the familys home late at night intending to kidnap their two young children while Mr Cross was working in Hull.Reliving the night of his wifes death, he said today: Nikki just called me late in the evening and said she was worried about somebody outside the house and the police had been earlier.The children were in bed at the time, Stanley was six and Isabella was three. So we were discussing options on the phone, what to do. But before she could do anything, the guy broke in through the back doors and killed her.I heard it all down the phone. Its complete shock, you dont know whats going on. I felt utterly heartless. I was on the phone to the police on the other line, trying to relay information.I didnt know what had happened to the children till I heard them crying on the phone and then I thought they were OK.Mr Cross said after the killing he and his two kids moved in with his parents but he returned to his former home occasionally so he could let out his emotions in private.He underwent trauma counselling afterwards and said he experienced flash backs within the first month after Nicola died.I felt like I couldnt breathe, I was back in that moment and then I realised if Im going to be a good dad to the kids and make sure theyre confident, happy adults then I need to get help, he said.In January this year Mr Cross revealed he was doing really well and had found love again with 27-year-old Alex.Discussing his new relationship he said: She came in and sort of let everything wash over her. Its a brave decision to get involved with a family thats had something like that happen to them.Shes been perfect with the children. [In her job] she specialises in under fives but she can do things with the kids, techniques and things, that I dont know anything about.Its been amazing, quite freaky really, to have someone come in whos so perfect.Porczynski pleaded guilty at St Albans Crown Court in December 2016 to Nikkis manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was ordered to be detained in a secure psychiatric unit for an indefinite period.The court heard he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attack and had been hearing voices for up to two years before the killing.Got a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun or call us direct on 02077824220.We pay for videos too.

the jockey, who was suspended and fined £4,300 for using his whip above the permitted level from approaching two furlongs out during his winning race.The Duke and Duchess had caused a sensation when they arrived at the event earlier this week.The newlyweds arrived in a horse-drawn carriage alongside the Count and Countess of Wessex.They were followed swiftly by the Queen, wearing a bright yellow jacket and matching hat, who was accompanied by her daughter, Princess Anne.Meghan, wearing a elegant white dress and Harry in top and tails, waved to excited crowds who had packed out the race course in Berkshire.Their appearance at the eagerly anticipated race event came hours after Kensington Palace announced that their first official foreign trip as a couple would be to Dublin, in July. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were also spotted arriving at Royal Ascot with Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice travelling in another carriage, after.Missing from the royal party was Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall, who announced the birth of their second child earlier that day.Armed cops had been seen patrolling the race tracks bars and enclosures.Recent race days have been marred by unsavoury booze-fuelled antics, with video footage emerging of a mass brawl between men at Ascot in May.The incident took place a week after another man was filmed being kicked in the head during a fight at Goodwood races in Sussex.Goodwood chiefs are so sick of the bad behaviour that they have limited punters to buying fours drinks one time.However, it is not thought that Ascot has taken similar measures. Meghan has appeared comfortable in filling her new role as a royal, having taken on her first event without Prince Harry.The American visited Cheshire with The Queen earlier this month,

decapitated remains in the back garden","story":"Terrelle Johnson, 29, is said to have admitted killing mother Sherry after her decapitated body was found in their back garden in Stone County, Mississippi.Capt. Ray Boggs of the Stone County Sheriff’s Department recounted what was said at a preliminary hearing on Wednesday .According to the Sun Herald, he said: “(Johnson) told me that he beat her up real bad.“He said it got out of hand.”Using a butter knife, Johnson allegedly sliced his mother’s throat and then used his teeth and bare hands to remove her head, claimed Boggs.Johnson also claimed he choked her unconscious first during a fight over credit cards.When cops arrived at the Johnson home June 6 — to conduct a welfare check on Sherry at the request of her two brothers and sister, who hadn’t heard from the 51-year-old since June 3 — they found her mutilated body in the garden.Her head had been tossed over a fence.Johnson — an Army vet who was expelled by the Department of Veterans Affairs after a prior arrest — allegedly confessed to everything, though it’s unclear when his mother’s murder took place.A grand jury must now decide whether he should be formally charged.Johnson’s lawyer, Jim Davis, told reporters that he is currently weighing the possibility of an insanity defence.He said: “(Johnson) does have a substantial history and you all heard details of the case.“That’s not a normal homicide … (but) we’ve got to wait until we get the records and probably have him properly evaluated.“Then, we’ll kind of know where we’re headed.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000415382034.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"st pauls girls school hammersmith london austerity day baked potato lunch","story":"St Pauls Girls School in Hammersmith, West London, was accused by a former pupil of showing utter contempt with the exercise that resulted in money going to local charities.The prestigious school, which counts Susanna Reid and Rachel Weisz as former pupils, usually serves the likes of seared cod, slow-cooked Moroccan lamb and duck leg confit, appeared to delete a post on Twitter about the austerity lunch.The post, which was screen-grabbed and shared, said: Today was the final Austerity Day of the year.Students and staff had baked potatoes, with beans and coleslaw, for lunch, with fruit for dessert.The money saved will be donated to the schools charities.The post included pictures of the food described, as well as an image of what appears to be the arm of a butler or waiter lifting a lid from a platter containing just three peas.Henna Shah, 24, a former bursary student at the school, said: I am incredibly grateful to have gone to a school that has given me opportunities someone like me would never have had otherwise.Yet I recognise that few people like me get the chance to have an education like this on a bursary scheme like I did.I am highlighting this now because this is not about pulling the ladder up behind me - I joined the Labour party and work in politics now precisely because everyone deserves the best quality education.It is upsetting to see that on a day that is meant to be about compassion, the way it was presented showed utter contempt.Austerity is not about eating jacket potatoes once a term, it is about not being able to afford anything else.A menu on the school website, for a week in May, gave a flavour of what is usually on offer for lunch at the school.Pupils tucked into delights such as Malaysian snapper Curry with okra and tomato, warm chicken and asparagus Caesar Salad, and plum and blackcurrant sponge.According to the schools website, the fee per term for the academic year 2017-2018 is £7,978, and for new entrants to the senior school (Year 12) the fee per term is £8,577.The school fee includes lunch, the website said.Susanna Reid -

They’ve far too much to discuss among themselves.”Migration is plunging European politics into crisis again. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition is threatening to break apart over the issue.While in Italy, the new government is threatening to close its southern border — blocking migrant rescue ships from landing — and open its northern border, encouraging illegal migrants and asylum seekers to head north to Germany and Sweden.So worried is European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that he is hosting a mini-summit tomorrow to try to find a solution to the migrant crisis which can help save Merkel’s political career.It is tempting to look at the EU in crisis and say that is why the UK is leaving. But this crisis is making it more difficult for Britain to get a reasonable Brexit deal.The European Commission is running the Brexit negotiations.Its priority is in defending the theology of the European Union, rather than finding practical solutions. As one leading figure in the Government laments to me, Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier “won’t budge off CETA (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) with Northern Ireland stuck in the customs union”.This kind of Canada-style free trade deal is regarded by the Government as inadequate.Mrs May and co have long hoped that the member states, nearly all of whose economies would be hurt by such a limited agreement, would intervene at some point and tell the Commission to engage more constructively with the UK. But this is happening all too rarely.One of the reasons is, in the words of one member of the Brexit inner Cabinet: “Only four national capitals are fully across Brexit.”Many of the countries that are most sympathetic to the UK don’t have the capacity to follow all of the issues concerned.Over the past few years, the key to any deal in Europe has been Merkel. She is not now going to ride to Britain’s rescue— as David Cameron found to his cost in the renegotiation.But the German Chancellor could push the Commission towards a slightly more pragmatic approach.However, she is now trying to keep her own governing coalition together, as well as come up with a deal with the French for eurozone reform, leaving next to no time for Brexit.I am told that when Brexit is discussed in meetings she is “visibly distracted”, turning to aides for advice far more frequently than she does on other issues.This situation is one of the many reasons why the Government should have prepared vigorously for no deal: A credible threat to walk away from the table if the Commission didn’t behave in a reasonable fashion would have got the member states’ attention.But Mrs May now must hope the EU can patch together some deal on migration and that the member states begin thinking seriously about what kind of post-Brexit relationship they want with this country.WHEN the Cabinet gathers at Chequers next month to thrash out the UK’s offer to the EU, one of the most contentious issues will be customs.The Brexit inner Cabinet is split between those who favour a so-called “new customs partnership” (NCP) with the EU – which would see the UK continue to apply EU tariffs after Brexit, with companies receiving a rebate if their goods stayed in Britain rather than heading to the continent – and those who advocate Max Fac, which would use technology to minimise border checks.Two Cabinet working groups are trying to find a way to make these ideas work. Neither group has had a decisive breakthrough yet. But I am told the Max Fac one is “not a million miles away” from a solution.The challenge for the PM is to make these plans acceptable to her own side, including David Davis and Liam Fox. One Brexit inner Cabinet member tells me: “She’s got to have David and Liam. If she doesn’t have them, then she has no solution.”Both Davis and Fox support the Max Fac option. But there are influential figures in No10 who remain convinced that NCP is the option to go for. They argue only NCP can help deal with the Irish border issue and get the Government through next month’s crucial Commons votes on the customs union. They warn: “No NCP, no Brexit.”The fear among Brexiteers is Mrs May will use this Chequers meeting to try to push through a modified version of NCP. They fear the reason the whole Cabinet will be present on the second day is to give Mrs May the numbers to do this if the Brexit inner Cabinet remains split on the issue.Doing this, though, would be extremely risky. It would leave Mrs May with a policy that neither her Brexit Secretary nor her International Trade Secretary support.THE Chancellor and the Defence Secretary aren’t just split over how much money the military should get, but what it should be spent on, too.One Cabinet ally of Philip Hammond’s complains that Gavin Williamson wants to “spend the money on uniformed officers when he should be spending it on robotics and the like”.Their view is that this would be a better response to the 21st-century security challenges Britain faces.But in truth, Britain needs both conventional and new, hi-tech forces if it is to respond to the variety of threats now out of there. That is why we MUST spend more on defence.Those close to Williamson point out that if the Government doesn’t increase the defence budget, our status as the leading military spender in Europe – upon which so much of our influence in the world depends – will be under threat as the French and the Germans increase their military budgets.NEXT week, Theresa May will give a speech setting out the Government’s post-Brexit industrial strategy.Key to this must be artificial intelligence, an area where we are one of the leading nations in the world.I understand that the importance of maintaining the UK’s edge in AI is what led to Mrs May accepting Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Digital Secretary Matt Hancock’s argument that visa rules for tech entrepreneurs must be relaxed.The countries that succeed at AI will end up defining this century.So any deal with the EU must preserve the UK’s ability to regulate these industries of the future in a way decided by us, not Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is staggering that the ­Government is still undecided on ­fundamental principles.But the Tories’ woes were hugely exacerbated by their election calamity, caused in part by Remainers hoping Labour would betray Brexit.That emboldened diehards in the Lords and Commons — operating alongside the lavishly-funded, slickly orchestrated campaign colluding with Brussels to annul the biggest vote in our history.Meanwhile the national conversation has degenerated into a tsunami of hate, chiefly from sanctimonious Remainers branding Leavers uneducated racists.How much better off we would all now be if on June 24, 2016 they had grudgingly accepted defeat and pledged instead to make the best of Brexit.In fairness, some Remainers did. TV’s Richard Madeley spoke for them recently when he said we now had a duty to see it through in full by leaving the single market and customs union.He was right. To pretend that Brexit can be “softened” to honour the substantial Remain vote — a nightmarish fudge which Boris Johnson warns of today — is simply dishonest. There is leaving and there is remaining. That’s it.Brussels has revelled in Britain tearing itself apart. Now it is sidetracked by its own problems. A deal looks miles off.Theresa May has only one path forward. At next month’s pivotal vote, she must defeat the backbench rebellion hoping to shackle us to a customs union restricting our trading future. That is not Brexit, as voters would quickly realise. It would reignite the Leave ­campaign with unprecedented ferocity.And the PM and her Cabinet must not be derailed by Remain-fanatic businesses muttering about pulling out. Previous such threats have proved bogus, like all those dire economic forecasts.Leaving may not be smooth in the short-term. That must not deter us.When the EU finally realises Brexit in full is inevitable maybe they will stop playing games and agree a deal.But if the Remain resistance succeeds in crippling Brexit, it will bring on chaos.Our current divisions will seem like happy hour. And it will be their fault.HEARTBREAKING, isn’t it, to see Argentina in disarray and the Germans wobbling at the World Cup?

The whole event was a celebration of the female form and for all the contestants, the event was about empowering each other.I didn\u0027t feel I was being judged in a negative way. I found it very liberating being in a swimsuit and people had worked hard to be able to enter the competition.To be named the winner was incredible.

Amber Massie-Blomfield hit out at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in an open e-mail that she posted on Twitter. She was asked to be part of the Her Way campaign, which aims to showcase routes into employment and empower women to craft their own future in work. The campaign declares: Women are often caught up in conflicting messages about their work: they ‘can’t’ do certain jobs or reach certain job levels, but at the same time are told to aspire to ‘have it all’. But when she asked to be paid for this task, she was told: Unfortunately, we can’t pay contributors - but would see it taking only a few hours of your time.   In a pithy email reply, Amber wrote: You will no doubt appreciate the irony of the DWP asking me to work with you as a contributor in this way without being paid. As an employee of the DWP, how would you advise I pay my mortgage, make my pension contribution, or indeed, feed myself, during the time I spend working, free-of-charge, on your campaign?

We are in the grip of a crisis in our health. Approximately 14 million adults are obese. Around 15 million more are overweight. Based on current trends half of our children will be obese by 2020. The national cost to the NHS is upwards of \u0026pound5billion a year. The personal cost can be catastrophic, with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cancer, strokes and mental health conditions. Two years ago, Theresa May flunked the opportunity to make a big intervention with her first obesity plan, which failed to tackle junk food advertising and instead relied on voluntary action by the food and drinks industry.  It also ducked the issue of cheap, unhealthy supermarket offers. What’s more the Government is making \u0026pound800million cuts to public health budgets, which means councils are forced to cut support services to combat obesity. The whole approach has been a disaster. And next week we fear we will get the same again. This crisis won’t be solved by a silver bullet. It’s got to be a many-pronged approach. One of those prongs has to be advertising.  A recent study found that young people who saw a junk food ad every day were twice as likely to be obese as those that didn’t. We must find a way to deal with this. Recent reports have said the Government plans to ban junk food advertising on TV before 9pm but that won’t cut it. Our children don’t spend hours a day watching TV any more. They are on their phones, gaming or watching YouTube. Banning ads on TV and leaving the online world alone will just see junk food ads flooding to platforms which are much less regulated and much less responsible than broadcasters.  Frankly, that would be an analogue policy for a digital age. It’s not just on screens that kids are bombarded with advertising. It’s on the bus, on trains and on their walk to school. Junk food advertising is banned within 100m of schools in some places but a 100m blackout isn’t enough. The test for the Government’s strategy will be that it tackles junk food advertising across the board. It must also deal with the plague of buy-one, get-one free offers that are the bugbear of many parents. How often do you see children screaming for chocolate – egged on by in-your-face offers – at the supermarket till queue? Right now, you can’t go to a corner shop without being surrounded by World Cup branded sweets and crisps placed at a child’s eye level.  As the Mirror highlighted this week, the manufacturers say they are labelling their products more clearly but what child thinks of a small packet of sweets as con\u0026shy\u0026shytaining two or more servings? The time to ask the giant food conglomerates, the manufacturers and the retailers to put their houses in order has long passed. They have failed to show any responsibility for the health of the nation – the only responsibility they show is the one to supply their owners and shareholders with booming profits. The sugar tax – one of the only things the Labour Party will ever thank former Chancellor George Osborne for – shows intervention can force the industry to change. If the Government’s second chance strategy is to really make a difference it needs to think bigger – about extending that tax to confectionary and other snacks.

Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith is expected to back Trident, call for more money for the military and attack Theresa May for starving defence of cash when she addresses the Royal United Services Institute think tank on Monday. A source said: “In government the Tories have slashed defence spending, cut the size of the Army and are giving a raw deal to our servicemen and women. “Labour wants to see proper investment in defence and a decent pay rise for our men and women who have had to endure seven years of real terms pay cuts since 2010, despite rising rents in service accommodation and cuts to tax credits.”  The Prime Minister is under mounting pressure after she threw into doubt Britain’s status as a tier one military power. It is widely taken to mean a country which has a full spectrum of military capabilities, including nuclear weapons, special forces, a navy, army and air force capable of being deployed anywhere in the globe. She pointedly refuse to use the phrase when challenged this week, despite standing next to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in No 10. With the Army about 5,000 below its manpower target and repeated warnings about expensive equipment such as new stealth fighter jets and armoured vehicles widening the black hole in the defence budget, Labour believes the Tories are vulnerable over defence. This year’s Armed Forces Continuous Attitudes Survey, slipped out last month(MAY, revealed 35% of personnel are dissatisfied with Service life amid plunging morale.  Just 31% of troops are satisfied with their pay, a drop of 52% compared with when the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Ms Griffith’s speech to RUSI comes in the week of Armed Forces Day and ahead of next month’s(JULY) crunch NATO summit in Brussels where Donald Trump is expected to rap allies for failing to pump enough cash into their military. She was appointed to the tricky Shadow Defence Secretary post in October 2016 amid renewed scrutiny of Labour’s policies for the Armed Forces.

June 21, the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, is the longest day in the year - affording us approximately 17 hours of daylight. Technically, this also means that the nights will start drawing in again now - so there\u0027s really no time like the present to get out and explore the great outdoors on some of the country’s most breathtaking bike rides. We\u0027ve taken a look around the UK to find the best places to watch the sun setting.  1. Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, Fraserburgh, Scotland   A small village called Maud in Aberdeenshire offers a starting place for a traffic-free cycle to the coast. If you\u0027re in the mood to learn then head to the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses in Fraserburgh. The sun will set at around 10.12pm this week in this part of Scotland, so you\u0027ve got loads of time to enjoy the start of the summer.  Bike need replacing?       If your existing bike needs replacing, you\u0027ll want something efficient and speedy for the roads - like the Carrera Parva Hybrid bike , which comes in versions for both men and women and is now just \u0026pound210 (a saving of \u0026pound90).  And if you don\u0027t need a new bike, why not have yours checked over before setting off. Like any mode of transport your bike needs to be looked after and regularly checked for wear and tear.  Halfords offers a 32-point Free Bike Check which includes:   Frame, saddle and handlebar Wheels including tyres, rims, spokes and hubs Brake system including levers, calipers, pads and cables / hoses Drivetrain including gears, levers, chain, bottom bracket, cranks and cables   2. The Eden Project, Cornwall      Why not spend the day enjoying the amazing sights at the Eden Project? Best of all, if you arrive by bike you\u0027ll get a discount on entry. The sun sets on Eden at around 9:30pm on the solstice. Bear in mind though that the Eden Project shuts at 6pm, so you\u0027ll need to watch the sun go down somewhere nearby.   Get there in style on the Carrera Subway 1 Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound300. With easy to use 24 speed Shimano gearing, your effort for building speed will be minimised on all terrains, while its lightweight aluminium frame means you can quickly and efficiently ride to your destination.   Camping out?      Planning to camp? Be sure you book in advance as you won\u0027t want to be without a pitch.  Croft Farm Holiday Park is just a mile from the Eden Project and three miles from the beach. Pentewan Sands is also nearby and boasts amazing family facilities - as well as the nearby Pentewan Cycle Trail.   Consider taking a Halfords Vis A Vis 4 Person Tent with you, which is currently reduced to just \u0026pound60, (was \u0026pound150, save \u0026pound90). The simple tunnel design is easy to pitch in approximately 20 minutes. With two separate bedrooms and a living area, it\u0027s perfect for families or groups of friends.   For additional comfort pack an Urban Escape Folding Table And Bench Set , \u0026pound40 (was \u0026pound50, save \u0026pound10) which folds down into a single carry case to make it easy to transport and store.      3. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales   The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is an absolutely beautiful part of Wales and a stunning place to watch the sun go down. There are loads of campsites in the area, including some unique places to stay. There are plenty of bike routes too, with some offering traffic-free options if you want a more peaceful ride. In Pembrokeshire you can expect the sun to set around 9:39pm.  Why not try..       The Boardman ADV 8.8 Adventure Bike , \u0026pound750, is a bike truly made to help you explore new possibilities. This bike is adept at riding in comfort on roads but really excels when you want to get off the beaten track.         4. White Nancy, Cheshire      Located on Kerridge Hill, White Nancy is a local landmark from which you can see all around the area, from Wales to the west and the Pennines to the north. From time to time White Nancy is painted to look like other things, like a Christmas pudding or with Olympic rings when London hosted in 2012. The sun will set over White Nancy at around 9:36 this week.  Need to drive?     Heading further afield to enjoy the sunny days? If you\u0027re packing up the whole family into the car for a camping trip, make sure it\u0027s in good running order first.  A Free Car Check performed by Halfords experts will put your mind at rest. Book online or just pop in to your local Halfords store and trained colleagues will carry out a free car bulb check and check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips. They\u0027ll even give you a free screenwash top-up too.    If you\u0027re making an unfamiliar journey, don\u0027t forget to get the Garmin Drive Sat Nav , \u0026pound79.99 (was \u0026pound99.99, save \u0026pound20.99). With lifetime map updates you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road.   5. Edinburgh Castle, Scotland   There are few places that are as stunning as Edinburgh Castle, located atop Castle Rock. The views of Edinburgh from the castle are amazing, and a great place to watch the end of the day roll around. Sunset here will take place at 9:58pm.  6. Hampstead Heath, London   The scenery on Hampstead Heath always pleases the eye. This amazing part of London has views of every landmark you could hope for and it\u0027s a wonderful place to watch the sun go down. This will happen at around 9:18pm in the capital.        7. Osborne House, Isle of Wight      The home of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert is quite a sight to see. Accessible by bike (and ferry, if you\u0027re not an island resident), it\u0027s the ideal place to see during the day before you settle down somewhere to watch the sunset. If you\u0027re up for the cycle, Shanklin Chine on the west of the island is well worth an evening visit.   Do it with ease - and classic style - on the Pendleton Somerby Electric Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound750. With added electrically powered pedal assistance, it delivers 40 - 50 miles of range through a rear hub motor with speed sensor. This extra power is enough to guarantee effortless rides, taking the strain out of hills and making moving off from a standstill much easier.   If you prefer, this bike is also available in a non electric version and in a range of colours - we love the mint green !  The sunset starts at 9:18pm near Osborne House and 9:17pm in Shanklin Chine.     8. Ness Point, Lowestoft          Ness Point is the UK\u0027s most easterly point. This makes it a great place to ride to on National Cycle Route 1. Make yourself comfortable on the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , \u0026pound10 (half price) and watch the waves crash in as the sun goes down.  Sunset is 9:16 at the UK\u0027s most easterly point.     9. Blackpool Pleasure Beach, Lancashire      With plenty of places to cycle in the area you could have an amazing day out in Blackpool. Start with a ride to the Pleasure Beach, and have some fun with the kids (or without them!) on the roller coasters. When all that\u0027s done you can have fish and chips while the sun sets on another day. The sun will go set at around 9:43 in Blackpool.     10. Cotswolds, England   Spread over six counties there\u0027s a lot to see in the Cotswolds. Consider taking a ride through the picturesque Castle Combe to take in the amazing houses and the stunning market square. The sun sets on this beautiful village at 9:26pm     Find your way by car - and beat the traffic       If you\u0027re driving to somewhere new then why not add a sat nav to your car? The TomTom GO 6200 , \u0026pound270, (was \u0026pound339.99, save \u0026pound69.99) adds real-time traffic information to the navigational benefits of a sat nav (smartphone required for this feature).         11.

He controlled a number of aspects of his girlfriend’s life including the clothes and make-up she wore, what she ate, when she could shower, and who she was allowed to speak to while he also prevented her from speaking in her mother tongue and from contacting friends and family. He also hated her laughing and made her be quiet when she was in his presence.  A sentencing hearing at Newport Crown Court on Friday heard Hussain first attacked his victim after he saw her smoking a cigarette and she declined to hold his hand in public. It was at this stage he used the belt and hanger to whip his girlfriend, including her chest and private areas. On another occasion, after she looked at a LinkedIn account of a former boyfriend, Hussain threw her about, punched and kicked her, and strangled her before trashing her room. He told his terrified victim – who feared for her life and was so scared she wet herself – he would not hit her in the head because the head is for slapping. After another argument was started by the defendant, he punched and kicked his girlfriend and forced her to strip naked.  Straight after the assault Hussain went to the gym but complained his bench pressing had been affected by hand injuries sustained during the beating. She was later forced to massage his hands to soothe his injuries. Hussain, of Birmingham, was later convicted of coercive and controlling behaviour and assault occasioning ABH and he pleaded guilty to a count of assault occasioning ABH. In a statement read out to the court by prosecutor Sarah Waters, his victim said she felt destroyed as a person as a result of the relationship in which she felt trapped. She described the defendant as being extreme in everything he did and of pushing her beyond her boundaries. She said: I think it’s difficult for anyone who has not been in a controlling relationship to understand why I stayed with him but retrospectively I hate myself for being a coward and not running away. What should have been one of the best years of my life studying abroad turned into a nightmare.

Charles Howeson, 68, used his qualities, advantages and power to act as a sexual predator towards young men while in three separate roles between 1985 and 1994. He was convicted of 10 indecent assaults against eight young men during that period, following a trial at Bristol Crown Court last year. The court heard he was the effective captain of HMS Cleopatra in 1985 and groped a junior member of crew on an unlit deck. A Royal Navy inquiry was launched after the victim, and a second man who reported Howeson for touching his stomach and tugging at his shirt, complained. Judge Mark Horton said senior officers associated with Howeson effectively closed ranks and put his interests, and the reputation of the Navy, above those whom it should have been protecting. Howeson was given a formal warning by the Royal Navy and never commanded a ship of the fleet again - though was promoted - and retired in 1990.  He then worked as a chief executive at a charity in Plymouth, where he indecently assaulted six volunteers in dark tunnels on Drake\u0027s Island and dark rooms. Complaints were made but the allegations were not reported to police to save the reputation of the trust, the judge said, and Howeson was allowed to resign. Following his resignation, Howeson saw a further opportunity to manipulate and assault another young man. The judge ordered Howeson, of Craigie Drive, Plymouth, to pay prosecution costs of \u0026pound50,000 and sign the sex offenders register indefinitely. This case has revealed that to the outside world you displayed the finest qualities of diplomacy, charisma, endeavour, organisation and charm which you demonstrated during your period in the Navy and in your extensive and successful career and involvement at the very highest level with public bodies, authorities, businesses including a bank but also in your public and charitable works mainly associated with the community of Plymouth, the judge told Howeson. The hidden and dark truth is these same qualities were the very qualities which enabled you to mask and conceal a dark secret only revealed for the world to see some 30 years later in this trial. That secret was your uncontrolled and predatory sexual behaviour particularly towards young or at least vulnerable men under your control. Between 1985 and 1994, in three separate roles in your professional life, you used all of your qualities, advantages and power to use and abuse your position to enable you to act as a sexual predator. In most cases you effectively trapped them like prey in order to abuse them.

War hero Bill Speakman was just 24 when he fought off a sustained attack from 6,000 Chinese and North Korean solders for more than four hours in 1951, despite receiving a shrapnel wound in his leg. The 6ft 6in soldier, known as ‘Big Bill’, pelted enemy soldiers with grenades until they ran out. He then hurled rocks, tins and even empty beer bottles at them. He was given a hero’s welcome by thousands of people on the streets of his hometown of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, when he returned a year later. Speakman became the first man to receive a Victoria Cross from Queen Elizabeth II for outstanding bravery, and was one of only a handful of living holders of the award.  Despite his great height and courage, he was known as a modest and quiet man who struggled to adjust to civilian life and the celebrity which followed his great investiture. Born on September 21, 1927, Bill was raised by a single mum and started his military career when he was 17, serving in Germany, Italy and Hong Kong with the Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland. He transferred to the King’s Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB) as a private when British troops mobilised for Korean service in 1950.  His regiment was bombarded with shell and mortar fire in the early hours of November 4, 1951 as they defended a position on Maryang San in Korea, but Speakman fought back with grenades and beer bottles sent to the line for consumption by the platoon, breaking up several enemy attacks. His charge against the enemy allowed his overrun troops enough time to evacuate their wounded. Talking of the life-or-death seige, he said: “It was hand-to-hand. There was no time to pull back the bolt of the rifle. “It was November, the ground was hard, so grenades bounced and did damage.”  Recalling the moment he was handed the award, he said: “When I got it The King [George VI] was alive but he was very ill. “He awarded me the VC and then he died. So The Queen – I was her first VC. It was a wonderful moment. I think she was nervous and I was very nervous.” The announcement of the Victoria Cross award said: “Private Speakman’s heroism under intense fire throughout the operation and when painfully wounded was beyond praise and is deserving of supreme recognition.” "},{"url":null,"title":"little oscar 300 seizures day","story":"News\u0027Little Oscar has 300 seizures a day and we can\u0027t carry on like this - we need cannabis oil legalised now\u0027Five people blighted by health problems every day explain how \u0027illegal\u0027 substance helps them through life - and why they need a law change\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLaura Connor22:24, 22 JUN 2018Updated02:11, 23 JUN 2018NewsEmma Smith, 34, at her home in Bradford with her son Oscar, 5 (Image: SWNS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe debate on legalising cannabis for medical use has been reignited. Home Secretary Sajid Javid, inset, has announced a review of the drug. And he stepped in to allow Billy Caldwell, 12, to have cannabis oil to treat severe epilepsy. Thousands of patients who rely on the drug have to buy it on the black market. Here, five people – including five-year-old Oscar Smith’s mum Emma – explain why they want a law change. Mum wants to help Oscar - but won\u0027t do it illegally  Oscar has hundreds of epileptic seizures a day and his mum Emma is desperate for him to be able to try cannabis but is unwilling to buy it illegally. The youngster, from Bradford, West Yorks, has myoclonic astatic epilepsy, a form of childhood epilepsy. Also known as Doose syndrome, it affects two out of 100 children with epilepsy. Emma, also mum to Alex, four, says: “Oscar has tried a range of medication to try to stop the seizures but nothing works. “We believe he should be given the opportunity to try cannabis oil because it has been proven to work in cases like his, such as Billy’s. We think it could change his life. “The next step for Oscar is surgery but doctors have said it won’t stop his seizures, it will only reduce their frequency. I believe it should be given to him on prescription, by a doctor. And he needs it now. We can’t carry on like this. “My husband Jason and I have considered taking Oscar abroad to access cannabis but why should we have to do that? “It should be available in his own country, on the NHS.” Dad-of-2 with Parkinson\u0027s says it\u0027s only thing that helps  Dad-of-two Ian was diagnosed with early onset Parkinson’s disease two years ago and says that cannabis is the only thing that helps relive his severe tremors. Ian, from Cromer, in Norfolk, says he has even seen his condition improve since taking it. He endured deep brain stimulation to help mask his symptoms but the medication prescribed for his disease makes him feel extremely unwell. So he self-medicates with cannabis using a vaporiser once a day, which calms his tremors after about 20 minutes – almost stopping them. “The sense of relief is overwhelming,” the former IT consultant says.  “Not only does it reduce my tremors, it lessens the muscle spasms and contractions – known as dystonia – in my foot, which I otherwise wouldn’t be able to control. “It also makes my voice stronger, which makes it easier for me to get words out, plus it helps me sleep. “I have to get my cannabis on the black market which, from a medical perspective, makes no sense. If it was controlled, I would know exactly how much to take. “Self-medicating does worry me, so it would take a huge moral and financial weight off my shoulders if I could access cannabis from my GP.” Medical professionals urge Jacob to smoke to help with the pain  Jacob has suffered from chronic pain for years and now grows his own cannabis plants at home, on the advice of medical professionals. Jacob, from Hackney in East London, was born with a diaphragmatic hernia – an abnormal opening in his diaphragm. He has been taking cannabis, which he vaporises to smoke in an e-cigarette daily, for 10 years. The music producer has been unable to work due to his debilitating condition. He was prescribed the heroin substitute methadone, an opiate, for years but it was making him ill. “In 2007, I had invasive surgery which left me with intense pain, spasms, digestion and dietary problems,” he says. “I lost three stone when I was in hospital on opiates – it kills your appetite and makes you sick. Cannabis is the total opposite. It makes me hungry, improves my mood and helps me sleep. “It makes no sense that it’s legal to get stoned on opiates but not on cannabis. “To expect anyone to cope or even survive on opiate-based medications is cruel and inhumane. We need to remove the stigma from medical cannabis use. I can’t imagine me still being here if I carried on taking opiates.” Stroke victim was bedbound - but cannabis helps her walk  Stroke victim Carly was bedbound for five years before taking cannabis. She was walking again within weeks and now buys the drug on the black market. “I got desperate and tried a few puffs of cannabis one day and I couldn’t believe it,” she says. The artist, from Warrington, Cheshire, suffered a stroke in 2010, in her third year at university in Brighton. She was later diagnosed with auto-immune disease fibromyalgia, which causes pain all over the body, increased physical sensitivity, fatigue and muscle stiffness. She tried prescriptions of morphine and fentanyl but the opiates left her unable to talk properly or think clearly. She says of cannabis: “It did exactly the opposite of what the opiates did. I could sleep, I could think clearly, I could hold a conversation. “Within four weeks of using cannabis, I was walking without my stick. It’s what gets me out of bed out of the morning.” Carly says her cannabis use is saving the NHS \u0026pound500 a month – the cost of her opiate prescription. But she says buying the drug on the black market makes her feel “like a criminal” and has put her in potentially dangerous situations.

They found the number of people underestimating their size has grown alongside the body-positivity movement. Analysis showed 58% of overweight men thought in 2015 they were slimmer than they really were, up from 48% in 1997. The same applied to 31% of women, compared with 25% in 2015.  People underestimating their size were 85% less likely to try to slim down. Prof Dr Raya Muttarak, University of East Anglia, said: “Seeing the potential of the fuller-sized market, retailers may have contributed to normalisation of being overweight and obese. “While [the] body-positive movement helps reduce stigmatisation, it can potentially undermine the recognition of being overweight and its health consequences.

Former pupils of St Paul\u0027s Girls\u0027 School in Hammersmith, west London, said it showed utter contempt for describing jacket potatoes with beans and coleslaw as an austerity meal today. The exercise, which saw money go to charities, has also led to widespread criticism on social media. The prestigious school usually serves its 700 students the likes of seared cod, slow-cooked Moroccan lamb and duck leg confit for lunch. But it altered its lavish menu for the day and donated the money saved to charity.  In a tweet which appears to have been deleted, the school said: Today was the final Austerity Day of the year. Students and staff had baked potatoes, with beans and coleslaw, for lunch, with fruit for dessert. The money saved will be donated to the school\u0027s charities.   But Henna Shah, 24, a former St Paul\u0027s student, said: I am incredibly grateful to have gone to a school that has given me opportunities someone like me would never have had otherwise. Yet I recognise that few people like me get the chance to have an education like this on a bursary scheme like I did. I am highlighting this now because this is not about pulling the ladder up behind me — I joined the Labour party and work in politics now precisely because everyone deserves the best quality education.         Henna, of Hounslow, west London, added: It is upsetting to see that on a day that is meant to be about compassion, the way it was presented showed utter contempt. Austerity is not about eating jacket potatoes once a term, it is about not being able to afford anything else. And a Twitter account called @everydayhunger wrote: Can they really be unaware that for families living in poverty today, this \u0027austerity\u0027 meal is completely out of reach? Maybe they should visit their local food bank to see what genuine poverty rations look like. Twitter user Georgia O\u0027Brien wrote: One of the country\u0027s leading independent schools holding an \u0027Austerity Day\u0027 where students eat what is basically amounts to a standard state school dinner. Pupils at the school usually tuck into delights such as Malaysian snapper Curry with okra and tomato and warm chicken and asparagus Caesar Salad.  According to the school\u0027s website, the fee per term for the academic year 2017-2018 is \u0026pound7,978, and for new entrants to the senior school (Year 12) the fee per term is \u0026pound8,577. The school fee includes lunch, the website said. A food section on the website says: Everyone knows teenage girls can be picky eaters, so we try to give them lots of choice.

Dan, 40, was at work 200 miles away in Hull when he heard Nicola\u0027s screams down the phone as she pleaded for her life before she was stabbed 10 times. Porczynski later pleaded guilty at St Albans Crown Court to Nikki\u0027s manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was ordered to be detained in a secure psychiatric unit for an indefinite period.

We had the conversation so every day from the day Nikki died decision making was always based around what would Nikki do, what would Nikki want and we still do that today.  Nikki wanted me to be happy. She wanted the children to be happy. She was that type of person and that gives me confidence knowing I\u0027m doing the right thing. I honestly believed for a long time that I would never meet anybody else and then gradually things changed and I began to realise that I didn\u0027t want to be on my own for the rest of my life and I knew what Nikki wanted for me.

Brave Dan, who following Nicola\u0027s death set up the charity Nikki\u0027s Wishes to help children who have suffered from bereavement in his late wife\u0027s memory, says they will never forget her. Dan added: There will always be that sadness that Nikki is not around. We\u0027ll always miss her. We\u0027ll always love her. We\u0027ll always remember her. We have to keep moving forward as well as holding onto that nice bit of the past. We do, obviously, have our daily issues that we need to address around the event of what happened to Nikki and that will continue, but in general we are a positive family and we\u0027ll keep being so.     Dan first revealed he had found love again back in January when he appeared on This Morning. He said: A year ago this weekend I met Alex, she\u0027s fitted beautifully into our lives. It\u0027s a brave decision to get involved with a family like this, she\u0027s a mental health clinician and she can do things with the kids. She does memory boxes where you use your hands and other techniques to bring back memories. It\u0027s been amazing, quite freaky really to have someone come in who\u0027s so perfect.      Speaking to Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, Dan explained how counselling has helped him and his children to deal with the trauma.  He said: Stanley was six and Isabella was three at the time, I was telling her to leave and go to my mum and dad\u0027s but before she could leave he broke through the back doors and killed her. I didn\u0027t know what happened to the children until I heard them crying on the phone, and knew they were okay. Dan and his children moved in with his parents after the horrific night, but he returns to his former home sometimes so he can let out his emotions in private and feel closer to Nikki.  Dan underwent trauma counselling afterwards and said he experienced flashbacks within the first month after Nicola died. I felt like I couldn\u0027t breathe, I was back in that moment and then I realised if I\u0027m going to be a good dad to the kids and make sure they\u0027re confident, happy adults then I need to get help, he said.

Nigel Ingram, 57, and John Blight, 58, were found guilty of failing to disclose more than 100 items of unreported wreck from the HMS Hermes in the English Channel - including a torpedo hatch, launch panels and chinaware. The two men were found at the location of the HMS Hermes by French maritime officers on Tuesday September 30 2014. Ingram was still in the water at the time, having dived from Blight’s boat called De Bounty. Although no offences were identified at the time officers were suspicious of the lifting equipment on the boat, resulting in an underwater exploration of the Hermes three days later.  HMS Hermes was a protected cruiser built in the late 19th century and converted into an aircraft ferry and depot ship ready for the start of the First World War. It was sunk by a German submarine in the Dover Strait in October 1914, causing the loss of 44 British lives. After the exploration a criminal investigation was launched by the French authorities and later referred to Kent Police, resulting in the arrests of Ingram and Blight on Monday October 19, 2015. More than 100 items of unreported wreck were recovered at Ingram’s home along with approximately \u0026pound16,000 cash.  A number of photographs were also located on his computer, one of which showed the condenser of the Hermes on the back of De Bounty approximately four hours after it had been boarded by the French surveillance officers. Police established through subsequent enquiries that Ingram had cashed a cheque from a scrap merchant for \u0026pound5,029 the day after, on Wednesday, October 1 2014. Also seized from Ingram’s home was a notebook entitled ‘De Bounty, Diver Recovery’ that contained details of what dives were undertaken and the items recovered, including the condenser. The total value of the wreck collected was estimated at being more than \u0026pound150,000.  None of the items listed were reported to the Receiver of Wreck as they should have been. Ian Hope, prosecuting, said the pair hauled huge pieces of wrecks from the seabed using winching equipment on Mr Blight\u0027s boat. They deliberately and dishonestly failed to declare them to the authorities, as they were legally obligated to do, On Friday June 22 2018 both men were found guilty of fraud relating to their failure to disclose recovered items in order to make a financial gain, following a two-week trial at Canterbury Crown Court. Ingram, from Teynham, Kent was subsequently jailed for four years and Blight from Winchelsea, East Sussex for three-and-a-half years. Investigating officer PC Anne Aylett, of Kent Police, said: The HMS Hermes and other shipwrecks of its kind are legally protected for a reason, and that is because they form an important part of the history of this country.  Nigel Ingram and John Blight have demonstrated a complete disregard for the law by helping themselves to artefacts that should have remained beneath the sea instead of being brought to the surface and sold for scrap metal. We are proud of our close working relationship with our partner agencies, which in this case included the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the Marine Management Organisation, the Receiver of Wreck, Sussex Police, Historic England, Crown Prosecution Service and the French authorities, and take a robust approach to ensuring important historical items do not end up in the hands of people who are not entitled to them. We will continue to investigate anyone suspected of stealing items from sunken wrecks and seek to prosecute them when appropriate. Mark Harrison, head of heritage crime and policing advice for Historic England, said: All archaeological sites underwater comprise a finite, irreplaceable and fragile resource, vulnerable to damage and destruction through human activity.

A court heard today he was sprayed with CS gas and arrested after he reached for the blade and scuffled with two officers. The two officers had to be rushed to hospital.  Counter-terrorist police recovered evidence of extremist internet searches and WhatsApp messages saying he supported Isis from his handset. The taxi driver told the Old Bailey: I felt lonely and depressed. I told my sister I didn\u0027t want to live anymore. My intention was only to show the sword to a soldier or the police and so get them to shoot me. If I was going to do any acts of terrorism, I could have got out the car with my sword when Mr Gavin was approaching. I had so many chances. I reject the allegations of terrorism.  Chowdhury, from Luton, Beds., said he had felt guilty being a citizen of the United Kingdom while Muslims in Yemen were being killed by weapons that the government sold to Saudi Arabia. He continued: I came across articles criticising the UK government for selling weapons to Saudi Arabia who were killing these people. Since I realised we were giving aid to them and at the same time providing the weapons for them to be killed, I thought this was a massive contradiction. I felt depressed and guilty. I felt I was also responsible for the decisions taken by my government while my family were dying.  I had to shun these people, and show my disapproval. At the time I did not know not to do it. There was nothing I could do. I just wanted to disassociate myself from my governments decision. But Timothy Cray, prosecuting, claimed Chowdhury had always intended to scare people in Westminster, less than six months after a horrific terrorist attack there killed five innocent citizens . Mr Cray said: Your intention at the very least was to make sure you would do as much as you could possibly do to get lethal force with the firing of a weapon in a public place, right in the centre of London. Think about it now, there were people there. Anybody seeing the discharging of lethal force on the street would be scared.

The average discount on a new model is now 8.3% but can be as much as 25% offered on new Citroen models and back to zero for more luxury brands such as Porsche. But almost all buyers can find a saving as sales in the UK dip by around 6.8% so far this year, said the analysis by What Car? In a secret shopper test across 7,500 different cars it found all but 218 models offered some savings at franchised dealerships since the new 18-plate came in the showrooms in March. Discounts on diesels are the biggest among the various sectors, averaging 8.8% as the market dries up, and the lowest discounts are on electric and plug-in hybrids, just 2.1%.  Of all the cars, the manufacturer offering the biggest discounts across the range is DS - the upmarket offshoot of Citroen - said the What Car? survey. But among individual makes and models, the biggest cuts were just over 25% for a Seat Toledo and Fiat Punto and over 22% for a Volvo S60, BMW 7 Series, VW Passat and Mercedes SL. At the opposite end of the table, expensive Porsche (0%) and cheap Dacia (0.96%) offer little manoeuvre when it comes to getting money off the list price, said What Car? editor Steve Huntingford. It\u0027s an interesting marketplace for anyone looking to buy a new car at the moment, he said. As demand for diesels continues to wane, deals on electric cars have actually started to shrink since March.

I’ve been in that position and I understand how people are feeling in that bad place. “People say, ‘they don’t think about this, or they don’t think about that’, and you don’t because you’re in a completely different space. “You know people love you, but in those moments you forget.  “I think that if I had gone onto that railway bridge and seen messages like these then I would have realised there was hope, that someone did care, and that a person had taken the time to write this message for me. “It would have really helped.” Lisa, with the help of her husband Nick, 47, and 18-year-old daughter Molly, has decorated another bridge in Tameside, and one in neighbouring Stockport.

Jonathan Friedland, who worked as the streaming giant\u0027s head of communications, was dismissed on Friday. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings confirmed his departure to staff in a company-wide memo. Hastings said Friedland\u0027s use of the slur showed a deep lack of understanding and apologised to staff for not acting sooner over the incident, believed to have taken place several months ago. Freidland, a former journalist, worked as the company\u0027s Chief Communications Officer for over six years before his sacking.  I’m leaving Netflix after seven years. Leaders have to be beyond reproach in the example we set and unfortunately I fell short of that standard when I was insensitive in speaking to my team about words that offend in comedy, he said in a tweet on Friday. I feel awful about the distress this lapse caused to people at a company I love and where I want everyone to feel included and appreciated. I feel honored to have built a brilliant and diverse global team and to have been part of our collective adventure. Friedland was reported to have first used the word at a meeting with public relations staff about insensitive words in comedy. “Several people afterwards told him how inappropriate and hurtful his use of the N-word was, and Jonathan apologised to those that had been in the meeting,” Mr Hastings wrote.    “We hoped this was an awful anomaly never to be repeated.” However, just days later the executive used the racial term again during a meeting with black members of staff, who reported the incident to management. In his email, Hastings said Friedland had contributed greatly in many areas but had shown an unacceptably low racial awareness and sensitivity.  Jonathan has been a great contributor and he built a diverse global team creating awareness for Netflix, strengthening our reputation around the world, and helping make us into the successful company we are today. Many of us have worked closely with Jonathan for a long time, and have mixed emotions. Unfortunately, his lack of judgment in this area was too big for him to remain. We care deeply about our employees feeling safe and supported at Netflix.  During Mr Friedland\u0027s time at Netflix it has risen to one of the web\u0027s biggest players, reportedly valued at more than 140 billion dollars (\u0026pound106 billion).

She was last seen holding the man\u0027s hand disappearing into darkness at around 11.30pm. The man is later seen returning alone three hours later at around 2.30am. Police began a desperate hunt for the little girl after her parents realised she was missing and her body was found on a hillock 500 metre from the venue in the early hours of Thursday morning.  She had been raped then strangled. Police said a stone had been used to disfigure her face \u0027beyond recognition\u0027. A man, believed to be a member of the wedding catering team, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Dharmraj Meena, the Senior Superintendent of Police of Gwalior, said: “Our team reached the spot along with the forensic experts, after seeing the crime scene it is quite clear that the child had undergone a brutal sexual assault. The criminal had used a big stone to smash her face and kill her.  We have started an investigation and the culprit will be nabbed soon, right now we have zeroed in on one person who is a part of the catering team, we are questioning him for further leads.”  The victim had been sleeping with her family at the wedding venue and had got up to get water when she vanished, according to The Free Press Journal. She went to a water point there to quench her thirst. When she did not return, her family launched a search, but failed to find her,\u0027an official said. Police said she had been lured away with the promise of ice cream. A post mortem confirmed that she had been sexually assaulted. The case is the latest in a string of horrific rapes and murders which have rocked India over the last few years. In 2012, Jyoti Singh, a young woman who dreamed of being a physiotherapist, was assaulted on a bus.  Her injuries were so severe she later died, sparking mass protests, outrage and a call for change in a society where women face huge discrimination and live in fear of sexual assault. Despite the outcry, there has been little change since Jyoti\u0027s death at the age of 23.

The 32-year-old leapt into action when two youngsters, a boy aged seven, and girl aged six, got into difficulty while playing on a lilo in the swimming pool.  The dad-of-two, from Merseyside, told the Liverpool ECHO: I was putting some sun cream on, when I saw a little boy and girl struggling in the water.   She was trying to help him and she was going under. Their heads were bobbing up and down, I was looking at the lifeguard who saw it all, but did nothing. I hurdled over the front row of chairs, and dived in. It was 2.4 metres deep and the children were at the bottom. I carried them up to the surface, I don\u0027t know how I did it, looking back. I grabbed them both under my right arm, and put them on the side.  I went straight to the lifeguard to see what the hell he was doing. Mr Tartt made an official complaint to TUI about the incident, but says he heard nothing back. But a bottle of sparkling wine was sent up to his hotel room in the days following the near-drowning, as a thank you. It has since emerged the lifeguard on duty has been dismissed.

Natalie Fink and first boyfriend Yannick Gwarys, both 22, decided to start dating other people in 2016 - before meeting Michael Flamm, 22. The throuple share a bed most nights and say they are inspired by German artist Max Ernst, who lived in a polyamorous relationship. The men say they are heterosexual and never struggle with feelings of jealousy. Natalie said: “I’ve always known that I had to love and to live in my own way and not how society taught me to.  It was not as if I needed another partner but we were excited about sharing our life with a third party. I grew up in a big family and wanted to keep the feeling of community.” The next step of their relationship is to marry - and have children. “We want children - and it is important to me that both men will be accepted as fathers, independent of biological paternity,” said Natalie. Although we would want to know the biological father because of medical questions.  If it will be helpful for our life, two of us will definitely get married legally. The three of us will decide which couple would be the most economical. Above all, marriage is a spiritual promise. I do not need a lawyer for that. If we want to make a life commitment, nobody can stop us from doing it. Who knows, maybe we will invite our families to their first polyamorous wedding in their lifetime. Natalie and Yannick met at college and were friends for many years before they fell in love in 2014. They had another polyamorous relationship but the first run didn\u0027t really work out - because the \u0027candidate\u0027 recognised himself as monogamous in the end.

The well-preserved mummy, said to be that of an ancient woman, was still dressed in the silk skirt in her grave. She reportedly also had a pouch of pine nuts on her chest ready to take to the afterlife. A significant fall in the water level of a reservoir upstream of the giant 794ft tall Sayano-Shushenskaya hydroelectricity dam on the River Yenisei in south Russia led to the burial site of the woman - as old as Christ - reappearing on the shoreline.  “In her birch bark make-up box, she had a Chinese mirror,” reported The Siberian Times. “During excavations the mummy of a young woman was found on the shore of the reservoir. “The lower part of the body was especially well preserved, said archeologist Marina Kilunovskaya, from St Petersburg’s Institute of History of Material Culture. She continued: his is not a classic mummy - in this case, the burial was tightly closed with a stone lid, enabling a process of natural mummification.  Remarkably, the mummification partially survived her burial plot being drowned during the Soviet era in the early 1980s. Natalya Solovieva, the Institute of History of Material Culture\u0027s deputy director, said: On the mummy are what we believe to be silk clothes, a beaded belt with a jet buckle, apparently with a pattern… “Near the head was found a round wooden box covered with birch-bark in which lay a Chinese mirror in a felt case.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2cc1ff04e38-902x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc bright future lies ahead as new stadium looms for dark blues","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new multi-million pound state-of-the-art stadium and a team we’re promised will continue to play a brave and bold brand of passing football.As Dundee FC celebrates its 125th birthday, the future, under American owners, looks bright and exciting.The problem, as any long-suffering Dundee fan will tell you, is the history of the Dark Blues has been littered with promises that, if not always plain false, have not come to fruition.That means, for many, the attitude regarding the plans listed in the first line is very much one of seeing will be believing.And, while it’s not their fault, it’s a fact the current US-based owners just have to live with.A league game against Celtic in America apart, they have pretty much delivered what they said they would.The team has returned to the Premiership and stayed there for the past four seasons, not always as comfortably as they would like, but they have and that’s the most important thing.They’ve also brought a level of financial stability that would be the envy of many of the previous Dens Park regimes of the past 30 years or so.Yes, the club has been running at loss under them and any business expert would say theirs is not the ideal financial model for a football club.But so long as millionaire owner Tim Keyes is prepared to back the Dark Blues with his dollars, it is one that can work.For all that, any look at what the future will hold for Dundee Football Club has to include the use of words like uncertain and if. It was, of course, ever thus when predicting what may be in store for a football club.On the pitch, however good the squad may look, successful results can never be taken for granted.The season just ended is an example of that. While it would not be realistic to expect Dundee to finish in the top four, there was reason to believe the players should have been good enough to have mounted a serious challenge to make the Premiership’s top six.That they didn’t was disappointing but, despite some complaint about that, the reality of a club the size of Dundee is that any campaign that ends with them still in the top division has to be acceptable.The hope has to be that, with the right additions, next term will see that top-six challenge materialise.If it does, it can become a regular occurrence.As for the new stadium, it goes back to that phrase – seeing will be believing.The plans are impressive and the feeling the best bet for the future is to move away from Dens, home for the last 119 years but now ageing and in many ways impractical, is a sensible one.But the aim was the first spade would be in the ground at what’s been dubbed “Nou Campy” just north of the Kingsway and adjacent to Camperdown Park at some point this summer.Yes, there’s another couple of months to go before that becomes a false promise but, with no final planning permission in place as yet, time is running out.Of course, even if that’s what comes to pass, it doesn’t mean the stadium won’t be built.As we’ve seen up the coast at Aberdeen, such projects can be delayed, delayed and delayed again.If Nou Campy never gets off the ground, it doesn’t have to follow the club will be plunged into the latest of what down the years have been many crises.For many fans, wherever the team is playing, so long as it continues to be backed by the Keyes cash and is riding high in the Premiership, that bright future will have arrived.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29b42d531-435x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc four of the very best to have pulled on dark blue","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor what is a mid-sized club by Scottish standards, over their history it’s fair to say Dundee have punched well above their weight when it comes to producing and attracting top talent.In today\u0026#8217s look down memory lane, as we celebrate their 125th birthday, we highlight the very best of what has been a quality crop.Billy Steel: However long there is a Dundee FC, no list of the club’s greatest performers will ever be complete without the name Billy Steel.When director/manager George Anderson snapped the Scottish international inside-forward up from Derby County for a record £22,500 in September 1950, it went down as one of the transfer coups of the decade.Regarded as world class but known for being difficult to manage, Steel repaid the faith Anderson had shown in him and, in the next four years, would inspire Dundee to two League Cups.Steel left Dens in 1954 when he quit the senior game aged just 31. He moved to America where he died in 1982 but, 36 years later, remains regarded as one of Scotland’s greatest players.Claudio Caniggia: It was a case of 1950 and Billy Steel all over again when, in October 2000, Dundee sent tremors through the football world by announcing the signing of Argentine World Cup star Claudio Caniggia.In desperate need of a replacement for injured striker Fabian Caballero, the Dee’s Italian manager Ivano Bonetti used his Serie A connections and fixed up Caniggia, a former Roma team-mate of his brother and assistant Dario.In the end, the man who was Diego Maradona’s favourite strike partner for Argentina did not stay long at Dens Park, making just 21 league appearances and scoring seven goals, before heading for Rangers at the end of the 2000/01 campaign.Both for his performances and the gentlemanly way he conducted himself off the park, the impact he had on Dundee was considerably greater than the time he spent at Dens Park.Alan Gilzean: If there’s a debate over who the best-ever Dundee player is, when to comes to putting the ball in the net there can be no argument.Although down the years the club can boast some prolific scorers, there never has been, and is never likely to be, anyone who could match the ability of the legendary Alan Gilzean.Over 40 years after his playing career with the Dark Blues and then Spurs came to an end, those who saw him or played with or against him still regard him as being a world class centre-forward.Born in Coupar Angus, Dundee were his first senior club. He score an unequalled total of 169 goals for them and won the league in 1961/62 before being transferred to Spurs, where he enjoys similar legendary status, in 1964.Doug Cowie: The sands of time mean in some ways he is the forgotten man of Dundee greats but never to those who saw or played alongside Doug Cowie.Signed by George Anderson in 1945, over the next 16 years the Aberdonian would make a record 446 appearances, win two League Cups and also appear in two World Cups for Scotland.Cowie left Dens at the end of the season before the club won the championship but many of those who played in the side that clinched the title have often referred to the influence he had over their development on the pitch.As well as nurture it, Cowie would go on to show himself as an adept talent spotter. Once his playing days were over he worked for Dundee United and, along with fellow-scout Davie Small, was credited by Jim McLean as being instrumental in unearthing many of the local players who went on to bring the league flag to Tannadice in 1983.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.741936.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc humble claudio caniggia was even better off pitch barry smith","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee legend in his own right, Barry Smith captained the club for nine years before returning as manager in 2010.During that time he saw some of the best and some of the worst times in the history of the club.Among the best, however, was playing alongside some top-quality team-mates.And one name that stands out is Claudio Caniggia.Barry said: “I grew up watching guys like him play in World Cups, so I feel really fortunate to have played with Caniggia.“What made him stand out is, no matter how much he had done in the game before, he was so humble and had great humility.“What stood out for me is how he took time to help out the younger lads in training.

However, the one time they met them in a final they ran out 1-0 winners in December 1973.Jocky said: “The team that won the League Cup was a very good side.“Unfortunately, we couldn’t do more in the Scottish Cup because we kept meeting Celtic in the semi-final – we just couldn’t beat them.“When Rangers and Celtic are dominant, it’s very difficult. You’ve got to catch them on a bad day or get them in a final where you are on a hiding to nothing and just go out and play.“A semi-final is the worst game of all.“You’re within touching distance of the final but you’re not there yet.“Some players don’t handle that too well but then can handle a final.“Around 1973, we’d played Celtic in a few semi-finals and they were all very close games.“We were never really hammered in any of them but they just had that wee bit more experience of playing in semi-finals and winning them.“We had experience of losing semi-finals.“Psychologically that’s a big thing, whereas when you get to a final it’s different.“We were, obviously, the underdogs – with that there’s nothing to lose, just go out and play, do your best and hope it’s good enough.“You need wee breaks, too, and we got them.”In the midst of the miner’s strike, the 1973 final was an eerie affair with just 27,974 spectators braving the snowy conditions.Striker Gordon Wallace got the all-important goal late on to secure the trophy for the Dark Blues.Scott added: “Rab Wilson played it up to Gordon Wallace.“He had Pat McCluskey at his back but he took it down on his chest and in one movement hit it low into the corner.“The goalie was taken by surprise with the quickness Gordon hit it.“It was a typical striker’s goal, instinctive, didn’t think – bang.“We scored and went ahead – I don’t think we did that in any of the semi-finals we played, we were always having to fight back. We scored first and had something to build on.“It wasn’t like we scored and sat back and defended for 60 minutes or we were fortunate or anything.“We’d had a go at them, played well in defence and attack. It wasn’t a smash-and-grab win, we deserved it.“We were good enough to go on and win more trophies but, unfortunately, we didn’t. It was a good side with good players, individually and collectively.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b715bb7ee0-788x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc the big days in dark blues history books","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most provincial clubs, for Dundee, trophies are a welcome bonus, not a given.In their 125-year history, the Dark Blues have lifted major domestic silverware on five occasions, though not since their League Cup win of 1973.Their first success came 17 years after the club was formed, in the shape of the 1910 Scottish Cup – the only time they’ve lifted the country’s most prestigious knockout trophy.In typical fashion, the one time Dundee did win it, it was the hard way.The first round saw them held by Beith, technically away from home but actually at Dens Park after the opposition surrendered home advantage, before winning the replay 1-0.A crowd of 20,000 then saw them take care of Falkirk at the first time of asking and it was the same with Motherwell in the third round.In the semi-finals they needed three games before beating Hibs by the only goal of the entire tie at Parkhead.That set up what was to be an epic final against Clyde, the side who would finish just above them in the First Division that season.Game one of an Ibrox triple header ended in a 2-2 draw on April 9 and, when the teams met again seven days later, there was no scoring.Dundee were finally able to kiss silver for the first time on April 20, 1910, when goals from Jimmy Bellamy and John ‘Sailor’ Hunter saw them edge out the Bully Wee by 2-1.That sparked off wild celebrations and although that second replay was a midweek game, the team were mobbed when they arrived back home by train late in the evening.Despite a few near things, it was to be 41 years before the fans were able to welcome another trophy to the city.That was when the side put together by director/manager George Anderson, and that was inspired by Scotland inside- forward Billy Steel, went all the way in the League Cup.Having edged out Hearts in the group stage, they beat Falkirk 2-1 over the two legs of the quarter-finals. A one-sided 5-1 success over Motherwell at Ibrox in the last four set up a clash with Rangers at Hampden. The Gers were favourites but this was a Dundee side that feared no one. They showed that with a 3-2 victory.After failing to live up to being favourites when they faced Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final later that season, the next campaign saw them again win the League Cup.This time they cruised a group made up of Clyde, Raith and Airdrie and, although they lost the first leg in the quarters against Stirling Albion 3-1, back at Dens a 5-0 success saw them through.Hibs were then taken care of in the semis and the final against Kilmarnock was a fairly routine affair, a Bobby Flavell double being enough retain the trophy.Nine years later came Dundee’s most glorious day when, under the guidance of Bob Shankly, a fantastic season was crowned by clinching the club’s only league title.It came at Muirton Park, where a 3-0 win over St Johnstone – who were relegated – saw them beat off the challenge of Rangers in what, until that final day, had been a nip-and-tuck race.The league was won with the use of just 15 players, though with the likes of Alan Gilzean, Alex Hamilton, Ian Ure, Andy Penman and skipper Bobby Cox in the line-up, it was a special team.It was back to the League Cup for the last major success and, if the 1973 triumph is not the most talked about of the five, it was a laudable achievement. It came during the time of the three-day week and power cuts, meaning the final had an early kick-off to save power, so attracted a crowd of just 27,974.The game was decided by a solitary late goal from the prolific Gordon Wallace and if many reports make it sound forgettable, it should be remembered victory was over a Hoops side that would go on to reach the European Cup semi-finals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/976302492.jpg-279x180.jpg ","title":"argentina cant expect messi to carry them says dundee hero caniggia","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee star Claudio Caniggia has urged the current Argentina side not to be a one-man team in Russia this summer.The Argentines got their World Cup campaign under way on Saturday against Iceland but could only manage a draw.Today they face Croatia and will hope to kick-start their campaign.Caniggia went to three World Cups – almost returning for a fourth at the age of 42 in 2010 – and arrived to much fanfare at Dundee in 2000.He says his country’s best chance of winning it all for the first time since 1986 is if Lionel Messi’s supporting cast step up to the plate.The 51-year-old rose to international prominence during the 1990 World Cup in Italy alongside Argentina great Diego Maradona and insists the difference between that side and today’s is the expectation on the other players.Caniggia said: “Messi doesn’t get the same support from his team-mates Maradona did.“I knew Maradona was the complete footballing genius but I didn’t think about keeping up with him. Never.“Every player has a responsibility, even those who don’t play much.“You can’t give all the responsibility to Messi, because then what’s the point of you being there?“Imagine if I’d thought in 1990 the world champions had to carry me through. No! Carry us? We’re in it together.“I’m Argentina’s striker and I have to drag them through it, too.“That was my responsibility. You’ve got to have character, determination, ambition and impulse.”Argentina are fifth in the betting to lift the trophy and Caniggia believes they can do it, particularly with the talent they have up top.With Messi, Gonzalo Higuain – who has come under fire for his performances for his country – Sergio Aguero, Paulo Dybala and Angel Di Maria to choose from, goals shouldn’t be a problem. Defensively, however, they could come unstuck.“What’s in our favour is the best attacking players can put fear into anyone,” added Caniggia.“Their names alone unsettle the opposition. The other teams don’t think ‘Higuain is being criticised in Argentina’. They think: ‘he’s Juventus’ top goalscorer’.”“Our weak point is we’re still not solid at the back, and there are still a couple of places up for grabs.”Caniggia was in his early thirties by the time he arrived at Dens Park in 2000 and remarkably had the chance to play at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.“We’ll never know now but to play 30 minutes would have been perfect. I was in good shape and I hadn’t lost my pace. But I couldn’t decide, and later I regretted it. It would’ve been unbelievable to play.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"convincing players to come to dundee united has not been easy admits csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo admits getting the players he wants to rebuild Dundee United this summer has not been easy.But he’s revealed the more quality signings that have been made, the less difficult the process has become.With other clubs, often from top divisions, also keen on players like Callum Booth, Craig Curran and Frederic Frans, the Tangerines had to pull out the stops to persuade them to sign up at Tannadice.That saw Csaba making a point of speaking to every potential target individually, rather than doing business through their agents.“If we are in the Premiership it is easier to attract staff and players, but we are not,” he said.“I have talked to every single player we have signed to convince them to come to Dundee United.“It was not an agent calling them to tell them Dundee United were interested, it was the manager calling to say you are important.“I think this was a reason why we’ve got players. It’s a lot of work and it’s not finished.“Frans and Booth both had offers from Premiership clubs here, Frans also from the top division in Belgium.“They have come here and, when other players see that, it made it better for us to get others to come as well.”Csaba has also revealed not one of the new faces had a problem with the new 25-miles rule he’s introduced.From now on, every player will have to stay no further away from Tannadice than that and, contrary to what some predicted, it’s not been a problem.“Before it could be Willo Flood, myself and some directors travelling on the team

The locals also look forward to our arrival – they always say they know it’s summer when they see our marquee going up.“But without a means of feeding the troops we had to cancel the camp.”Mr Fordyce, who has been with the Boys’ Brigade since 1977, said the response from the Inverbervie community had left him overwhelmed.A 20-foot container is being brought on site to be used for storage and the local church has also offered the company a place to serve food. The cottage will eventually be repaired when pest control specialists are brought in to deal with birds which are now nesting in the building.“It’s our eight-day camp and the boys have been looking forward to it all year,” said Mr Fordyce.“Now the camp can go ahead and there will be an added sense of pride when we march through Inverbervie this year.“Everyone who has chipped in has been absolutely brilliant and we are eternally grateful.”The appeal was started after Mr Fordyce contacted Lynn McHarg from Inverbervie Burgh Hall.She said those responsible had given a terrible impression of Bervie to the wider community.“Bervie is so much more than this mindless vandalism,” she said.Police Scotland are investigating.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/Levon-Anderson-e1529677757899-526x564.jpg ","title":"pervert used mobile phone to film women in toilet at dundee nightclub","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA nightclub voyeur has admitted hiding in a cubicle in the female toilets and filming women “in a state of undress” in the neighbouring loo.Levon Anderson was placed on the sex offenders register after admitting the offence at Dundee Sheriff Court.The court heard that a woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had gone to the toilet at the city’s Club Tropicana when she spotted a mobile phone being held close to the floor, poking through from the next cubicle.Fiscal depute Kate Irwin told the court: “She saw the mobile phone being held under the partition separating the cubicles.“She attempted to seize possession of the phone but it was retracted back into the other cubicle.“The witness waited in the bathroom for around five minutes until the accused exited the cubicle.

The southern half of the UK will push towards 30C.“Last year, the warmest level we saw was 19.5C.“From what we’re seeing it looks as though there’s going to be no end in sight to the good weather in the Tayside region.”Dundee regularly clocks up more hours of sunshine than any other city in Scotland.

National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on narrow pavements forcing pedestrians onto the road.The coalition want the council to adopt a Street Charter which would dictate conditions to be applied to any future planning or licensing applications.RNIB Scotland campaigns manager Dr Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality

welcoming to everyone \u0026ndash and the key to inclusivity is physical accessibility.\"She added: \"A Street Charter would help to avoid entrenching flawed designs that could blemish Inverness for a generation or more.\"Brian MacKenzie of the Highland Cycle Campaign said\u0026nbsp the drive to get things right first time made good financial sense for cash-strapped local authorities.\"For example, a 2015 House of Lords report on \u0026lsquoshared spaces\u0026rsquo (where roads and pavements are levelled allowing vehicles and pedestrians to use the same area) warns that \u0026lsquocouncils are risking public safety with fashionable simplified street design\u0026rsquo and notes that \u0026lsquomore and more local authorities are forced into expensive remedial work, often restoring crossings they have themselves removed\u0026rsquo,\" he said.The manifesto states: \"A Street Charter would offer planners and consultants a template for inclusive design, potentially saving the council money by cutting down on objections to plans or completed developments.\"And it adds: \"A Street Charter would also make for a more pleasant environment for people who don\u0026rsquot have disabilities as

The connection with the charity came about because Andrew is father-in-law to a friend of Emily Crossley, a former reporter and anchor for Channel 4 News and CNN International, who co-founded the charity in 2012 after her son Eli was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. (DMD)Emily has advocated for patients around the world and spoken many times in the Houses of Parliament.The trust raised \u0026pound3.5million in its first three years, and then six years ago started the annual Duchenne Dash, which with big sponsors such as Maserati, brings in millions for research and also raises awareness of the horrible disease. Last year\u0027 Dash raised \u0026pound1 million.DMD is an inherited genetic disorder passed on by the mother that leads to progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. Symptom onset is usually between ages three and five and the disease primarily affects boys, although in rare cases it can affect girls.Sonia, who completed this year\u0027 Loch Ness Etape as part of her training, said: \"Every week, two families in the UK are given the devastating news that their son has DMD, and we believe there are at least two cases in the north.\"The Paris dash is to raise money for research and raise awareness.

He said: “The kids get really engaged, so they’re doing schoolwork without having to do work.“It’s about getting them to do things that they don’t necessarily want to do.”A spokesman for the competition said: “We had the most teams ever participating with 40 schools attending.“Each school had their own unique take on their body work design and we would like to congratulate them as they each took part with great sportsmanship, despite the wet conditions.“It wouldn’t have been possible without our wonderful sponsor TAQA and their incredible volunteers.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sloman knocks out red hot wilco at windy amateur championship","story":"\t\t\t\t\t“I don’t tend to play my home course when it’s this windy to be honest.“I stay home and play the Playstation”These were the words of Englishman Tom Sloman, 21, after he held his nerve best in the gale to reach the fourth round of the Amateur Championship at Royal Aberdeen.Sloman, a plus-four handicapper, saw off the week’s stand-out performer Wilco Nienaber by one hole yesterday after the big South African, 18, put his short par putt on the last just past the hole.The Taunton and Pickerage member, commenting of the blustery conditions at Balgownie and his great week so far – he was tied for 14th in the strokeplay stage at two-over – added: “I hit two wedges. One (on the second hole) was from 100 yards and it went 60 yards right.“I don’t think I’ve hit a bad shot.“It was a slug-fest out there today, but I was only four or five-over-par.“I didn’t have any expectations coming into this week and I always just try and play golf and it’s worked so far.”Sloman was set to take on another South African, Ernie Els’ nephew Jovan Rebula, in the quarter-finals today for a shot in the semis.It was a bad day for South Africa overall, with five of their players in the fourth round draw, but only one left at the end of play.Rebula beat Howley Hall’s Ben Hutchison by one hole to seal his progress.Elsewhere, Portmarnock’s Conor Purcell, after knocking out world number six Matthew Jordan by holing a 35-yard pitch from the rough on the 19th hole in the morning, defeated Adam Blomme of Sweden 3\u0026amp2.The 21-year-old Irishman, who grew up at Portmarnock, where his dad was pro, said his wonder pitch was “hit and hope”.The 58-degree wedge sent the ball over a bunker and then it rolled into the cup.After the later win, which sent him into the quarter-finals, Purcell said: “I’m surpassing whatever I thought I could I do, but I’ll keep playing my own game and see how things work out.“You can’t get ahead of yourself.”Purcell was set to take on David Micheluzzi, of Australia, today. The Royal Melbourne man beat Mexico’s Raul Pereda.Meanwhile, Filton’s Mitch Waite was set to play Sweden’s Christoffer Palsson and Tramore’s Robin Dawson was drawn against Kinsale’s John Murphy in all-Irish clash.Saturday’s winner over 36 holes at Royal Aberdeen is not only playing for an impressive trophy.A win in the 123rd edition of the competition will also them a place in the Open Championship and at next year’s Masters and US Open.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 20/05/18, 3:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.News of £36m funding to support walking and cycling announced by Transport Minister Humza Yousaf is to be welcomed, albeit part of an £80million funding pot already allocated.Far too often, we experience how sharing roads among pedestrians, cyclists and motorists leads to unwanted collisions that could have been prevented had the road conditions and visibility been better. Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads. Now the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers. And Ben’s dad James said: “I am immensely proud of them both. “Too often people these days would just walk past and, although concerned, would not intervene. “Ben and Max got stuck in and worked out a rescue plan.” The 12-year-olds, who have just started second year at Kyle Academy, had been out cycling in Rozelle Park last Tuesday.  They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Borders Book Festival organisers say events going ahead  as normal ","story":"ORGANISERS of the Borders Book Festival have said\u0026nbspall events

weight limit has been removed, leaving all vehicles able to use the crossing.\nOver the first few days motorists are asked to drive carefully as they get used to travelling over the bridge once again.\nBus services which used the crossing before it closed will also return to using the B6374 road on Saturday, June 16.\nScottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, councillor Gordon Edgar (Ind) said: \u0026ldquoWe firstly need to thank local residents, businesses and commuters for their patience during the closure of Lowood Bridge.\n\u0026ldquoWe knew this closure would cause disruption locally over an extended period of time but the project team and the local contractors have worked very hard to ensure the project finished ahead of schedule despite the heavy snow we had in February and March.\n\u0026ldquoThe Council is aware of the importance of Lowood Bridge which is why it carried out these works as part of a programme of bridge repairs across the Borders to maintain the structure for many years to come.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders to benefit from   1 3m energy efficiency funding","story":"BORDERERS are set to benefit

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm - it  39 s only the Common Riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son.

This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"United front to boost the Borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year. Views were sought on the Borderlands\u0026rsquo key themes: Digital Energy Destination Borderlands Rural Productivity Business Growth Transport Innovation and Skills and Quality of Place.\nThe conference had backing from both governments who have pledged support for a deal.\nKeith Brown MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work, said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has made clear our support for a proposed Borderlands deal in our budget statements. And we look forward to negotiating the detail of that deal when the partners are ready with their proposals. This is a key part of our commitment to 100 percent coverage of deals across Scotland.\n\u0026ldquoWe want to see an ambitious deal that focuses on driving inclusive growth and the priorities that will make a difference and help the economy thrive. We want a deal that helps address the area\u0026rsquos connectivity challenges, supports growth in sectors particularly important in the Borderlands, and creates more opportunities for all to attract people to the area.\n\u0026ldquoWe are working to tackle the economic challenges in the South of Scotland, having already committed to establishing a South of Scotland enterprise agency, and we want to ensure that priorities align to maximise impact and success.\nSpeaking ahead of the conference the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell said:\n\"The Borderlands Growth Deal represents a unique opportunity to provide a real shot in the arm to the economy of our region, a region that faces similar challenges wherever you live or work within it.\n\u0026ldquoWorking with the proposals that have been prepared by local authorities, businesses and individuals, we will spend the summer shaping these in to a coherent deal that will support the economy of the region by encouraging people to invest in new opportunities, by building on our strengths and improving the lives of those who live here.\n\u0026ldquoIn that way, we will bring to the Borderlands the benefits that are now being seen across the UK as investment in City and Growth Deals progresses.\nDumfries and Galloway Council Chief Executive Gavin Stevenson said: \u0026ldquoCrucially we now sit between the emerging powerhouses of the central belt of Scotland and the Northern Powerhouse in England. Unless we act they will continue to suck up our young talent and skills.\n\u0026ldquoWe need to re-position ourselves, we need to stabilise and to stop our productivity falling and then we also need to reinvent. This feels like a once in a generation opportunity.\n\u0026ldquoWe know our potential, our children will not forgive us if there are no jobs in the future. I think we are at that point where we either put up or shut up. We get out there, we shout, we demand and we create the business opportunities.\nThose attending quizzed a panel, chaired by the UK Government\u0026rsquos Borderlands champion John Stevenson MP, on how the deal could support inclusivity, tourism projects and benefit small rural communities.\nFor more information visit the partnership website www.Borderlandsgrowth or email info@borderlandsgrowth\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Youngsters make a splash at Braw Lads  39  Swimming Gala","story":"SPECTATORS crammed into Galashiels Swimming Pool on Tuesday night for the Braw Lads\u0027 Swimming Gala.\nBraw Lad Greg Kelly, Braw Lass Kimberley O\u0027May and their attendants were given a rousing welcome as they came to support the young competitors.\nAnd the swimmers from all age groups put on a fantastic display throughout the evening, which culminated with the mixed aged group Braw Lads\u0027 Relay Race.\nThis event didn\u0027t disappoint.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.

Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.

Plans to close Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School were revealed last autumn.  East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.  Current headteacher Seonaid McGillivray is set to be appointed at another as yet unnamed school in the county, with the final details expected to be tied up within a matter of days.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.  She added: \u0026ldquoI would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs McGillivray for her service and leadership of King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School and more recently Haddington Infant School.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road. Mr Dickie said \u0026ldquoother retailers were interested in that site and they were looking to progress plans \u0026ldquorelatively quickly."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7919368.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Call for community to invest in Humbie wind farm","story":"              A COMMUNITY energy project is urging investors to back a project which will operate 12 wind turbines near Humbie and help tackle fuel poverty.  The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement. Increasing the scope for all members of the school community, including parents, partners and children, to be involved in discussions about aspects of the life and work of the school.  The quality indicators for the primary school showed a \u0027good\u0027 result for: leadership of change learning, teaching and assessment and raising attainment and achievement. The school achieved \u0027very good\u0027 for ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.  The nursery received a \u0027good\u0027 quality indicator across the board for: leadership of change learning, teaching and assessment securing children\u0027s progress and ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \"I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the school staff and pupils for their hard work in achieving positive outcomes for children and their families.  \"I wish to thank Sarah Ogden in particular, our headteacher, for the strength of leadership and commitment that she has shown in recent months for the school to achieve this positive recognition.  \"I am pleased to report that Education Scotland has advised us that no further inspections are planned at the school.  \"I am also delighted to report that the school has made good progress with the areas for improvement identified within the report.  Councillor Katie Mackie, ward member for Musselburgh on East Lothian Council, said: \"This is an excellent result and well-deserved. The commitment of staff and great relationship between pupils and teachers is in clear evidence when you visit the school.\"  Miles Briggs, Lothian MSP, said: \"The attainment of either \u0027good\u0027 or \u0027very good\u0027 for all quality indicators is an exceptionally good achievement.  \"Pinkie St. Peters has gone from strength to strength and I wish them continued success for the next academic year.\""},{"url":null,"title":"PHOTOS  Fancy dress charity walk in Musselburgh","story":"              THERE was a lot of clowning around at a fancy dress charity walk in Musselburgh on Saturday.  Organised by the darts team at The Riverside Tavern, the event was one of several held throughout the year which raised a total of \u0026pound7,787.  The cash was divided between Prostate Scotland, which helps prostate cancer sufferers, and ward 1, unit 4, oncology, for patients with cancer at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh \u0026ndash each receiving \u0026pound3,893.  The latter was chosen as the darts team\u0026rsquos captain, Michael Burgess, was treated there for leukaemia.  \u0026ldquoI wanted to give something back as they really looked after us, he said.  The walk was the pub\u0026rsquos fourth and final charity event of the year and followed a bowls competition, eight-hour darts marathon and darts competition. Participants walked six miles from The Riverside to Portobello via the promenade.  In April, a thief stole the pub\u0026rsquos collection bottle containing about \u0026pound400 but local taxi owner John Cullen stepped in to hold a bonus ball fundraiser when he heard about the break-in.  Over 32 years, the pub\u0026rsquos darts team has raised more than \u0026pound100,000 for different charities. Led by John Campbell from Whitecraig, the players have held everything from collections to 12-hour darts marathons and competitions, and annual fancy dress sponsored walks during their time based at the Deantown Bowling Club and former Dolphin Inn at Whitecraig, and now The Riverside.  Mr Campbell said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod like to thank everyone who supported our events."},{"url":null,"title":"Musselburgh mum recovering after losing feet to sepsis","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH mum-of-two\u0026nbspwho cheated death after contracting life-threatening sepsis is now on the road to recovery.  Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.  Current school times: Dunbar Grammar School starts at 8.40am with a home time of 3.50pm Monday to Thursday and 12.30pm on Fridays Preston Lodge High School starts at 8.40am and finishes at 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.25pm on Fridays Knox Academy is 8.44am to 4pm Monday to Thursday, finishing at 12.05pm on Fridays Musselburgh Grammar School starts at 8.45am, finishing at 3.50pm and 12.30pm on Fridays North Berwick High School starts at 8.39am and finishes at 3.50pm \u0026ndash noon on Fridays Ross High School starts at 8.30am, finishing at 3.35pm \u0026ndash 11.55am on Fridays."},{"url":null,"title":"Ormiston Park formally opens after years of refurbishment work","story":"              SUPPORTERS of Ormiston Park celebrated its official opening on Saturday following four years of hard work.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":null,"title":"Open-top tourist bus tours of East Lothian to start this summer","story":"              A NEW bus service that will serve East Lothian\u0027s tourist attractions will be launched at the end of the month.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times. I was pleased that the surgery has recognised this and was in a position to give me a briefing on the situation.\"  He said doctors were now up to their full staffing level of 14 and an additional four staff members to take phone calls were in the process of being recruited.  During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7961303.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Fox  PM is not bluffing over    no deal    Brexit stance","story":"              Theresa May is not \u0026ldquobluffing by saying she is prepared to walk away from the European Union without a deal, Liam Fox said.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.  The National Lottery Millionaire report also reveals that gifting to friends, family and charity remains the top priority for winners, with a further 1,750 millionaires created by winners sharing their wealth."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7927047.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Hollywood star Johnny Depp reveals who his Scots hero is during Glasgow visit","story":"              Johnny Depp might have brought rock \u0026rsquon\u0026rsquo roll to Glasgow with old pals Alice Cooper and Joe Perry \u0026ndash but he told Scots fans his own hero was William Wallace.\u0026nbsp  The Edward Scissorhands actor was looking healthy as he rocked up to the SSE Hydro in a four-car convoy.\u0026nbsp  And he showed off some fine vocals during the Hollywood Vampire Set, particularly during a David Bowie Heroes tribute.\u0026nbsp  During his \u0026pound1000-a-head meet-and-greet he chatted away with locals and told them he loved whisky.

Here\u0027s our writers\u0027 choices - now we want to know yours.  Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989  Just seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. Over 25 years, it has offered me endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Heaven and Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990  There were few exotic sounds in early 1990s Glenrothes, but Liz Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack soaring from my bedroom from was one of them. This most accessible of the Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is awash with blissed-out grandeur, each exquisite track creating a world all of its own.  High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983  Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth, and reimagined them as the perfectly-crafted jangle-heavy creations he gave to the world. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  Marianne Taylor  Hope Is Important, Idlewild, 1998  Before they went all REM, Woomble and co produced this startling explosion of singalong hooks, soft-loud dynamics and crashing guitars with one song (A Film For The Future) that could sum up manic pop rock thrills for aliens.  Django Django, Django Django, 2012  Their insatiable rockabilly-tinged surf rock is a staple on my playlist and while the latest album has two of their best tunes, their Mercury-nominated debut was the real eyeopener.    Architect, C Duncan, 2015  The debut bedroom-produced, genre-hopping classical-meets-dream pop meets-space folk, featuring harmonies straight out of The Carpenters songbook, remains an ear-opening wonder that deserved to win the Mercury.  Martin Williams  City to City, Gerry Rafferty, 1978.  Not so much for the two big hits, Baker Street and Right Down the Line, but more for Whatever\u0026rsquos Written in Your Heart. Rafferty at his introspective best.  Listen to City to City  A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984  Tinseltown in the Rain, of course, from the band\u0026rsquos debut album. There\u0026rsquos Killermont Street by Aztec Camera but Tinseltown is the ode to Glasgow.  On Stolen Stationary, Michael Marra, 1991  Hermless. Marra at his witty best. The ultimate self-effacing anthem for our national football team. Such mischievous fun, too.  Barclay McBain  Treasure, The Cocteau Twins, 1984  I was a devout follower of John Peel\u0026rsquos radio show, a late-night portal to a different dimension and it was here I first heard the strange, ethereal, beguiling sounds of Liz Fraser and the Cocteau Twins, beamed through into my bedroom and my brain, like the best alien invasion ever. Not only was Liz from Earth, however, she was from Grangemouth, just down the road. After 30-odd years of listening, I still have absolutely no idea what she\u0026rsquos singing about, nor do I care. Just turn it up and let me dream.  Songs from Northern Britain, Teenage Fanclub, 1997  A long, long time ago, at a festival not too far from here, a man thrust a microphone in my face and asked me what Teenage Fanclub meant to me. In the second it took me to open my mouth to reply, they vanished. Collecting my thoughts from the comfort of a chemical toilet, I mused on the question. They are the band equivalent of your best friend, a constant. Always there, always dependable, the soundtrack to your greatest triumphs and most crushing defeats, they have your back, always ready with a smile and a hug. Cheers, pals.    The Three EPS, The Beta Band, 1998  Ok, so technically not an album, but three EPs gathered together for your listening pleasure. When John Cusack\u0026rsquos character in the film High Fidelity puts the Three Eps in his record shop, customers stop in their tracks. What\u0026rsquos this? they ask, \u0026ldquoit\u0026rsquos good! To which Cusack replies, smugly, I know. If only everyone did.  Lian Thomson  Sulk, The Associates, 1982  Of course, as any fool knows, 1982 is the annus mirabilis of Scottish pop (the fact that I was 19 that year may or may not be related). Above all else there was Sulk, the highpoint of new pop (alongside ABC\u0026rsquos Lexicon of Love), and Dundee\u0026rsquos finest gift to the culture. Alan Rankine and Billy McKenzie made pop music that was wilder, stranger and, yes, sexier, than everyone else that year. Party Fears Two is a song that is a song that teeters on the cusp of madness and is giddy at the very thought of it. It\u0026rsquos not even the best thing on the album.  Bones You Have Thrown Me and Blood I\u0026rsquove spilled, Kathryn Joseph, 2015  Because I believe every word she sings.  I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, Trashcan Sinatras, 1993  Presuming that Lloyd Cole\u0026rsquos Commotion-less albums don\u0026rsquot qualify (if they did, then Don\u0026rsquot Get Weird on Me would be a shoo-in), let\u0026rsquos go with the second album from Ayrshire\u0026rsquos finest exports. I\u0026rsquom not sure it\u0026rsquos better than their precocious debut Cake, but the bittersweet autumnal yearning of Earlies is the most gorgeous Scottish song no one has heard of.  Teddy Jamieson  This Is The Story, The Proclaimers, 1987  Its seminal track Letter From America was a soaring cry of solidarity for beleaguered working class communities across Scotland. The line \u0026ldquoBathgate no more \u0026ndash referring to the British Leyland plant which closed in 1984 \u0026ndash made this West Lothian youngster feel like someone was listening.  Listen to\u0026nbspLetter from America:\u0026nbsp  Popped In Souled Out, Wet Wet Wet, 1987  Ah, heady gems such as Wishing I Was Lucky, Angel Eyes and Sweet Little Mystery crooned by dreamboat Marti Pellow (err, what? I was nine). I played this album so often that the tape inside the cassette stretched and snapped. I saved up my pocket money and bought another.  The Hush, Texas, 1999  It was the soundtrack to my first newspaper job as a trainee reporter at the Basingstoke Gazette, the smoky-voiced tones of Sharleen Spiteri \u0026ndash singing Summer Son and In Our Lifetime \u0026ndash played through the tinny headphones of my Sony Discman.    Susan Swarbrick  All You Need Is\u0026hellip.Love and Money, Love and Money, 1986  Because it was the first album I ever owned (on cassette) because I loved James Grant\u0026rsquos voice and because it was a bit edgy and angry and I wasn\u0026rsquot either of those things, normally. It made me feel a bit dangerous.  Fruits of Passion, Fruits of Passion, 1987  A sadly-neglected pure pop classic \u0026ndash why oh why, did this wonderful band get left behind when the likes of Texas, Deacon Blue and Del Amitri soared? Pure, perfect vocals and singalong joy.  Listen to Kiss Me Now  Creeping up on Jesus, The Big Dish, 1988  I know it wasn\u0026rsquot as well received as their first album, Swimmer, but I always liked the happy, poppy feel of this one and it reminds me of driving around the north of Scotland in the summer sunshine with my love, when we were young and free as birds\u0026hellip  Ann Fotheringham  Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991  It was not their first album, but Bandwagonesque thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is this Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  The Beta Band, The Three Eps, 1998  Though technically a compilation, this laid out their manifesto more than any album from this cult Scots combo \u0026ndash a gloriously languid, ramshackle assembly of loose, off-kilter tunes, embroidered with hints of funk and electronica. They have never sounded better.  Music Has The Right To Children, Boards of Canada, 1998  The debut album of Scots electronic duo Boards of Canada is, for many, the high watermark for ambient electronic music. Two decades on from its release, its influence continues to be recognised and celebrated \u0026ndash and rightly so.  Scott Wright  Screamadelica, Primal Scream, 1991  It sounded in 1991 like it was made in the future and in 2018 it could have been recorded yesterday. Movin\u0026rsquo on Up really ought to be the national anthem. Stands out on its own.  Listen to Loaded  Grand Prix, Teenage Fanclub, 1995  Bellshill meets the US West Coast with predictably dreamy results. There is not a weak track on it and some of the lyrics would make a statue well up.  Psychocandy, The Jesus and Marychain, 1985  It wasn\u0026rsquot all madness and fighting in the Reid family. This album sees them flirt with the Beach Boys and, pun intended, they pull it off. Just Like Honey is perfection.  Neil Cameron  The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008  A decision to avoid albums detailing the painful end of a long-term relationship after the end of my own stopped me listening to Midnight Organ Fight for a few years, but diving back in was like meeting an old friend in the pub. It\u0026rsquos painful but cathartic. Like all of the late Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.  I Am An Island, Fatherson, 2014  My first experience of drinking alcohol was at a Fatherson gig in our hometown of Kilmarnock circa 2009, so their music has always been riddled with nostalgia for me. Their debut album is special because it taps into that difficult phase of growing up in, and moving out of, a small town that can sometimes feel desperate to pull you back.  The Bones of What You Believe, Chvrches, 2013  The juxtaposition of pop melodies and dark lyrics is the USP of this album, which can be appreciated on both a surface level and deeper, with every move having been intricately created by the three musicians. Lauren Mayberry brings a new a level of vulnerability to the genre which makes Chvrches stand out from the rest.  Holly Lennon  Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989  Heartache, the joy of human connection and a love letter to rainy Glasgow by night from a voice wrought with emotion. I\u0026rsquom forever grateful to my brother, Ewen, for the first hearing of the Downtown Lights, beyond his bedroom door.  Garbage, Garbage, 1995  Thrilling soundtrack to the giddy, alcohol-fuelled anticipation of student nights out, sung by the first cool ginger frontwoman I had ever seen.  These Streets, Paolo Nutini, 2006  The ache of leaving home and impermanence of first love refreshingly articulated in Nutini\u0026rsquos Paisley brogue with a maturity beyond his years.    Caroline Wilson  Solid Air, John Martyn, 1973  Superb guitar playing, great songs and Martyn\u0026rsquos trademark slurred jazzy vocals make this a fascinating album, like nothing we\u0026rsquod ever heard before. Martyn had star quality and talent in abundance but he also had a self-destructive streak and simply did what he liked, on and off stage, and never made the \u0026ldquobig time. He made other great albums, notably One World, but this is him at his peak.  Listen to Solid Air  White Album, Average White Band, 1974  Great songs, astonishing double lead vocal from Alan Gorrie and Hamish Stuart, fabulous funky drumming from Robbie McIntosh and the Dundee Horns of Ball on Pick Up The Pieces, this topped both the UK and US charts. Black American artists couldn\u0026rsquot believe the band were white, never mind Scottish, when they heard it. Still a classic 44 years on.  Sunshine on Leith, The Proclaimers, 1988  A clutch of superb self-written songs, the Reid twins singing in their own accents (very unusual back then), a great session band and Pete Wingfield\u0026rsquos sensitive production turned this into a classic. Hell, they even made a musical and film based on it. Thirty years on and we\u0026rsquore still singing along with the choruses.  Frank Morgan  Exploited, Troops of Tomorrow, 1982  \u0026ldquoSomething\u0026rsquos happened/what\u0026rsquos gone wrong/Going down the dole/got to sign on/Millions of kids with nowt to do/You better watch out they\u0026rsquore after you. It\u0026rsquos 1982, the country is falling apart and Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Wattie Buchan and Big John Duncan have the perfect response. Fast, angry, hardcore punk.  Twilight Sad, Forget the Night Ahead, 2009  An uncompromising post-rock wall of sound, with uncompromising Scottish accents. Like nothing I\u0026rsquod heard before. What The Proclaimers would sound like if they were a Chem19 band channelling Nine Inch Nails.  Test Dept, Brith Gof, Gododdin, 1989  Pipes and drums and tribal soul \u0026ndash this was the sound of Europe\u0026rsquos ancient minorities refusing to fade away. Angus Farquhar\u0026rsquos finest musical moment before coming a full-time arts revolutionary with NVA.  Garry Scott  I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, Trashcan Sinatras, 1993  From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  Avocet, Bert Jansch, 1979  One for the diaspora. Released as punk morphed into post-punk and new wave, the Edinburgh-born guitarist\u0026rsquos 12th studio album came from another world entirely. Around the theme of wading birds he weaves a fabric of folk, jazz and improvised playing that never loses its capacity to enthral.  Bones You Have Thrown Me and Blood I\u0026rsquove Spilled, Kathryn Joseph, 2015  Irrefutable evidence that the best music doesn\u0026rsquot belong to the distant past, Glasgow-based Aberdonian Kathryn Joseph\u0026rsquos hard-won success with her debut was fuelled in equal measure by her powerfully emotional music, glorious enthusiasm and unwillingness to mask the fact that when you reach 40 there\u0026rsquos some baggage you either can\u0026rsquot or don\u0026rsquot want to leave behind, so best use it to stoke the fire of creativity.

The figure was more than twice the \u0026pound191m underspend of the year before.  Announcing the outturn figure for 2017-18, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay told MSPs the fiscal budget had been \u0026pound31.4bn, but expenditure \u0026pound30.9bn.  However he stressed most of the unspent money was already committed, including \u0026pound100m for a new social security system, and all the money would be spent by the Scottish Government, not returned to the Treasury.  He said that for the second year running, income from devolved taxes was up, with total provisional income from Land \u0026amp Buildings Transactions Tax and Scottish Landfill Tax reaching \u0026pound706m, \u0026pound50m above forecasts, and \u0026pound73 million, or 12 per cent, up on 2016-2017.  He said that the net extra being carried forward into 2018/19 was \u0026pound66m, or just 0.2 per cent of the overall fiscal budget, and that this would be done through the Scotland Reserve pot, making it available \u0026ldquoto support management of future budget volatility.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe 2017-18 provisional outturn results show that once again the Scottish Government has prudently and competently managed Scotland\u0026rsquos finances.  \u0026ldquoUnder the current devolution settlement, the Scottish Parliament is not permitted to overspend its budget. As a consequence, we have consistently adopted a position of controlling public expenditure to ensure we live within the budget control limits that apply.  \u0026ldquoThese underspends represent a fraction of our overall budget, but will be carried forward to support this year\u0026rsquos budget and increase our reserves.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue to maintain a firm grip on Scotland\u0026rsquos public finances to mitigate the negative impact Brexit will have on Scotland\u0026rsquos economic outlook.  Labour MSP James Kelly said the underspend was \u0026ldquonothing short of a scandal, given ministers had cut \u0026pound1.5bn from councils since 2011, and demanded Mr Mackay apologise to workers facing the axe while he sat on an \u0026ldquoSNP government slush fund.  He said: \u0026ldquoMoney is piling up in his slush fund for his annual bribe to win Green votes to get his budgets passed.  \u0026ldquoThis is simply a gross mismanagement of the Scottish finances by a Finance Secretary who is clearly out of his depth.

Earlier this week, the Nationalist leader in the Commons intensified the political rhetoric when he denounced the Scottish Secretary as \u0026ldquoyellow for not speaking in a debate and a \u0026ldquodismal failure in his role at the Scotland Office.  He accused Mr Mundell of \u0026ldquostabbing Scotland in the back over the devolved powers controversy, declaring: \u0026ldquoHe fails to stand up for Scotland as a country, fails to stand up for our Parliament, he sees us as subservient. That\u0027s why the Secretary of State needs to go. He is quite simply unfit for the office he holds.\"  Mr Blackford\u0026rsquos remarks came just days after he was ordered from the Commons by the Speaker and led a mass walkout of SNP MPs from the chamber.  Following the dramatic event, Mr Salmond, who himself walked out of the Commons during Chancellor Nigel Lawson\u0026rsquos 1988 Budget statement, suggested he had been the SNP\u0026rsquos inspiration by telling the party leader that targeting interventions on key occasions was the way to make a successful protest.  \"Certainly, that was my advice to Ian Blackford when he phoned me last Tuesday night and I was delighted to see him carry it through,\" explained the former First Minister.  But when the Highland MP was asked if Mr Salmond was pulling the party leadership\u0026rsquos strings at Westminster, he responded with a firm \u0026ldquoNo.  Mr Blackford also insisted his angry remarks directed at Mundell were not meant to be personal.  \u0026ldquoI was robust in how I spoke because the Secretary of State has failed to defend Scotland at every turn, he has been a complete failure, he declared.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot wish to be personal about the Secretary of State but on the lack of ability in serving Scotland\u0026rsquos interest, as defined by the Government itself, it is not good enough.  The party leader made clear he had not accused individual MPs of being \u0026ldquoanti-Scottish but, rather, Theresa May\u0026rsquos Government.  A Whitehall insider suggested the SNP leadership was losing the argument on the Brexit Bill, which was why it was resorting to \u0026ldquocheap personal attacks.  Meanwhile, as Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, and Michael Russell, her Brexit Minister, headed for Guernsey to attend the British-Irish Council, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office Minister, who will also be at the meeting, stressed how, despite the strong disagreements with Edinburgh over the Brexit Bill, the UK Government was committed to improving the depth of its co-operation with the SNP administration.  \u0026ldquoWhatever the inevitable political noise as we unpick the complexities of our membership of the EU, I will ensure that we maintain the depth of our ongoing engagement with the Scottish Government, including this week at the British-Irish Council in Guernsey. I hope that the Scottish Government will maintain their own side of that relationship.  He added: \u0026ldquoBy working together, we will help secure a deal that sees us leave the European Union as a more modern country where all four nations have their voices heard but also as one United Kingdom as the people of Scotland voted for in 2014."},{"url":null,"title":"Younger generation has little chance of becoming wealthy  report claims","story":"              Young people today have less chance of becoming truly wealthy than any previous post-war generations, according to a new report.  Whether or not they inherit sizeable assets from parents or other relatives will be the most important factor determining their eventual wealth, rather than ability or effort, analysts from the Resolution Foundation claim.  The report says big falls in home ownership rates since are a key factor in the wealth gap for young adults. Home ownership rates fell from 48 per cent in 2003 to 32 per cent today.  Typical Scottish wealth now totals \u0026pound237,000 per household, and the total household wealth in Scotland has now exceeded \u0026pound1 trillion for the first time, the report says.  Overall wealth in Scotland has grown from five times GDP to seven times GDP over the last decade, much faster than incomes which makes it harder to close wealth gaps by earning and saving.  Even a high income family, in the top ten per cent of households with a \u0026pound58,000 income would have to save every penny they earn for 19 years to become \"truly wealthy\" \u0026ndash with assets of over \u0026pound1 million\u0026ndash the report says.  But the reality is 25 per cent of Scots have savings of less than \u0026pound500, and seven per cent have savings of zero, or have current accounts in the red.  The Foundation is calling for politicians to take more account of wealth in policy-making and debates, and said that while reforms of council tax were welcome, it is one of the most significant wealth taxes. As it is devolved, the Scottish Government could do more to make it more accurately reflect property values, the report says.  Torsten Bell, Director of the Resolution foundation, said: \"Wealth in Scotland has grown fast in recent years and will come to play a bigger role in determining life chances in the decades to come.  \"This increase in wealth across Scotland has sat alongside falling home ownership rates, particularly for young families, who are struggling to accumulate wealth as preceding generations have been able to.\"  As a result the \u0027millennial\u0027 generation could be the first since the second world war to earn less than their parents over their lifetime.  \"The accumulation, distribution and taxation of wealth should be at the centre of policy debates in Scotland in the years ahead,\" Mr Bell added. \"If current trends continue it will become much harder in modern Scotland to earn your way to being truly wealth, and young people\u0027s prospects will depend lesson their ability and more on whether or not they inherit assets from relatives.\"  Neil Brennan, director of Fitzallan Ltd, Glasgow-based Chartered Financial Planners\u0026rsquo, said: \"Compared to previous generations, younger people typically stay at home longer, join the job market later and have very high expectations as to standard of living.\"  Many use disposable income for cars, holidays, leisure activities and fashion their parents might have done without, he said. \"Younger generations find it difficult to bridge the \u0026lsquowealth gap\u0026rsquo as they have low savings/high spending habits and do not get onto the housing market as early as their parents.\"  Pension auto-enrolment will help, but young people are starting work later and still do not begin saving for retirement as early as their parents did, he added.  \"As a financial adviser, we would encourage young people to save or investor contribute to pensions, even at modest levels, to get the \u0026lsquopot boiling\u0026rsquo.  \"Many younger people will have to rely on inheritances, even modest ones, to allow them to pay off their mortgages or retire before they are very old.\""},{"url":null,"title":"SNP  39 s Mike Russell    39 We don  39 t trust the UK Government  39  with Brexit preparation","story":"              Holyrood will not give consent to any further Brexit legislation until the \"broken\" devolution system is fixed, Scotland\u0027s Brexit Minister has indicated.  Mike Russell said the Scottish Government no longer trusted UK ministers following a breakdown in relations over the handling of the EU Withdrawal Bill.  He added that he \"couldn\u0027t conceive of circumstances\" where MSPs would vote to give approval for further legislation related to leaving the EU, such as trade, agriculture and fisheries.  MPs approved parts of the EU Withdrawal Bill related to devolution after less than 20 minutes of debate last week, despite the Scottish Parliament voting against granting formal consent for the Bill.  Under the Sewel Convention, Westminster does not normally legislate on devolved matters without Holyrood\u0027s approval.  First Minister Nicola Surgeon said the convention had been \"ripped up\", while Mr Russell told MSPs earlier this week that \"urgent discussions\" must now take place with Westminster over the issue.  Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland\u0027s Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Russell said: \"We are absolutely clear that the way that devolution operates and the structures of devolution have failed, and they failed because the UK Government is refusing to operate them.  \"For example, on the Sewel Convention, we need to have the interpretation of that written down in statute and made legally binding, because what we\u0027ve presently got is a situation where the UK Government makes the rules and then breaks them themselves, and there are no sanctions.\"  He said that, while there was \"practical work\" to do to prepare for Brexit, \"it is very difficult to do that work because, frankly, we don\u0027t trust the UK Government with it\".  Mr Russell added that he \"couldn\u0027t conceive of circumstances in which we brought legislative consent motions about Brexit issues to the chamber until we have resolved the issue of the Sewel Convention and the way the parliaments work together.

The struggling department store chain will close 31 out of its 59 outlets through a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), which will also allow it to secure rent reductions on its remaining shops.  Closures will affect up to 2,000 House of Fraser staff and a further 4,000 across brands and concessions.  House of Fraser secured the backing of more than 75% of creditors, including landlords, for the CVA at a meeting on Friday.  It was voted through despite anger among landlords, who have complained that they are being forced to stomach a financial hit at the same time as House of Fraser enjoys new investment.  Alongside the CVA, Hamleys owner C.banner is being lined up to buy a 51% stake in the firm and invest \u0026pound70 million into what remains of the business.  At the meeting, furious landlords berated House of Fraser\u0027s management and their advisers at KPMG over how the CVA was conducted.  They complained that their share of the vote had been structured unfairly in an attempt to push through the restructuring proposal.  Despite their protestations, a representative for two of House of Fraser\u0027s landlords said there had been \"no give\" from the top team.  House of Fraser boss Alex Williamson had warned that the store closures and job losses represented the \"last viable\" option to save the retailer, with the group at risk of collapse had the CVA been rejected.  Mr Williamson and chairman Frank Slevin were both in attendance at the creditor vote.  House of Fraser said the shops earmarked for closure, including its Oxford Street store, would remain open until early 2019.  The group also plans to relocate its Baker Street head office and the Granite House office in Glasgow to help slash costs and \"secure House of Fraser\u0027s future\".  A raft of CVAs have been struck in recent months as retailers struggle amid surging costs, rising business rates, competition from online rivals and a slowdown in consumer spending.  Other retailers undertaking CVAs in a bid to keep trading include New Look, Mothercare and Carpetright.  Restaurant businesses have also been seeking to cut their costs with store closure programmes, with Carluccio\u0027s, Byron and Prezzo all pushing through CVAs this year."},{"url":null,"title":"The Best Pictures From Around The World This Week - 22-06-2018","story":"                        The day in pictures:Sebastian Samy tries out at giant deck chair  ahead of the RHS Garden Harlow Car\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtr Flower Show in Har\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtrogate, Yorkshire which opens on Friday June 22nd until Sunday June 24th.

The Football Supporters\u0027 Federation (FSF) said \"disproportionate hype\" about the spectres of hooliganism and political tensions with Russia had stopped many from travelling.  Relations between the UK and Russian governments were plunged into a deep freeze following the poisoning in March of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal, while MPs raised concerns of a repeat of the violent attack in Marseille during Euro 2016.  England fans reported feeling outnumbered in Volgograd ahead of the 2-1 win against Tunisia on Monday, while there were around 4,000 empty seats in the stadium.  The group, which worked closely with the FA and the Foreign Office to prepare travel advice for fans, also cited the long distances, high costs and unlikely holiday feel to many host cities as factors for low numbers.  Many England fans have spent thousands travelling to watch the Three Lions, taking multiple indirect planes or train journeys that last up to 24 hours.  In a blog post, the FSF said there was a \"great\" disparity between the image portrayed in the media and the welcome fans had received in Volgograd.  \"The only sad thing about the whole experience is that the numbers of England fans who have been here to enjoy it have been so low: we reckon it\u0027s been probably the lowest number of England fans at a World Cup game for 30 years,\" the FSF said.  \"We know there are a lot of other reasons why a lot of people have chosen to support the team from back home - there\u0027s the distances, the cost of travel, the inescapable fact that Russia isn\u0027t really a traditional family holiday destination - but it\u0027s nonetheless a shame that some fans have been deterred from coming here because of disproportionate hype about the hooligan threat or political tensions.  \"The big majority of Russian people have been immensely friendly, generous and welcoming.  \"England fans above all should know from bitter experience the price that can be paid for judging everybody on the behaviour of a minority.\"  The FSF added that reports of hiked food and accommodation prices and an overbearing police and security presence had been \"unfounded\", with security forces \"visible but unobtrusive\".

Mr Blackford accused him of \u0026ldquocontrol freakery, treating folk with \u0026ldquoutter contempt, and \u0026ldquopolitical cowardice. Terms of affection he now reserves for the Tories.  MIND you, there was something distinctly Eck-esque in the way Mr Blackford cuffed away Moray MP Douglas Ross in Monday\u0026rsquos debate on the Sewel Convention. The youthful Tory, who is a part-time referee, asked about Holyrood having more powers after Brexit. Mr Blackford was unimpressed. \u0026ldquoTo use a football term, that was miles offside, son, he sniffed.  MR Blackford also gave an unlikely plug mid-peroration. \u0026ldquoThere is a wonderful book called \u0026lsquoThe Scottish Secretaries\u0026rsquo, he told MPs.

They were soon put straight on transparency matters. Meanwhile, at another FoI meeting this week, Mr Findlay was dramatically called out of the room. Red-faced, he later admitted - full disclosure - that he\u0027d accidentally pushed the panic button under his desk.

Labour\u0026rsquos shadow Scotland minister Paul Sweeney branded the proposals \u0026ldquoan absolute scandal, and called on SNP transport minister Humza Yousaf to intervene and guarantee that navigation on the canals will be maintained.  A Transport Scotland spokesman said it was in regular contact with canal bosses \u0026ldquoto discuss the opportunities and the challenges around maintaining these historic assets.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general.

However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Saturday 23 Jun 2018 6:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers. It’s a very busy few days for our producers, but always worth the effort and it also gives us an opportunity to tell the wider story about Orkney and all its other attractions.”Amongst the Orkney businesses travelling to the show will be newcomers, J. Gow Rum, makers of the county’s first locally produced rum.Collin van Schayk of rum producers, VS Distillers, said: “We’re very much looking forward to introducing J. Gow Rum to the visitors at this year’s Royal Highland Show. The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
