We hope this project inspires creativity and reflection, allowing the public create a unique time capsule for the future.”The final selection of images will be made up of 50 of the most “evocative, informative and inspiring” images submitted by the public and 50 works from the contemporary artists, which will be catalogued by the Historic England Archive and be available online.It is the first time the British public has been asked to contribute to the archive, which contains more than 12m photographs taken since 1939, when the social research organisation Mass Observation collected accounts of everyday life during wartime.These diaries are still held in archive storage and Mass Observation’s work has been praised for touching “the parts that other archives cannot reach” by drawing an anthropologist’s gaze on the British people.Founded in 1937, Mass Observation “sought to bridge the gap between how the media represented public opinion and what ordinary people actually felt and thought”, according to the historian Benjamin Jones.In 2013, the Photographers’ Gallery in London put on an exhibition of material selected from the Mass Observation archive, which the  critic Sean O’Hagan said showed the anthropologists to be “left-leaning and optimistic, but with a tendency to view the working-class as a kind of exotic species to be studied under an anthropological microscope”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/473ba083dffdb2e0c376bf9a9f40cf175acfb86c/576_660_4175_2506/master/4175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f613ff21ad41a6e0b678d685f1558976","title":"queens land the indigenous mayan queens of guatemala photo essay","story":"Hundreds of indigenous queens are elected each year in Guatemala. Photographer Julia Zabrodzka presents this little-known part of modern Mayan cultureby Bartlomiej Kaftan, photography by Julia ZabrodzkaAngelica Cardona, with a microphone in her hand, stands among a group of candidates. Her voice reverberates firmly from the stage: “The art of weaving forms part of our Mayan identity. Nowadays, however, cheap printed fabrics are replacing our ancestral hand-woven textiles. This is how capitalism is killing our culture and preventing us from putting our heart in each artisanal piece we produce.” Her last words sound like a cry of protest. Seems rather like a leftwing party’s rally than a beauty pageant, doesn’t it? Well, indigenous queen elections are not typical beauty contests.They may at first seem similar to Miss Universe events but differ from them in many ways. There are crowns awarded to the winners, but adorned with Maya glyphs and symbols rather than glitzy jewels. There are teenage candidates boasting their best dresses, but made of hand-woven cloth with patterns characteristic to their villages rather than silk or satin. And there is a jury, but its decision is based on the candidates’ knowledge of indigenous culture and the ability to give a powerful and meaningful speech rather than their physical beauty or measurements.Originally this was her only task. First contests were organised as early as in the 1920s and their winners were supposed to adorn a parade at a local festivity. Reinas indígenas, as they are called in Guatemala, still do that but their status has changed substantially. Nowadays they are regarded as ambassadors of their communities. They visit other towns during their elections and represent their own community’s attire and traditions. They often give speeches on subjects such as women’s rights or discrimination. And they are expected to work for their community – in many different ways.“Once I got invited to a neighbour’s family celebration. He asked me to give a speech to his daughters and cousins, encouraging them to stay at school and warning against teenage pregnancies,” recalls Lily Ixkotz’ij Saloj, 2017-2018 queen of the village of Chaquijyá and Sololá municipality. Odethy Tzep, 2017-2018 queen of Chuachinup, organised literacy classes for children and workshops for adult women on the subject of domestic violence, which affects many communities.Sara Elisabeth Mesia from Santiago Atitlán made recordings for a local TV station to raise awareness of growing pollution of the local lake, which is vital for its subsistence and tourism-based economy. And Marily López, queen of Huehuetenango department, is preparing a huge billboard to show the ethnic ersity of her region, where as many as nine indigenous languages are spoken. “Maya people still suffer from racist comments and attitudes here, especially in the capital of the department,” she admits. And that is something she hopes to change.The position of reinas indígenas is, however, not free of contradictions. They are expected to represent their communities, yet get hardly any support from local authorities. Most of them don’t receive a single quetzal to cover the expenses of travelling to other towns. They have to rely on their families’ support. Little wonder, then, that parents are sometimes reluctant when their daughters receive an invitation to take part in the election. “At first my mother was worried,” recalls Sara Elisabeth Mesia, who had to give up her job in a restaurant in order to be a queen. Working, studying and serving her community at the same time was simply too much to handle. “But now she is so proud of me. And keeps saying that we will handle that somehow.”Similar feelings prevail in most families. Being a queen may be a burden, but is also a once-in-a-lifetime experience. In conservative, patriarchal communities few young women get an opportunity to travel around the country or have their voice heard in public. This is something Matías Saloj – father of Lily Ixkotz’ij, 2017-2018 queen of Chaquijyá and Sololá municipality – is really proud of, even if his family had to make sacrificess. Matías says that they had to give up a part of their cornfield to accommodate all the guests of the fiesta at the end of Lily’s term. “We managed that”, he says firmly. “And my daughter could come up to the stage and claim with her head held high: Chaquijyá, mission accomplished!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48ba2578ef16731a2a2548ebcd2b323370b5e3ea/75_591_1247_747/master/1247.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a7a3a2cbd6a271ee55401bad9887c1f","title":"surrealist games for lockdown and a magritte masterpiece the week in art","story":"Tap into your unconscious with Tarot, check out feudal chess or gaze into Magritte’s magic mirror – all in your weekly dispatchSurrealist gamesThe surrealist movement started out by playing games in Parisian cafes.

But Camus’s The Plague had gone the way of dried pasta and toilet roll there was just a desolate gap on the shelves where the copies had once been.The primary lesson of plague literature, from Thucydides onwards, is how predictably humans respond to such crises. Over millennia, there has been a consistent pattern to behaviour during epidemics: the hoarding, the panicking, the fear, the blaming, the superstition, the selfishness, the surprising heroism, the fixation with the numbers of the reported dead, the boredom during quarantine.Defoe would have recognised the impulses behind the strange tableaux of life interrupted in central London: piles of ice melting outside abruptly closed bars a truck unloading gym equipment at an oligarch’s house in Mayfair jittery shoppers with overloaded trolleys. “Many families,” he writes, “foreseeing the approach of the distemper laid up stores of provisions sufficient for their whole families, and shut themselves up, and that so entirely, that they were neither seen or heard of till the infection was quite ceased.”The sudden, powerful need to know what’s coming is predictable, too. We turn to historical witnesses who can explain what it’s like. Defoe’s motive for writing A Journal of the Plague Year was an outbreak of bubonic plague in Marseille in 1720. Anticipating its spread, readers wanted to know what it had been like in 1665. Defoe, responding to demand, provided them with an instant book, fashioned out of statistics, reminiscences, gossip, anecdote and blood-curdling dramatic detail. “Passing through Token-House Yard in Lothbury, of a sudden a casement violently opened just over my head, and a woman gave three frightful screeches, and then cried, “O death, death, death!”Defoe almost certainly didn’t witness this – he would have been about five. Novelistic moments such as these would make the book compelling at any time, but right now it has a painful relevance. Defoe is particularly strong on the unpreparedness and prevarication that made the impact of the plague more severe. Or, as he puts it: “I often reflected upon the unprovided condition that the whole body of the people were in at the first coming of this calamity upon them and how it was for want of timely entering into measures and managements, as well public as private, that all the confusions that followed were brought upon us, and that such a prodigious number of people sunk in that disaster which, if proper steps had been taken, might, Providence concurring, have been avoided.”So much of the behaviour of our 17th-century forebears is uncomfortably familiar. The citizens of east London watch complacently as the plague tears through the West End, and assume they will be fine. They’re proved terrifyingly wrong. Defoe adds in a chilling parenthesis: “For indeed it came upon them like an armed man when it did come.”Even before germ theory, Defoe’s common sense and perceptiveness lead him to conclusions of which our chief medical officer would approve. He gives a prescient warning about the danger of asymptomatic carriers: “The plague is not to be avoided by those that converse promiscuously in a town infected, and people have it when they know it not, and that they likewise give it to others when they know not that they have it themselves.”If human behaviour remains dismayingly constant, one thing that has changed for the better is science and our understanding of it. Seven hundred years on, there’s something deeply poignant about Boccaccio’s pre-scientific description of the spread of the Black Death in his native Florence. “What was particularly virulent about this plague was that it would leap from the sick to the healthy whenever they were together, much as fire catches hold of dry or oily material that’s brought close to it. And that was not all. Not only did speaking with the sick and spending time with them infect the healthy or kill them off, but touching the clothes of the sick or handling anything they had touched seemed to pass on the infection.” You feel like the audience in a pantomime, wanting to shout across the centuries and tell him who the villain is and how he operates.Not everyone responds to plague by immersing themselves in data about epidemics. The escapist response to disaster is another predictable move and The Decameron epitomises it. After his short but terrifying description of the Florentine plague, Boccaccio sends his troupe of young characters into quarantine, where they spend the remainder of the book, swapping funny, ribald stories: the plague doesn’t feature again. It’s a welcome relief to lose yourself in a world of cuckolds and randy nuns. And once more, plus ça change. The gilded Florentine youths are doing the 14th-century equivalent of binge-watching Sex Education on Netflix.Thomas Mann and Camus are less interested in plague itself than in using it to make existential points. The plague in Death in Venice is an avatar of death in general, the terrible mystery, the pale horse it is something that strips away vanity and reveals unpalatable truths. In Mann’s novella, it is the catalyst for Von Aschenbach’s humiliating descent into clownish self-destruction. At the same time, the pages dealing with the cholera epidemic are vigorous and apposite. The hotels in Venice empty swiftly, despite official protestations that there is nothing to worry about. It’s a young English travel agent who finally cuts through the official flannel. The doubts he raises about administrative competence and probity are ones that in due course we’ll all be obliged to consider. “‘That is,’ he continued in an undertone and with some feeling, ‘the official explanation, which the authorities here have seen fit to stick to.’”Camus is the real odd one out. The Plague is often read as an allegory of the French experience under occupation, but right now there seems nothing allegorical about it: the hero, Dr Rieux, seems like a naturalistic depiction of a frontline care-worker forced into impossible decisions over who gets a ventilator. At other historical moments, the constant reflection on the meaning of the plague could seem heavy-handed – Gallic, not in a good way – but in 2020 it’s like reading The Crucible while your elderly parent is on trial for witchcraft. For long stretches, you forget any notion of allegory and simply wonder how Camus could have got it so right: from the panic buying of peppermints that people think will be a prophylactic, to the high mortality rate in the municipal jail, to the exhausted healthcare workers, and the terrible monotony of quarantine, something with which we are only just beginning to get acquainted.And then, of course, the plague ends. That’s the actual good news that these books bring. The epidemic always passes. The majority of people survive. Thucydides himself had it and recovered. “I shall simply tell it as it happened,” he promises of the plague that ravaged fifth-century Athens, “and describe the features of the disease which will give anyone who studies them some prior knowledge to enable recognition should it ever strike again.”Should it ever strike again is the phrase that awakens our sense of hubris. For all the talk of an unprecedented crisis, we are living through something with many precedents. “There was particularly high mortality among doctors because of their particular exposure,” Thucydides wrote 2,500 years ago in a sentence that could appear in tomorrow’s paper. We have assumed that deadly epidemics belonged to a phase of history that was behind us, as quaint and irrelevant as candlelight and milking your own cows.When the number of fatalities finally peaks and dwindles, Defoe’s citizens pull up their windows and shout to each other to share the news. Camus’s Oran is liberated its citizens struggle to make sense of what has happened to them. Back in fifth-century Athens, the Peloponnesian war continues. Whether society changes for the better or worse, or simply stays the same, is what we will find out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0963850d6b84d4810407c023e5c780972d698867/0_98_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=288e0769b7cc320cb76bbadec5ccdce0","title":"lakeside and trafford centre owner to get tough with big name shops","story":"Intu Properties to take on ‘well-capitalised large brands who have chosen not to pay rents’ during Covid-19 crisisIntu Properties has said it is ready to take “robust action” against large tenants who have failed to pay rent owed during the coronavirus crisis.Thousands of high street jobs have been lost in the last 12 months as a result of high profile retail administrations, and thousands more are at risk as Mothercare, Debenhams and Forever 21 prepare for closures.

But more than 100 jobs lost with the closure of 15 stores.Patisserie Valerie: Had 200 cafes employing nearly 3,000 people when an accounting scandal prompted the chain to call in administrators in January 2019. About 70 of the group’s 200 stores closed immediately with the loss of 900 jobs. About 2,000 jobs were saved when about 100 Patisserie Valerie cafes were rescued by Causeway Capital, more than 20 of which have since closed. 21 Philpotts sandwich shops were bought by AF Blakemore \u0026amp Son. and four Baker \u0026amp Spice cafes a were bought by the Department of Coffee \u0026amp Social Affairs.Sarah ButlerIntu said: “There are a very small number of cases where customers are not currently engaging with us to find a consensual solution – these are large, well-capitalised brands who have the ability to pay but have chosen not to. In these instances we are prepared to take more robust action to enforce the legally binding terms of those leases.”The company said it would consider legal action including sending statutory demands, a formal request for payment or winding-up petitions – a legal notice usually sent by a creditor to request that the courts close a company that owes it money – to the one or two tenants who were refusing to pay.The government has banned commercial property landlords from taking legal action against tenants who have not paid their rent until 30 June, to protect retailers and other businesses during the coronavirus crisis.However, the government has asked high-street retailers and other companies to “pay what they can” to their landlords, and Intu believes a couple of retailers are taking advantage of this situation. The shopping centre owner is offering monthly rather than quarterly rent payments until the end of the year and has reduced its service charges, and it said it was negotiating rent payment plans with some tenants.The indebted company also used the update to investors to announce it had agreed waivers with some of its lenders to prevent potential breaches as it struggles with plummeting rental income. Intu warned in late March it would breach the terms on its debt commitments after a collapse in retail rents.Colm Lauder, a property analyst at the investment bank Goodbody, said the debt waivers would give Intu some breathing space. “While the waivers don’t give Intu much flexibility – lasting until June – they only pose weekly battles for the firm rather posing a long-term hurdle. This also signals a good likelihood that other retail landlords will benefit from covenants waivers,” he said. ﻿The company has appointed a chief restructuring officer to help as it “works through its strategy to fix the balance sheet”. David Hargrave was previously a partner in the restructuring practices of the big-four accountancy firms PwC and EY.Even before the coronavirus crisis began, the company had been hit by a spate of retailers closing stores and restructuring, and had been forced to write down the value of its centres by nearly £2bn.The company cancelled its emergency cash call at the start of March because of “extreme” market conditions as Covid-19 spread around the world. It had aimed to raise at least £1.3bn from investors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d1eec7307019b6f25e27c9e0b914da9222f928c/139_66_3122_1873/master/3122.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e06f426a3f22830fc1c077d3aa7b700","title":"stock markets ftse 100 wall street amazon apple rbs ryanair coronavirus covid 19 sterling manufacturing business live","story":" Rolling live coverage of business, economics and financial markets Even as world leaders gradually consider easing the lockdowns imposed on major economies, the economic consequences of the pandemic are barely started.

JJThe woes of the US manufacturing sector were laid bare by a PMI reading that was the worst since 2009, as employment prospects in the sector were decimated. The April purchasing managers’ index (PMI) reading was 41.5, down 7.6 points from the March reading of 49.1, according to the US Institute of Supply Management.Economists had expected a reading of 35, far below the 50 mark that denotes expanding output in the sector.IHS Markit’s separate US manufacturing PMI hit 36.1 in April, down from 48.5 in March and the previously released “flash” figure of 36.9. That was the lowest for just over eleven years as well.Binay Chandgothia, portfolio manager at Principal Global Investors, said:A 12.4-point drop in the U.S. PMI is an absolute outlier for a single month. Even during the global financial crisis, it dropped by a max of 5.9 points from September 2008 (44.8) to October 2008 (38.9). However, we’ve seen similar data across global markets over the last few weeks, so there is little shock value in today’s numbers.The markets have already moved beyond analysing the anticipated immediate collapse in economic activity to focusing on the duration of it. While there are some initial signs of stabilisation in indicators that have already dropped precipitously, the markets would like to see continued progress – moving from a stabilisation phase to a recovery phase. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said:April saw the manufacturing sector struck hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with output falling to an extent surpassing that seen even at the height of the global financial crisis.With orders collapsing at a rate not seen for over a decade, supply chains disrupted to a record degree and pessimism about the outlook hitting a new survey high, rising numbers of firms are culling payroll numbers. One for the committed central bank watchers among our readers: Tiff Macklem is the new governor of the Bank of Canada (Mark Carney’s alma mater). Wall Street has followed the lead of London and fallen, after disappointing corporate earnings and Donald Trump’s threat to put tariffs on China in retaliation for its role in the crisis.White House adviser Larry Kudlow has been speaking on US television, indicating that the US government is concerned about a lack of transparency from China.There is no rush to put in place new tariffs, he said, and he added that full faith in US debt is sacrosanct - addressing speculation the US government could unilaterally write off China’s massive Treasury debt holdings.Cuts of that scale at the Irish flagcarrier would be roughly in line with British Airways, which plans to make 12,000 redudancies, about a quarter of its workers. Reuters reported the plans, citing a source close to the talks. Aer Lingus, part of International Airlines Group (IAG), which also owns British Airways, declined to comment, saying it was “continuing to communicate directly with our employees and engage with their representative bodies.”International Airlines Group, BA and Aer Lingus’s owner, has gained state aid for its Spanish airlines, Iberia and Vueling.The crisis has proved to be something of a reckoning for the oil industry, and ExxonMobil in particular.The company is facing increasing investor pressure to act on the climate crisis, with the Church of England’s investment fund targeting Exxon’s board over their lack of movement to tackle the biggest issue of the time.At the same time, ExxonMobil pretty much missed the shale boom in its own back yard, and debt-fuelled expansion has left it vulnerable. In a symbol of the times, Netflix, last month overtook Exxon by market capitalisation.Here are WTI futures prices this year, down from above $60:ExxonMobil, the US supermajor oil producer, took a $3bn charge in the first quarter as the coronavirus outbreak pushed it to a $610m loss - its first loss in decades.Oil producers have been plunged into chaos as the pandemic has drastically reduced demand for energy.US oil prices have even turned briefly negative, in an indication of the strains on the industry.In the first three months of 2020 Exxon’s oil drilling made only $536m, compared to $2.9bn the year before.It is a sign of the strange times that investors around the world are closely following the progress of drug development. The ups and downs of the testing process for remdesivir have caused billions of pounds of money to shift around the world as people hope for an effective antiviral treatment.On Friday its chief executive said he expected the US Food and Drug Administration to act quickly over the company’s application for approval.Gilead would try to get the drug to as many people as possible if it was approved, he said.“We’re moving very quickly with the FDA,” Daniel O’Day said in an interview with NBC’s Today show, via Reuters. “And I expect that they’re going to act very quickly.”Sterling has slipped to a one-week low against the euro, with analysts blaming Brexit back-and-forth and a general aversion to riskier assets (as evidenced by the stock market selloff).And remember, with many investors in Europe on holiday (even if confined to their homes) it is likely that trading is thinner than normal.Reuters’ summary of the latest Brexit shenanigans said:A source close to Britain’s negotiating team said the country was confident it can get a deal on future ties with the European Union if Brussels started treating it as an independent negotiator.But, underlining what sources in Brussels say is an impasse at talks since Britain left the EU in January, French officials later reiterated the 27-nation bloc’s position that London must make concessions for a deal to be reached this year.The two sides have been unable to find any compromise on three main areas - the so-called level playing field guarantees of fair competition, governance and fisheries policy, according to the sources in Brussels and London.Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, a trading platform, said the pound was hit because it is seen as less of a safe haven given the added political risk. He said: The main driver for sterling’s weakness is the change in market sentiment to a more sombre mood, and this won’t support currencies that are more closely linked to risk. Heathrow airport has warned that it may soon follow British Airways in announcing mass redundancies unless the government restores confidence by planning for how flying could restart.The chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said physical distancing measures could not work in airports and common international standards for health controls were needed, such as temperature screening at the entrance to airports and the wearing of face masks throughout the process to ensure a low risk of transmission.An interesting side note to Royal Bank of Scotland’s results this morning: as well as a big impairment for bad debts related to the crisis, it is closing its effort to create a digital-first lender to rival the likes of Monzo, Revolut and Starling.That project, named (fairly inexplicably) as Bó, appears to have failed - although RBS said it was just deciding to roll the technology and the brand under its Mettle brand for lending to small businesses.You can read the full report on the RBS results here:The unions have had some time to swallow the bitter pill that is Ryanair’s decision to cut as many as 3,000 jobs. Unite will argue that the decision should be reversed.Referring also to British Airways’ decision to cut 12,000 jobs, Unite national officer for aviation Oliver Richardson said:This is another premature announcement, especially while the government’s job retention scheme remains fully up and running.Ryanair has significant cash reserves and is in a better place than many airlines to cope with the challenges that the Covid-19 pandemic has created.The union also called for the government to intervene with aid for the sector, despite concerns over its environmental impact.Most of Europe may be on holiday today, but for investors in the UK and US May day is not looking very relaxing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/884fea00ddf1e7ed6b7390f16fef87ee2d124dc3/0_7_2758_1653/master/2758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae492019a45035ecc79694140cf8c56d","title":"cavalier tory leader botched pandemic response 1957","story":"Then, as now, a government responsible for a disaster tried to change the narrative. We shouldn’t let history repeat itselfHarold Macmillan was British prime minister from 1957 to 1963. A charming Tory with a patchy record, he’s usually remembered for saying that during his government Britons had “never had it so good” in their standard of living. What has been forgotten, almost completely, is that he said this in the middle of a pandemic.Macmillan made his claim on 20 July 1957, at a party rally in Bedford. Like Boris Johnson, he was a new premier with a preference for optimistic public statements. In 1957, the British economy was actually quite fragile, and Macmillan acknowledged this in his speech, but the idea that Tory rule kept Britain prosperous and safe was central to his premiership. As now, the party had already been in power for years, and needed to present a Labour government as a terrible risk.The pandemic, of a new strain of flu, had started in China the previous winter. During the first half of 1957 it steadily moved across Asia and then the rest of the world, killing hundreds of thousands of people, to the alarm of the world’s media, including the British press. In June, the first cases appeared in Britain. Yet that month, and again in July, Macmillan’s health secretary, Dennis Vosper, refused to make a public statement setting out the threat the flu posed, arguing that it was not spreading in the UK.The government advised those with symptoms to stay at home, but otherwise took little national action as the flu spread right across the country during the autumn, instead leaving it to local medical officials to work out what to do. In some areas, schools were closed, but few sporting events or other mass gatherings were cancelled. In October, the peak of the outbreak in Britain, the Conservative party conference went ahead as usual. Macmillan’s speech didn’t mention the pandemic.Many critics of Johnson over coronavirus are hoping for a similar reckoning. The government is expecting one, too, judging by its goalpost-shifting rhetoric, such as the prime minister’s highly selective boast this week that Britain had “defied so many predictions” about the impact of the virus.But for Johnson’s critics, the fate of Macmillan’s government in the aftermath of the 1957 pandemic is not a reassuring precedent. During the later months of the crisis – not a point the government has reached yet – the Tories’ poll ratings did fall sharply. But by the time the next general election came, in 1959, the pandemic had receded. The Labour manifesto didn’t even raise the government’s handling of it. The Conservatives talked up their economic record instead, and won easily, increasing their Commons majority to 100.In Britain, it remains disconcertingly easy – and a sign of how lopsided our democracy is – for Tory governments responsible for disasters to change the subject. The rightwing bias of the press, worse now than in the 1950s, as there are fewer left-leaning papers, is the obvious villain. But equally important is a reluctance from voters to face up to the sheer scale of what the Conservatives have sometimes got wrong.The 1957 flu catastrophe came the year after the disastrous British military intervention at Suez – also under the Conservatives, and supported by Macmillan – which destroyed much of Britain’s credibility as a world power. Similarly, the British coronavirus failure closely follows the Tories’ chaotic Brexit U-turns and hugely counterproductive austerity. Yet in both eras, many voters have avoided coming to the unsettling conclusion that, quite often, their default ruling class simply isn’t up to the job. It’s more comforting to believe, as Johnson promised this week, that after its latest calamity, “the UK will emerge stronger than ever before”.Our national myth often revolves around recovery from disaster. In this narrative, failures by the state – such as the second world war setbacks that led to Dunkirk – just create opportunities for future, greater successes. As a politician preoccupied by history, and not very good at governing, Johnson understands this well. His much-admired optimism is really a form of cynicism: as he blunders through the present, he keeps the possibility of better times for Britain in the future floating perpetually in the distance, like a mirage.Can the Tories’ cynical optimism and evasions of responsibility ever be effectively pointed out? They can if Labour has a sharp enough leader. In 1957, Macmillan was mocked in parliament for his “never had it so good” speech by the shadow chancellor. With deft sarcasm, Harold Wilson called the speech “remarkable”. Wilson became Labour leader in 1963, as Macmillan’s supposed economic miracle finally petered out, and won four of the next five elections. Keir Starmer might do well to get some old tapes of him out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c43dfb32afb2e48bd468ae0d2f388b775b534e1a/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cea8ae754dff61a6345117955c47d5f4","title":"young people jobless future labour employment schemes","story":"The government needs to ape Labour’s successful post-crash employment schemes and use what works to avert this crisisThis summer, new cohorts of young people will tumble out of their closed-down schools and colleges into a shut-down world of no work. Some half a million will be leaving university, as many more may be leaving school or ending training and further education to emerge into nothingness. If they have lost their entire summer term, they will have had precious little careers advice, most of which was an early victim of austerity cuts anyway. The wealth of research from previous recessions shows that a long spell of early unemployment risks people being scarred for life.Here’s a shocking fact hidden by the steep fall in unemployment figures in recent years: there were always at least 800,000 unemployed under-25s adrift – not in education, employment or training (Neets). Many have physical disabilities, illnesses and mental health problems that have been ignored. Many are part of that long tail of lost youth from addicted or violent families they are care leavers, people with no qualifications pulled into gangs and drugs, and failed by schools and underfunded social services that are unable to pick them up in time. As one employment expert said, “These were the ones we didn’t fix when the sun shone.” Instead of help, they were chased away from claiming benefits by Iain Duncan Smith’s exceptionally punitive Jobcentre-sanctioning regimes demanding they sign in every day.This week the alarm was raised by the Youth Employment Group, a new consortium including the Institute for Employment Studies (IES), the Prince’s Trust and others determined to prevent another lost generation of long-term unemployed people. Tony Wilson, director of the IES, and a former senior DWP researcher, has been watching the weekly vanishing of vacancies in horror: “They are the lowest ever, three times worse than ever before and each week it gets worse.” All sorts of jobs have gone, he says – in accountancy, finance and IT, along with the rest. In a recession, “what kills is not people losing jobs, but the lack of anyone hiring,” says Wilson.It will take a phenomenal government effort to fire up good work programmes. Already Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has talked this week of winding down the government’s furlough scheme. But what happens next to all the millions of employees who will be cast off? Young people are always at the back of the queue.Ministers have no memory: they deliberately forget anything some other government did. They prefer to reinvent wheels, marking their own thumbprint on schemes, regardless of voluminous evidence on what works. But this time, if they want to prevent unemployment armageddon, they should look back to what Labour did, both with 1997’s new deal for young people and its post-2008 crash rescue programmes. What worked was job guarantees and high-quality training, experienced advisers and subsidies to employers to hire those who were unemployed.One of the most successful was the post-crash Future Jobs Fund, a generous-spirited and popular plan. I followed its progress in detail, interviewing its beneficiaries and employers who took people on. After six months’ intensive help to find work with a personal adviser, people were offered expensive training in almost anything. If still out of work after nine months, any employer taking them on was given a subsidy of £6,500. There were strict conditions, drawn up with the CBI and TUC: no job substitution, no displacing other workers, but the creation of an extra job doing something of benefit to the community. All these Labour-era work programmes were intensively researched.The Future Jobs Fund ran for little more than a year before the Tories turned it into a 2010 election weapon. David Cameron abolished it with a flourish he said it was “expensive, badly targeted and did not work”, an example of Labour over-spending. Not so. Instead his action was an example of his government’s taste for policy-based evidence-making – pick your political policy first and invent the evidence later. Cameron didn’t bother to wait for actual results. The academic evidence supporting the programme – which involved following up all cases and control groups, tracing what became of recipients – emerged a year too late. But it showed this had been an unprecedented success that produced a net gain to the UK: compared with control groups “it had raised the number of unemployed who went into permanent work by a quarter – a phenomenal success”, says Wilson. It saved £7,750 for each participant in extra tax receipts and reduced benefit bills. There is plentiful research on other schemes, too: the successful German Kurzarbeit (“short-time work”) scheme offers a way to turn furloughing into a part-time work subsidy. Look back, too, at Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal for how governments can invest to employ: there was no lack of urgent public works after a decade of neglect. But above all learn from the best of Labour’s programmes. Rebrand them as Boris bonuses or whatever, deny their Labour origins, but use the high-grade evidence for what works to help save another generation from the lifelong damage of extensive unemployment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/398f7cba9c7748958910b9caa8884c17d444e7ff/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d0d67e5da8c09fc28856f42ae72840d","title":"university students have you stayed or returned to your term time address","story":"We’d like to hear from students who are returning to their university address for the start of third term, or who have remained there during lockdownAs universities prepare to enter their third term of remote teaching, some students are planning to return to their term-time home.

Roach said he was concerned, however, that ministers were coming under pressure from Conservative backbenchers and others to speed up the reopening of schools, which would allow parents back to work to help kickstart the economy.“We are asking ministers to resist that pressure and focus on the public health issues,” said Roach. “But that pressure may prove to be irresistible and ministers might move sooner rather than later to reopen schools in some form.“I’m sure there’s a desire to see schools open this side of the summer break. From my point of view, what’s critically important is that such decisions are taken on the basis of public health concerns, ensuring the health and safety of our members and pupils.”Roach said it was still unclear how social distancing might work in schools, or whether personal protective equipment (PPE) would be available for staff who need it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c956d252b4992db76c484aa3bb6198a51195e719/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15861578b0366510ec618d58b46e289d","title":"indian students trapped in uk by coronavirus actually starving","story":"Emergency food drops for thousands of young people unable to work or fly home Thousands of Indian students unable to leave the UK because of the coronavirus lockdown are relying on food donations from charities because they can no longer afford to eat.Student groups representing the students, from across the UK, have been coordinating emergency food drops with local community groups and charities. Many of the young people have lost their part-time jobs and can no longer afford even basic living costs.The Indian National Students’ Association, one of the largest student groups, says so far it has helped to distribute food to more than 3,000 struggling students across the country. A second UK-wide students’ group, the National Indian Students and Alumni Union, says it has also had calls from hundreds of students who cannot afford food. Charan Sekhon, chair of an Anglo-Indian charity based in Bedford called the Seva Trust, which has delivered food parcels to more than 60 Indian students in its local area, says: “We have had lots of examples where students are actually starving. They haven’t got anything at all to eat.”Virendra Sharma, Labour MP for Ealing Southall, wrote to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, on Wednesday calling for universities to ringfence money from hardship funds, which are often discretionary, for international students. He also called for minimum service standards for universities to ensure they are offering students enough advice and support.He wrote: “I have heard stories of international students contemplating suicide because they do not know what to do and cannot afford to eat.”India banned all international flights from 22 March, giving students only two days to arrange to get home. Flights that typically cost around £300 were selling for £2,000, and thousands of students found themselves stranded in Britain.India is the fastest growing market for British universities, with nearly 27,000 Indian students coming to the UK in 2018-19. International students can pay up to £38,000 a year in tuition fees to study for an undergraduate degree at a UK university. Indian student groups and charities say many Indian students are not from wealthy families, and have to rely on part-time jobs to cover their living expenses.Sekhon says his small charity, which usually focuses on education projects, has been flooded with queries from students since being listed by the Indian high commission as a coronavirus support group. It has been delivering free hot meals and food to Indian students in Milton Keynes, Bedford and Luton for the past four weeks. He says the students are mainly from the universities of Cranfield, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire.“I don’t think universities fully understand what is going on,” he says. “Many of these students have been doing cash-in-hand or hourly-paid jobs, which they have lost. They can’t get home to their families, and they feel alone and don’t know how to access help like food banks.”A spokesperson for the University of Bedfordshire says: “Students don’t always highlight their difficulties and don’t contact our support team. We would urge students who are struggling to get in contact straight away.” The university can provide care packages and financial support as well as help finding work, she says.Cranfield University says it is aware of only one case of hardship. “Our student support and wellbeing team is looking into the details and will offer help,” it says.The University of Hertfordshire says is it offering wellbeing support, care packages, accommodation and food vouchers and has set up a new fund to help students in hardship as a result of the pandemic. Sameer Dhore, a student at the University of Greenwich and president of the university’s Indian Society, says: “Students are crying on the phone saying they want to see their mum or dad. The major issue is finance. Students are running out of money right now. There are students with nothing to live on.”The National Indian Students and Alumni Union says it has received thousands of queries from anxious students “trapped” across the UK, hundreds of whom say they do not have enough to eat.Sanam Arora, NISAU’s chairwoman, says: “A lot of students rely on part-time jobs, and now they have lost them they can’t pay their rent or buy food.” She says there is an atmosphere of panic: “The mental health issues are just flabbergasting. Some students have even threatened suicide.”The organisation has called on the Indian government to help get students home, and is backing a call by the UK’s National Union of Students for the UK government to do more to help. “International students are falling through the safety net,” she warns.Prerit Souda, an INSA committee member, says that as well as being unable to buy food, some students have been facing eviction because they cannot pay their rent. “We connect them with legal experts, but in some scenarios students have been sub-contracting and that is much more difficult as they don’t have the same rights. In those cases we have been working with Indian community organisations to find them somewhere free to stay.”The Indian government has said the flights ban will continue until midnight on Sunday. Student groups, charities and parents are calling for students to be put to the front of the queue for repatriation.Universities UK, the vice-chancellors’ group, says all universities now have support systems in place. Vivienne Stern, UUK’s international director, says: “The first piece of advice we would give students is please, please contact your university. If they don’t know, they can’t help you. They might not be able to fix everything, but there are people on hand who want to help and listen to your problems.”Stern says some universities are going the extra mile to reach out to students, rather than waiting for students to come to them. These include Exeter University, which has been calling all remaining international students daily. Meanwhile, Bath University has moved students who were in halls in the city centre into rooms on its campus, and is providing three free meals a day.Meanwhile, parents and relatives back in India have been using social media to beg the Indian government to bring their children home. They include Dipti Taluja, whose 18-year-old son is doing a degree in sound engineering and music production at a private higher education institution in London. “It is very scary sitting thousands of miles away and knowing you are helpless and cannot do anything to bring back your child,” she says from her home in Gurugram, near New Delhi. Her son has been “very depressed”, she says, but is coping better after speaking to volunteers at NISAU.The UK Council for International Student Affairs has an advice page to help students."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10e006460b9b30e3ea913fe78ee584f3fb6a2a53/0_151_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=594479e482dd83ae5f0938a0fef1bc3d","title":"cant hurry love slow worms embrace marathon sessions of lockdown loving aoe","story":"If you’re gardening more than usual, try not to disturb the legless lizard, which can mate for up to 10 hours at a time in May Under a small, sun-baked mat, a curled metallic-gold slow worm lies basking in the heat, the dark stripe running down its body revealing its youth. Sensing attention, it begins to wriggle away, revealing a companion, which speeds rapidly into the grasses in the opposite direction.After a winter of social distancing, slow worms – a type of legless lizard that grows up to half a metre long and is often mistaken for a snake – have been venturing out of hibernation to enjoy warming their cold-blooded bodies in the spring sun.Picnics may be out for now, but an assortment of rugs and mats placed around Sutton Ecology Centre, a secluded two-hectare nature reserve tucked away behind a main road in Carshalton, south London, are playing host to a more subterranean kind of socialising.The amorous slow worms, which come in an array of polished silvers, golds and browns depending on age and gender, mate for up to 10 hours at a time in May there’s a good chance that peeling back the corner of one of the mats in the centre during peak season will reveal two entwined.“It is always a treat to find one,” says Barbara O’Keeffe, a retired local resident who has volunteered at the site for eight years. “When you gently pull back one of the mats to look, for a second you think there’s nothing there, then there’s a glint of gold.”This week, the \u0027s Age of Extinction site is looking at bioersity in cities and urban areas around the world, shining a spotlight on the under-appreciated world of nature hidden among the highrises and busy roads.The Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.In this special series of reports we\u0027ll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.Though they are rarely seen out in the open, slow worms are common throughout the UK. But the ecology centre – which packs in woodlands, wildflower meadows, and a pond currently teeming with tadpoles and wildfowl chicks – is a hotspot.“It is positioned at the point where the chalky North Downs meets London clay, in an area fed by one of only about 200 chalk streams in the world,” says David Warburton, senior bioersity officer for the London Borough of Sutton, which owns the centre. “The site is ideal for reptiles such as slow worms. We have a really healthy population of them, but they are isolated by surrounding roads and housing.”The reptiles – which live for up to 30 years (the oldest on record was a captive 54-year-old male in Copenhagen zoo) – feast on slugs, snails and insects. In turn they provide food for various birds, as well as badgers and hedgehogs – numbers of which have declined dramatically in the past two decades.Like all six of the UK’s reptile species, slow worms are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, making it illegal to intentionally kill, injure or sell them. But this doesn’t stop them regularly falling victim to carelessly wielded shovels, a risk that could increase as lockdown increases the amount of time people spend in their gardens during the slow worm mating season.“Just be mindful that they’re around,” says Warburton. “They are not at all dangerous. If you find one, be careful not to spook it, or it could shed its tail – which is their main defence mechanism. But by all means get close and marvel at how great they are, look at their eyelids, ear holes, forked tongue, and then leave them where you found them.” Leaving out covers such as old rugs or corrugated iron in a sunny spot can encourage them into the garden, he says.O’Keeffe recommends a bit of messiness in the garden to create a more holistic ecosystem: not mowing areas of lawn, leaving piles of logs and leaves, and ensuring gaps under fences to allow hedgehogs and other animals in and out.“We often have a stall at local events and I remember one lady being delighted, saying ‘Oh, I’ve been feeling guilty about the wild patch at the bottom of my garden … now I’m going to call it my wildlife area.’”In normal times the ecology centre welcomes 7,000 schoolchildren a year. The species that call the wildlife centre home, not least the population of slow worms, are a big draw. “Lots of kids haven’t got any frame of reference for things … snails, worms, everything’s ‘icky’,” says Warburton.The loss of half of the world’s wildlife is at the forefront of the centre’s work. “I don’t think that most people have cottoned onto the fact that there is a bioersity crisis,” says Warburton. “We teach the kiddies so that they care and will do something about it. Activities like building a stick den, picking up a snail – it helps them to not be scared to get their hands dirty. We try to turn their fear into fascination.”An understanding of natural processes isn’t always better among local adults, according to Warburton, especially in urban areas. He describes the reaction of the public when his team introduced native cattle to the Roundshaw Downs in 2012, a rare chalk grassland three miles south-east, on the site of London’s first international airport in Croydon. They used castrated male Sussex cattle, which are naturally hornless and very placid. “Well, you’d think we’d released lions. Some people were apoplectic. I had to say: ‘This is not Jurassic Park we are creating!’”He wonders if the current crisis might bring about a shift in people’s interest in their local wildlife, including the mysterious slow worm. “Hopefully they might realise you don’t have to go to a national park to see cool and interesting species. Once you’ve seen them in your garden, the whole world opens up.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/417bac1d0ba6108dac4f12fee83b6a719a5f133b/0_166_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9d8ea58291c7fcdec26a6d7d14f22fd0","title":"led lights halve unwanted fish in nets research finds","story":"Study shows lit escape holes allow non-target species to get away, protecting populationsA simple technique to “illuminate the exits” in trawl fishing nets can almost halve the numbers of unwanted catch, new research has found, potentially protecting both the environment and fishermen’s livelihoods.Attaching LED lights to larger holes in nets, intended to allow non-target species to escape, dramatically reduced the numbers killed unnecessarily, a team from Bangor University found.The research, published in Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, inverts an old fishing technique of shining a light on water to attract fish into a net.The study, conducted between June and August 2017, tested the effect of lights in reducing the number of haddock and flatfish caught in a queen scallop fishery off the Isle of Man.Bycatch is a problem in fisheries worldwide because it inflicts further damage on often depleted non-target species, and kills mammals and seabirds that become entangled in nets.It can also be a huge cost to fishermen - under EU law, fishermen are required to bring ashore almost everything they catch, including fish that are not part of their quota.If they end up catching too much of their non-target species, their fishery can be “choked” – closed for months – to allow vulnerable stocks to recover.Lucy Southworth, lead author of the study, said: “Traditionally, and this goes back decades and maybe even centuries, fishers used lights to attract fish.“We are turning that on its head to try and manipulate the behavioural responses in fish and other animals, to either repel them away from gear, or to manipulate their behaviour so they can escape from the net.”She added: “We decided to attach the lights to the escape exit to try and guide fish towards it so they would escape more so than if the lights weren’t there.”Southworth said the discovery that existing bycatch reduction devices without LEDs stop working at greater depths, and at night, was “very worrying”.It meant fishermen trying to comply with the rules still risked their fisheries being closed early, and also causing unintended environmental damage.The research team believes the LED solution could prove popular because the lights are relatively cheap, and easily applied to existing nets and reconfigured for different environments.Separate research, conducted in Peru, has shown LED lights can reduce the numbers of seabirds entangled in gill nets, and is trying to establish if they can help protect turtles.Anecdotally, the team on the Isle of Man found evidence of sharks escaping nets, and thought it could be an area for further research. The LED solution could potentially reduce the numbers of dolphins, whales and porpoises unintentionally killed, with the lights ﻿alerting the mammals to the presence of nets – particularly gill netting, which forms a wall across the seabed – helping them to avoid danger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36cb97d6d939267b509f3c77edb29677440be482/0_270_3335_2001/master/3335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c59a9a311ecd2478c5ee58aca85e763","title":"no one comes the cruise ship crews cast adrift by coronavirus","story":" From the Galapagos to Dubai crew have been left marooned amid squabbles over who is responsible for their welfareThe Apex was nearly finished. A brand new cruise ship for the Celebrity Cruises line, it was a towering, 117,000-ton vessel with luxuries like a “resort deck” featuring martini-glass-shaped jacuzzis and a movable platform cantilevered off the side – known as “the Magic Carpet” – to be used as an outdoor restaurant. As the builders put the finishing touches to it, the company held parties for crew and contractors, even as the rest of the world was shutting down to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Alexandra Nedeltcheva was one of the waiters. Though she avoided the parties, she served the contractors and crew at one of the ship’s restaurants. She says she contracted Covid-19 before the Apex even left port.“It’s really scary, you don’t know how long it’s going to last,” says a coughing Nedeltcheva. She says she had trouble getting anyone to respond to her calls for medicine and help. “When I called medical and said, ‘can you get me some medicine, my head is going to explode’, they said, ‘there are people sicker than you, stay where you are’.”She is one of more than 100 Celebrity Cruises crew members who have joined a class-action suit filed against the company on 14 April, alleging it failed to take timely action to protect workers, despite having weeks of notice that coronavirus was spreading worldwide.The ship is not an exception. Across the world, a  investigation has uncovered at least 50 ships facing outbreaks of Covid-19 among the crew.Nedeltcheva, who managed to catch a charter flight to her home city in Bulgaria, may have been one of the lucky ones.Upwards of 100,000 other crew members – including hundreds of her colleagues aboard the Apex – remain trapped on their ships.Most have no communication with the outside world, and the ones who do are often scared of losing any prospect of future work by complaining. In the course of the ’s investigation, however, a portrait has begun to emerge of what is effectively a nation of floating castaways, marooned on boats from the Galapagos Islands to the port of Dubai.The first cruise ship to face Covid-19 cases, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined at dock in Japan for two weeks starting on 3 February. But cruises kept departing until mid-March. Although most passengers have since been repatriated, Covid-19 outbreaks continue to spread among the crew stuck on the ships. Last week employees aboard the Queen Victoria, which had just pulled into Southampton, were told they would have to quarantine in their cabins for 14 days because Covid-19 cases had been confirmed aboard, according to a recording of the captain’s announcement obtained by Business Insider.In the US the situation was so grim aboard the Oasis of the Seas, from which rescue crews have repeatedly evacuated sick workers to hospitals in Florida, that the captain made an announcement over the loudspeaker asking crew members not to video their co-workers being taken off the ship in ambulances, according to an account from an employee given to the Miami Herald.Another member of the class-action suit against Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by Royal Caribbean, is Julia Melim, a US resident who hosted the Celebrity Infinity’s shopping and port-tourism show on the shipboard TV channel. Melim was one of only seven crew members allowed to leave the ship in Miami last week. The rest remain aboard. She says there was so much sickness that the ship’s medical personnel cleared out the whole third floor to isolate and treat people who had symptoms.The cruise industry says cruise lines were just as blindsided by the pandemic as the rest of the world and that those on ships haven’t suffered higher infection rates than those on land.A spokesperson for Celebrity Cruises said: “We have no higher priority than keeping our guests and crew safe, healthy, cared for and well-informed. We have at all times worked in close coordination with government and health authorities and are grateful for their guidance. We are working with all appropriate authorities to ensure the safe return home of all our crew members.”The Cruise Line Industry Association says it is still assembling information on how many of its ships have been affected, but says it so far knows of 899 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on board 15 ocean-going cruise ships.Those numbers appear to grossly underestimate the problem, given that the Diamond Princess alone had more than 600 cases. Another cruise ship, the Ruby Princess, which is blamed for spreading the disease around Australia in March, has now surpassed the Diamond Princess in the scale of its deadly outbreak – 21 people died and 900 were infected aboard the ship.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has specifically identified cruise ships as being global spreaders of coronavirus.“Cruise ships are often settings for outbreaks of infectious diseases because of the semi-enclosed environment and contact between travelers from many countries,” said a 4 April CDC order, barring those leaving cruise ships from taking any commercial flights in the US. “Outbreaks of Covid-19 on cruise ships pose a risk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage.”Most ships have only one doctor and a few nurses for thousands of passengers and crew, workers say The ships generally rely on hospitals on shore for urgent care. Because of the pandemic, however, the US and other ports are refusing to take all but the most dire cases.“They are basically getting no healthcare,” says Michael Winkleman, the attorney in Miami who filed the class-action suit. “They are locked in their rooms and told they can call an advice line for help. But when they call, no one comes.”Cruise lines have little recourse in seeking government help for urgent healthcare. While many of the major cruise companies, including Carnival and Royal Caribbean, are headquartered in the US, the companies are registered in low-tax countries. Carnival is technically a Panamanian company and Royal Caribbean is registered in Liberia, meaning they pay almost no US taxes.Likewise their ships are typically flagged in countries such as the Bahamas or Bermuda, which allows them to avoid strict safety standards, labour laws and environmental restrictions they might otherwise face in the US.A ship flying a flag of convenience means the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own. The ship flies the ensign or flag of that country, known as the flag state and operates under its laws, typically laxer than the owner’s own.For a ship owner, the advantage of this arrangement includes comparatively fewer regulations, lower employment requirements, and thus cheaper labour, cheaper registration fees and lower or no taxes.For crew members, the disadvantages tend towards lower working standards, fewer rights and little protection. They are opposed by the International Transport Workers\u0027 Federation.Panama, which has the largest ship registry globally, followed by Liberia, operates an “open registry”, allowing foreign owners to register ships under its flag. It guarantees anonymity to the owners, making it difficult for them to be held to account.The practice began in the 1920s in the US, when owners of cruise ships registered their vessels in Panama so that they could serve their passengers alcohol during Prohibition.“Foreign-flagged ships that loiter beyond US territorial seas, particularly those registered in the Bahamas” should seek assistance from the countries where they are flagged, it added.Officials in the Bahamas responded with their own memo, saying the medical system of the tiny Caribbean island nation would be overwhelmed if it had to take on caring for all those sick aboard cruise ships.“The cruise industry is facing an unprecedented crisis, and we in the Bahamas, facing the same global crisis, are doing what we can to provide support,” said the statement by the ministry of transport and local government. “Our system is not designed to deal with a massive influx of new Covid-19 patients from outside our country.”On some ships, crew members say they are being treated well, and some have been moved to passenger cabins with balconies and more space in which to spend their quarantine. Crew on the Celebrity Serenade made a parody video of their time confined to their cabins at sea. Some reported getting bonuses from their cruise lines. The Celebrity Edge, currently floating in the Bahamas, distributed a video of the ship’s captain delivering meals to the rooms of quarantined workers.On other ships, the situation is dire. Workers have complained that food seemed to be running out, and that they were forced to pay for internet time.Many crew have had their pay cut off entirely. Workers on board several ships run by the Geneva-based MSC cruise line, according to letters from MSC seen by the , are no longer being paid after their contracts ran out or were terminated early by the company because of the global pandemic. A spokesperson for MSC cruises said: “MSC Cruises has taken the difficult decision to temporarily suspend its cruise ship operations. As this health crisis has caused all our ships globally to stop operating, we have temporarily agreed to relieve the majority of our crew from their duties and are working to identify and pay for flight tickets for each and every one to safely return home for the duration of the temporary suspension of ships’ operations. We are offering all those who remain on board full board and lodging free of charge, assigning each of them a guest cabin for inidual use.”A former crew member for another major cruise liner, Krista Thomas, who lives in Vancouver, has been running a private Facebook group to update crew members at sea about how to get home.She says many crew are scared to speak out. They depend on the cruise industry for livelihoods, and cruise ship pay – while low compared to average wages in many developed countries – is often many times higher than what they can earn at home.“They’re probably not just taking care of a wife and kids they’re taking care of parents and in-laws,” says Thomas. “They are living contract to contract to get by … They don’t want to tear the industry down. It has taken a huge hit because of what’s happened and they don’t want to see their industry fall apart.”Ross Klein, who has written books criticising the cruise industry and runs a website that reports incidents involving cruises, says crew members from developing countries “are in as close to indentured servitude as it gets”. He argues that the cruise companies bear a responsibility to care for them.“The workers are powerless,” he says. “The employers have a moral and ethical duty to care for these people they brought from around the world. There have got to be ways to work out a solution to get these people safely home.”Alexandra Nedeltcheva, still experiencing the symptoms of Covid-19, has had to pay for an Airbnb to quarantine near her home in Bulgaria, so she doesn’t expose her family. She still worries about her friends aboard the Celebrity Apex in Saint-Nazaire in France. There, as of 14 April, two workers remained hospitalised with severe Covid-19 and 700 crew were still working or isolating, according to a report by a French TV station.Nedeltcheva says she has enjoyed seeing the world in her 11 years working with Celebrity Cruises, but the treatment she says crew have received during the pandemic has opened her eyes.“I really want something to change,” she says. “They can take much better care of their crew. It’s time the cruising industry does better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62a1b9bbbb233188b1d8b847f008e130db6cbda8/0_0_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=264f56faa2dce3c8943fe69ae0b59062","title":"water shutoffs us coronavirus utilities economy","story":"As the pandemic leaves millions without work, taps are turned off even as the CDC calls for frequent hand-washingJoshua Haynes was raised to work hard and take care of his family without asking for outside help. But when the utility bills arrived last month, he knew there would be trouble.Haynes, 34, a construction worker from Newbern, Tennessee, was left without income after the governor issued a stay-at-home order in early April. As a cash-in-hand builder, he is not eligible to claim unemployment insurance, and the stimulus cheque still had not arrived.“I always pay my bills on time, but without work, I just didn’t have the money to cover everything, so I asked for an extension. They said no,” Haynes said.Haynes, who lives with his wife and three children, managed to get the money just six days after the bill was due, but the city refused to accept the payment unless he also paid a $70 reconnection charge. He didn’t have it, and the charge didn’t make sense as they had not been disconnected. A few hours after his payment was turned down, the taps were turned off, even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urged people to frequently wash their hands in order to prevent the virus spreading.For a week, the family survived on sodas and microwave meals, cleaning their hands with gel and flushing the toilet with buckets of water filled at a neighbour’s.In the end, Haynes returned to work despite the stay-at-home order so that he could get an advance on his wages to pay the reconnection fee. “It’s wrong what they did, especially with so many people out of work. I felt angry and embarrassed. I’d never missed a bill before … I had no choice but to go back to work,” he said.Haynes is among a rapidly growing number of working people faced with impossible economic and health tradeoffs during the coronavirus pandemic – which has so far left more than 61,000 Americans dead and 30 million unemployed.A third of American households – about 120 million people – still risk having their water disconnected and racking up exorbitant fees, despite calls from a coalition of lawmakers and advocates to suspend all utility shutoffs until the country drags itself out of this unprecedented crisis. And while more than 600 localities and 13 states have mandated moratoriums on disconnecting residents since early March, some of these will soon expire as states reopen for business.In Tennessee, where the energy burden is also very high, the governor has resisted calls for a statewide moratorium, claiming utility companies – like socially distancing residents – can be trusted to do the right thing.Deborah O’Barr, 62, from Goodspring, has lived without running water since 2016. It’s a complicated situation: she and her husband, Bobby, 63, who are both disabled, bought the house in a private sale, assuming it would be easy enough to get the water reconnected – it was shut off before they moved in because of unpaid bills.It was not reconnected, and for four years they have relied on a local spring and their son for water to cook with and drink, as well as rainwater for the toilet and cleaning.According to the local water department’s rules, O’Barr must prove that she is the legal homeowner, and then pay $1,050 for a new meter. But the deeds are still in the name of the previous owner, who is in prison on remand, and even if this could be resolved, O’Barr says she doesn’t have the money.“It feels like nobody cares. We must be the lowest of the low as far as the water company is concerned. We just don’t matter, not even during a pandemic,” said O’Barr.Even before the current crisis, water affordability was a growing nationwide problem, after years of price hikes left an expanding number of low-income households struggling to pay bills.As a result, some public water utilities increased shutoffs, ostensibly to encourage people to pay up on time: about one in 20 households were disconnected in 2016, according to research by Food and Water Watch (FWW). In addition, more than 2 million people do not have indoor plumbing –  no running water or flushing toilet.Nationwide, nobody knows how many Americans were without water at the start of the pandemic – nor how many have been disconnected since.What is known is that financial aid to help families and utilities keep taps running has so far been excluded from federal rescue packages. The water and sewage industries estimate $26.4bn in lost revenue, mostly as a result of the industrial and business lockdown – which is fuelling concern that small towns may feel forced to sell off their utilities to big for-profit corporations.“It is appalling that the federal government is still dragging its feet,” said Mary Grant of FWW. “Congress must act in the public’s interests and order a national moratorium on water shutoffs while providing financial relief to our local public water providers. Our communities are in crisis and can’t wait any longer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b96da61c09c634355f9cebe8a81737b6077a5e0/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5628470cf50e631da26c5948b2557b2 700w","title":"gael garcia bernal the pandemic has taught me that i need something to say","story":"He’s played a revolutionary hero, a horny teen – now Gael García Bernal is a reptilian choreographer in Ema, and locked down in Mexico city. Just don’t ask him to move to LA when all this is overAt the start of the century, the director Alfonso Cuarón was casting Y Tu Mamá También, the bawdy but plangent road movie he had written with his brother Carlos about two oversexed Mexican teenagers, the wealthy Tenoch and his poorer, grungier friend Julio. “Alfonso called me very excitedly,” recalls Carlos Cuarón. “He said: ‘I know who’s going to play Julio! I’ve seen him in Alejandro’s movie.’” Alejandro González Iñárritu, that is, whose ferocious dog-fighting drama Amores Perros was about to be released. “I said: ‘No, no, I’ve found Julio I saw the perfect actor in this short film, De Tripas, Corazón. He’s incredible: his eyes, the way he manages silence ...’”Eventually, the brothers realised they were talking about the same person: Gael García Bernal, who was then just 21. The son of theatre actors, he had become a star in his early teens on the Mexican soap opera El Abuelo y Yo (Grandpa and I) before decamping to London to study at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. Iñárritu plucked him out mid-term for Amores Perros and he stole that movie as the twitchy-hipped tearaway who was every bit as feral as his champion rottweiler. His mutable features could switch from cherubic to lupine to gravely smouldering his nerve endings felt exposed like frayed electrical wires.“You can feel all his emotions, all his vulnerability,” says Cuarón. “He fills the screen completely. After my wife met him, she said: ‘Wow, he’s so handsome, but I thought he would be tall.’ He’s like Al Pacino or Dustin Hoffman, the kind of actor whose aura and energy makes you think they’re huge.”In that wham-bam first half-decade of Bernal’s film career, he gave four killer performances, any one of which would have been enough to build a reputation on: Amores Perros, Y Tu Mamá También, Pedro Almodóvar’s Bad Education, part of which he spent looking ravishing in drag, and The Motorcycle Diaries, in which he played a young Che Guevara. Now 41, Bernal has alternated between mainstream projects in the US – such as his five-year stint as an eccentric conductor in the delightful Amazon series Mozart in the Jungle, or his touching voice work as a balladeer trapped in the afterlife in the Disney Pixar gem Coco – and politically charged work in Latin America.When he calls me today, it is from Mexico City, one of two locations that is home to him (the other is Buenos Aires) and where he happened to be when the lockdown began. “What’s beautiful right now in Mexico,” he says brightly, “is that straight after the daily 7pm press conference, there are films on TV from the golden age of Mexican cinema, from the 1930s to the 1950s. It’s been wonderful to watch them in this light. I see the hopes of the actors and film-makers from 70 or 80 years ago. I see their fears, their experiments, what they were trying to build and express. I find it all incredibly moving as a document of humanity.”He thinks the current crisis is altering for ever the way we look at art. “There’s something more straightforward now in how we see things – it’s stronger, more elemental and pulsating. We’re so emotionally charged. Artistic expression can affect us for the better, making us feel we’re all in this questioning together.”It is, he suggests, an ideal state in which to approach Ema, his third film with the Chilean director Pablo Larraín, following No, about the 1988 plebiscite on Pinochet, and the fantasy-biopic Neruda, in which he played a police inspector who doubts his own existence. Ema is the pair’s most challenging collaboration, populated largely by destructive and dislikable characters only gradually do their prickly exteriors peel away to reveal the wounded souls within. Bernal has the small but pivotal role of Gastón, a choreographer married to the dancer Ema (Mariana Di Girolamo). He is plainly callous – he taunts her over their recent failed adoption of a seven-year-old boy – but Bernal shows that Gastón is suffering, too.“There is something about the nature of his job that makes him feel very lonely. That was interesting to explore: he’s the centre of gravity at this dance company, he puts everything together, and that leads to a lot of loneliness. It’s like directing a film, which is a solitary pursuit even though it’s collective.” Bernal himself has directed two features – the 2007 drama Déficit and the as-yet-unreleased Chicuarotes, about young Mexican hoodlums – as well as founding, with his childhood friend and Y Tu Mamá También co-star Diego Luna, two production companies and a documentary film festival, Ambulante.So could Gastón be a portrait of himself or Larraín? “No, not at all!” he laughs. “But Pablo and I both understand him in his isolation and his stupefaction.” Perhaps, then, he is comparable to Rodrigo, the conductor from Mozart in the Jungle, who is also a restless, demanding creative type? “Yes! Except that Rodrigo represents happiness and adventure, whereas Gastón is the opposite. Rodrigo is Maradona. Gastón is more like Mike Tyson.”His role in Ema is notable for keeping his usual electrifying charm in check if Gastón is sexual, it is only in the most remote, reptilian way. Such unpalatable parts are rare on Bernal’s CV. In Fernando Meirelles’s Blindness, he played an unscrupulous bartender taking advantage of an epidemic that renders its sufferers sightless in one scene, he performed a head-waggling, bad-taste version of I Just Called to Say I Love You. And in The King, his English-language debut from 2005, he was a psychopath calmly wreaking revenge on his long-lost father.“Gael had balls, to be blunt,” says James Marsh, that picture’s British director. “We went to quite a few up-and-coming young American actors, some of whom have big careers now, and none of them would go near that script. But Gael liked the idea of playing someone with this cold surface. I love way he moves in the film: he’s always slinking around, more animal than human. The character has pure evil in him, but he played it in this blank way so that you didn’t hate him.”Nor, by the end of Larraín’s picture, do we hate Gastón. Whether we understand him is another matter, one that Bernal thinks may not be so important. “That’s always the dilemma, right? Understanding. What the hell does it mean? There is that saying. I think it was Picasso, no? Someone said they didn’t understand his work. So he asked them: ‘You like eating eggs in the morning? You like your huevos rotos?’ ‘Yeah, I like them.’ ‘OK. But do you understand them?’” He chuckles at that.It is better, he says, for the audience to “know that they don’t know” the character’s motivations. “That’s the journey you embark on when you’re building a character. Little by little, the pieces come together. OK, how would this character feel in the rain? What would he do outside? And you start to discover them. Playing Rodrigo in Mozart in the Jungle, there came a point where I could improvise a whole day of his life. I had that ownership of what he would do in any situation. That’s the nirvana of acting: being able to go into places where you’re not sure what the hell is going to happen.”Saffron Burrows, one of Bernal’s co-stars on Mozart in the Jungle, witnessed his process up close. “There’s this incredible ease about Gael,” she tells me. “One thing that was so enjoyable was his improvising, the little riffs he developed, the surprises. Every take was very different. I think he works far harder than one would imagine. Sometimes we’d be doing the same scene for nine hours and I’d see him mulling, working stuff out, honing it.” She and Bernal go way back: they starred together as honeymooners in David Nicholls’s short play Aftersun, staged at the Old Vic in 2005.Burrows even recalls frequenting the bar where he worked while he was a drama student in the late 90s. “I used to go bobbing about with friends at this Cuban place in Islington where he was the barman. He’s had that London training and he’s always carried this internationalism about him. He’s very welcoming. When we were making Mozart, he was always at the helm, always being the host.”Although necessarily remote as Gastón, he does get to reveal the character’s churning inner turmoil during a frantic speech railing against his wife’s lifestyle. “There are some opinions he has which I share,” Bernal says. “When he mocks the idea of going to Los Angeles and taking selfies, for instance. I would say there is no bigger treason for humankind. It’s throwing your life away. I know it sounds horrible. But going to Los Angeles and taking selfies serves absolutely no transcendent purpose!”Bernal resisted that city’s siren call even before he and his former partner, the Argentine actor Dolores Fonzi, had two children: a son, Lázaro, now 11, and a daughter, Libertad, who is nine. He stayed put. “Not because I didn’t want to take selfies! There are just so many stories I wanted to tell. I wanted to change things with my own hands, not follow someone else’s route.”Marsh thinks that Bernal’s integrity is vital to his acting. “I have enormous respect for him and how he refused to take the easy path. He could easily have gone to Hollywood and become Antonio Banderas, but he didn’t. He’s stretched himself and matured into a great artist.” Cuarón, who went on to direct Bernal and Luna in the football saga Rudo y Cursi, agrees. “Gael and Diego are the most respected actors of their generation in Mexico. He’s involved with social issues like immigration, and he’s very outspoken politically. He is both criticised and celebrated, depending on who is in government here. And though he has lived everywhere, he has never left Mexico or stopped being involved in Mexican issues.”Even noble, conscientious actors are only human. Has he ever taken any roles purely for the money? “Oh, there have been one or two,” the actor says ruefully. I invite him to name and shame them, but he declines with a giggle: “Noooo!” So let’s just say it is oddly comforting that even a performer as good as he is can still make films as poor as Letters to Juliet, where he played Amanda Seyfried’s insufferable boyfriend, or A Little Bit of Heaven, in which he was an oncologist who falls for Kate Hudson as she dies photogenically and at great length.“I did certain projects I wasn’t too sure of,” he admits. “Sometimes there would be a pleasant surprise, sometimes a very bad one where I’d think: ‘It’s not worth it, man. What am I doing?’ If this pandemic has made me learn one thing, it is that I have to work less.

Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!Hurray! The football season is back! Six hundred years after the last match, everyone’s favourite sport has returned in the style we have come to know and follow with ill relish. And it’s all thanks to the French government, whose decision to ban team japes until September has kicked off the biggest hoohah since 2010, when Les Bleus decided it was simply impossible to envisage playing the World Cup so long as their manager spoke in a brusque tone.Following their government’s decree, the French league declared the season over and then confirmed the standings after 28 matches (27 in some cases) as the final table. That sealed a fairytale title triumph for the Embassy of Qatar, and Big Cup qualifications for Marseille and Rennes. But it also condemned Lyon to missing out on European competition for the first time in 24 years, and the club’s overlord, Jean-Michel Aulas, says that’s a bowl of sick he won’t swallow. “This is robbing us of an opportunity that is very significant, of high value,” he howled before vowing to deploy a crack squad of lawyers in an eat-this-mofos formation. “We are going to claim damages worth several dozen million euros,” stormed Aulas, scratching his nails down a chalkboard. “Noël Le Graët has to face the consequences as president of the FFF. His management here was poor. There were poorly thought-out decisions.”Aulas had proposed alternative ways of determining the final standings, including play-offs whenever, and pointed out that Lyon have a habit of finishing seasons strongly. A similar claim was made by the president of Amiens, who have been consigned to relegation. “Since our non-league days our success has always been built on our finishes to the season,” declared Bernard Joannin, the head of a club who had hope of survival despite being on a 13-match winless run. “I will go to the end to uphold our rights because I am a warrior. There were still 30 points up for grabs and we were just four below Nîmes! Football has shown a lack of humanity with this decision.” The only way to restore humanity, as everyone knows, is to call in the lawyers.“When he arrived I was the only person who spoke English.

The theory goes that players improve with greater experience before their fitness deteriorates and they inevitably get worse. However, a look back at the best players aged 21 or under in the 2009-10 season shows that not every promising youngster is destined for greater things.Vito Mannone makes our young team of 2009-10 by default as he was the only goalkeeper in the league who was 21 or under. He made five starts early in the season, keeping clean sheets in his first two outings – victories over Wigan and Fulham – before he shipped five goals in his next three matches and was quickly replaced by the returning Manuel Almunia.The Italian had to wait two years to play for Arsenal in the league again, enjoying two loan spells at Hull City in the interim. He was sold to Sunderland in 2013 and had an impressive start in the north east, winning the club’s player of the season award in his debut campaign. However, Mannone eventually lost his place and moved on to Reading, then Minnesota United and, this January, to Danish outfit Esbjerg on loan. Rating in 2009-10: 6.84Rafael was not a regular starter for Manchester United in the 2009-10 season, but he made a real impression when he was picked. The Brazilian deputised for Gary Neville and John O’Shea and boasted an unbeaten record in the league, winning six and drawing two of his eight appearances. He was always busy on the pitch – both in and out of possession – and he made outrageous average of 6.3 tackles per 90 minutes.Rafael featured more and more for the club and cemented his place as first-choice right-back in the 2012-13 season. He did not put in many ordinary performances he was either dazzling or disastrous. He was just too erratic for United and was eventually sold to Lyon in 2015. Now 29, he is still at Lyon, but he is not a guaranteed starter. Rating in 2009-10: 7.82Manchester United thought they saw a diamond in the rough, with Sir Alex Ferguson tipping him to become a club legend, yet he never really added polish to his game. It is telling that Jones made 29 appearances in his first season at United and has never matched that figure since. While injuries have played their part, his importance has waned over the last five years. However, the club did extend his until 2023 early last year. Rating in 2009-10: 7.24Jones’ arrival at Old Trafford was not good news for Jonny Evans, who was eventually deemed surplus to requirements. The Northern Ireland international made a promising start to his senior United career, although it was difficult to break into a team that contained Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand – even Gerard Piqué struggled with that challenge. Evans was not a standout player at United, but he was more consistent than many of the defenders who have been signed since he left the club.Since leaving United in 2015, he has been one of the most reliable defenders in the Premier League, initially at West Brom for three seasons and then at Leicester for the last two. Unlike many others on this list, he has definitely improved with age and experience. Rating in 2009-10: 7.36Emiliano Insúa joined Liverpool from Boca Juniors as a teenager in 2007 and became the club’s first choice right-back in the 2009-10 season. He was a steady performer, but Roy Hodgson was not convinced and replaced the youngster with Paul Konchesky in 2010, allowing Insúa to join Galatasaray on loan that same summer.Insúa has since played in Portugal for Sporting, in Spain for Atlético Madrid and Rayo Vallecano, and in Germany for Stuttgart. He signed for LA Galaxy on free transfer at the start of this year. Rating in 2009-10: 7.18Having joined Arsenal from São Paulo as an 18-year-old in 2006, Denilson was a regular in the team by the 2009-10 season. He scored three goals in his 20 league appearances that season and also made 6.5 tackles and interceptions per minutes – an excellent return.Nevertheless, he was allowed to return to São Paulo in 2011, initially on loan before signing permanently in 2013. A move to Abu Dhabi followed, then another loan back to Brazil with Cruzeiro before a knee injury ultimately ended his career. He signed for second-tier side Botafogo in 2019 after two years out, but he made just one appearance for the club before being released last year. Rating in 2009-10: 7.26Having arrived at Arsenal from French club Bastia way back in 2005, Alex Song enjoyed his breakthrough season in 2009-10. The Cameroon international started 25 games in the league and really shone in his defensive midfield role, ranking 13th in the league for tackles per game (3.3) and eighth for interceptions (3.1).He remained an important player for the club for the next two seasons before a surprise move to Barcelona. Song struggled to hold down a starting place, but he did pick up a league title with the club before returning to London with West Ham in 2014. He has since played in Russia for Rubin Kazan and in Switzerland for Sion. He was in the news recently when he and eight of his Sion teammates were sacked by the club, reportedly because they refused to take pay cuts following the coronavirus outbreak. Rating in 2009-10: 7.50Marouane Fellaini was an unmistakable figure from the moment he arrived at Everton from Standard Liège in 2008 for a club record fee of £15m. Fellaini became an instant hit with fans, if not opposing players, becoming renowned for flailing his long limbs around and taking no prisoners on the pitch.Initially signed as a defensive midfielder, his move to a more attacking role in the 2012-13 season reaped great reward for David Moyes, who took the Belgian with him to Old Trafford the following season. Fellaini had his moments in a United shirt, chipping in with some important goals, but he did not win over crowd. Last February, he made a cut-price move to Chinese Super League club Shandong Luneng, for whom he has scored eight goals in 22 league games. Rating in 2009-10: 7.49Gary Megson signed Lee Chung-yong for Bolton from FC Seoul in 2009 and the South Korean became an instant first-team regular. Megson lost his job a few months later, but the winger kept his place under new manager Owen Coyle, scoring four goals and setting up three more in his 34 league appearances in the 2009-10 season.Industrious without ever really getting bums off seats, Lee had a prominent role in the team the following season, but a leg fracture kept him out of the 2011-12 campaign, when Bolton were relegated. After a few years in the Championship, he earned a move to Crystal Palace – and a return to the Premier League – in the winter window of 2015. He never really nailed down a starting place in his three years at Palace and moved on to Bundesliga II outfit Bochum in 2018. He has since returned to the K-League with Ulsan Hyundai. Rating in 2009-10: 7.00Gareth Bale is the real star in this line-up, yet he started the 2009-10 campaign with an unwanted record: he had played in 24 games in the Premier League without ever winning one. That unwanted record perhaps deterred Harry Redknapp from starting the teenager – a left-back at this point – more often. Indeed, Bale was not in the starting XI until January, but he play every minute of the final 18 matches of the season.Bale finished the 2009-10 season as a winger, having scoring three goals and registered five assists. He has never looked back. He won the Premier League player of the year award in the 2012-13 season before moving to Real Madrid for a world record fee that summer. He made a superb start to his career in Spain and has won La Liga, the Copa del Rey and four Champions League titles, but injuries have restricted his playing time in recent years. He has a tumultuous relationship with Zinedine Zidane and has only started 11 league matches this season, at a standard substantially below his brilliant best. Rating in 2009-10: 7.65Nicklas Bendtner was something of a cult figure at Arsenal. His off-field antics and at times over-inflated sense of self-belief have earned him near comedy status in the game. Yet he was a handy player on his day. Bendtner enjoyed his best form between 2008 and 2010, having joined the Arsenal academy in 2004. He started just 13 of his 23 league matches in 2009-10, but chipped in with six goals and five assists. His high number of shots – 3.9 shots per 90 minutes – highlights how much confidence he had in his own ability.However, Arsène Wenger did not share his confidence and by 2011 Bendtner had been sent to Sunderland on loan. Bizarrely, he also had a loan spell with Juventus the following season. He started just two Serie A matches in Italy before finally leaving Arsenal on a free transfer to Wolfsburg in 2014, where he would start just nine Bundesliga games across two seasons.After a brief stint back in England with Nottingham Forest, he moved to Rosenborg in Norway, where he found his level with an impressive 19 goals in his debut season. That form did not continue, however, and he returned to Denmark with FC Copenhagen last summer. He was released by the club before the end of the year and, like his former teammates Denilson and Song, the striker is once again a free agent.

But for Nicoló Lanfranchi, capturing the burial of Covid-19 victim Elizabeth Baez, 82, which took place this month at the São João Batista cemetery in Rio de Janeiro, was especially difficult.As he photographed the gravediggers in protective clothing with Elizabeth’s son Henrique, 49, the only mourner allowed, watching on from behind a mask, Lanfranchi thought of his own father, Piero. At 72, Piero was in intensive care with Covid-19 in a hospital in Voghera, in Lombardy, northern Italy – one of the worst-affected places on Earth.“I imagined myself in the same situation, and I started facing this possibility and I was really touched,” he says. After the funeral, Lanfranchi told Baez about his father. Baez thanked him for capturing his mother’s lonely burial – and for sharing his own story.That Brazilians – a sociable, gregarious people - are so open to brief yet profound human interactions like this is just one of the many reasons Italian photographer and film-maker Lanfranchi has returned here every year for the past two decades. The other is to take pictures.“It is a huge life school for me. I have to be focused, it is dangerous, no one can help me and I feel responsibility to bring back images and the stories,” he says. “It cleans my mind.”Born in Milan and based in Berlin, Lanfranchi has worked as a freelance photographer in portrait, travel, news, and photojournalism. He prefers to spend time on assignments he once spent three weeks on board the Aquarius ship as it rescued refugees around the Mediterranean for a series of  dispatches.Coronavirus has been one of the toughest subjects to cover. “I’ve been worried about the virus,” he says. “My father was on my mind.”Lanfranchi first came to Brazil in 2000 because he practises the Afro-Brazilian art of capoeira and came to be “baptised” in an initiation. Originally developed by enslaved African people as a martial art disguised as a dance, capoeira is an example of how this vast, varied country absorbs cultures.“Other people call this a melting pot. It is more the syncretism, the capacity of an organic form to absorb different things,” says Lanfranchi.In 2012 he photographed wildcat miners in the jungle, in 2014 a soccer tournament in a prison in João Pessoa. In 2015 Brazil suffered the worst environmental catastrophe in its history when a tailings dam near Mariana collapsed, killing 19 people and sending millions of litres of mining waste sluicing down the River Doce to the sea.Lanfranchi worked with Greenpeace, Amnesty, Vanity Fair and eventually supplied dramatic images images for a  story that Davilson Brasileiro and I wrote about an investigation into the disaster’s causes by federal prosecutors.In January 2019, Lanfranchi and I had just left the Raposa Serra do Sol indigenous reserve in Brazil’s far north when another tailings dam collapsed, in Brumadinho in the same state of Minas Gerais, killing hundreds. At the disaster zone, Lanfranchi’s persistence, his ability to charm and cajole, and his skill at composing photographs in chaos rendered memorable images of the deadly, avoidable tragedy.He arrived in Rio on 3 March to make a short film about traditional medicine in Brazil’s semi-arid interior, but the pandemic shelved the project. Isolating in Rio’s beachside Ipanema neighbourhood, Lanfranchi discovered that the great composer Tom Jobim had written many of his bossa nova classics in an apartment in his building, including Chega de Saudade (Enough of Longing), most famously recorded by João Gilberto.That nostalgia infected Lanfranchi and he sought to take photos that captured time standing still and the fearful melancholy of a city where life was on hold.He bought N95 masks, found a driver who knew the city and began working out how to photograph the pandemic when so many situations – health centres and hospital wards – were inaccessible. He cleaned his equipment with alcohol gel, and changed and washed his clothes each time he got home.Using a drone worked for photographing empty beaches and an upscale members’ club for a story on how coronavirus spread among its privileged members. He also used it to capture families on their balconies.He put the drone down to capture food distribution in the City of God favela, street sanitation in nearby Niterói, and people ignoring social distancing advice across Rio.Some did this from sheer economic need, others didn’t take the pandemic seriously. The country’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, dismissed coronavirus as “a little flu” and argued that protecting the economy was more important than social distancing even as confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths rose.Lanfranchi was dismayed to see Brazilian solidarity corroded by fake news and far-right populism. “I felt how sick the country is, people are supporting a president who openly does not care about the health of the population,” he says.This disconnect resonated as his father’s health worsened. Piero Lanfranchi had gone to hospital to get a plaster removed but caught Covid-19. Father and son communicated via text, until the time came for a plastic box to be put over Piero’s head to help him breathe and he sent a last message.Lanfranchi could not have seen his father even if had been able to get a flight back to Italy. Hospital visitors are not allowed, there are road blocks in Lombardy. On Saturday he got the news: despite the plastic box, his father had died.“He was alone, this is the worst thing, and something I wouldn’t wish on anybody,” says Lanfranchi, tears cracking his voice.Now the only thing he can think to do is plan a new assignment.“This is a historical moment, it is leaving a mark on me, and in a certain way I think about the other families affected with this, and I am with them,” he says. “I do not want to be beaten by the virus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short? Being confined to quarters is helping us rediscover a new sense of community.Every day brings more inspiring and creative digital gatherings, whether it’s quarantine quizzes, online aperitivo or friends slogging up their staircases thousands of times in a bid to conquer a virtual Everest. While we’re all busy rearranging our lives to adjust to the new norm, internet providers are doing their bit too. Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra.

An expedition team of 30 climbing friends in the UK recently clambered up a virtual Mount Everest – all 8,848m of it – by trudging up stairs, steps and ladders within their own homes (often kitted up in full mountaineering gear). Elsewhere, tourist attractions such as the Louvre, British Museum and New York’s Guggenheim now offer 360-degree videos and livestreaming on their websites.

On ourselves, our relationships and what’s important to us. For some of us, that means reaching out to old friends, or healing old wounds with people we once thought we’d never speak to again. And in a way, the tech that helps us reconnect makes repairing those relationships easier: the screen gives us an element of safety, yet we can tap directly into those emotional connections we need to get us through this crisis.Here, three people who found isolation has had a positive effect on their relationships share their experiences – from building bridges, to creating the foundations for better communication, and reconnecting with family members they haven’t spoken to in years …Emma*: ‘Coronavirus gave me a reason to reach out to my brother’“I’d always had a good relationship with my brother, but it came crashing down last Christmas when my family discovered he’d been keeping his gambling addiction from us. He’d even taken money from Mum, and I was upset that he could put her through so much stress – I just couldn’t bring myself to speak to him. But after chatting to Mum over the past couple of weeks and hearing that he’d been helping her with food deliveries while she’s been in isolation, I decided to reach out. I sent him a text first and then he called me and we chatted about coronavirus and how we’ve been coping – a few days later, he FaceTimed me and gave me a tour of his new flat that I’ve never visited. I’d wanted to reach out to him before, but I was struggling to know how, so while lockdown is a very weird situation, it gave us both an excuse to push our differences to one side.“I also realised that life is too short – if my mum could move past what had happened, so could I. In fact, I’m probably speaking to him more now than I ever did before.”Michael: ‘Lockdown made me realise what’s important’“My ex-partner and I split a year ago and we share a young daughter, but our relationship has been really rocky ever since we broke up. We’d fight all the time and nasty words would be fired back and forth at each other over text message. But when the lockdown happened, it really made me take a step back and think about what’s important.“I reached out to her via text and also sent her some money for petrol, as she is driving our daughter between our two houses during this time – I wanted to make sure she knew I appreciated that she was helping me to see my daughter. It has felt like a real turning point for us and our relationship and it’s a really positive outcome from a situation that is out of our control. Now my daughter is with me and I’ve been sending my ex-partner pictures and we’ve been having civil conversations. Without this happening, I don’t know if we’d have ever reached this point.”Jo: ‘I’m connecting with family members I haven’t spoken to in years’“We have an extended family WhatsApp group made up of the descendants of my grandparents, both of whom sadly passed away recently. We used to use it every so often to share pictures from when people visited them, but over the years as inidual families grew, and as my grandparents got more frail, we didn’t have the same opportunities to gather together. And for some of the family, my only contact was an annual Christmas card. Since everyone has been staying at home for the past few weeks, though, the group has blown up with almost daily messages – pictures of the great-grandchildren doing their home school work, baking or learning to ride bikes without stabilisers in abandoned car parks.“My mum and dad both work in the NHS, with more than 60 years of service between them, so everyone shared videos from the 8pm clap for the NHS in recognition. And my brother, who’s a musician, livestreamed a gig on Facebook and lots of the family who’ve never had the opportunity to see him play before got to watch. It’s really lovely to feel connected to everyone, particularly as the two people that held us all together are no longer here.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedFamily has rarely felt more precious, nor has staying in touch with each other and the world.

By  Marisa MeltzerHop into something comfy and let’s get started!” This is how Adriene Mishler, YouTube’s biggest yoga guru, begins many of her videos. For those of us who are not spending our quarantine days writing an update of King Lear or attempting to follow along with Barry’s Bootcamp on Instagram, Mishler’s just-show-up approach to yoga is a comfort and a welcome distraction. In recent months, she has been described as “the patron saint of quarantine” (Paper magazine), “the most influential yoga teacher on the planet” (Refinery29), and “Our saviour” (a fan on Twitter).Mishler was already huge before the pandemic – her channel, which has more than 7 million subscribers, is the first to pop up when you search for “yoga” on YouTube – but the lockdown has catapulted her to a new level of fame. Fans on social media recommend their favourite videos, post charcoal drawings of her and express their undying devotion to her for keeping them sane. One devotee even built a digital replica of her home studio in the video game Animal Crossing. There are countless memes about her, as well as ones about her dog, a blue heeler, or Australian cattle dog, named Benji, who frequently makes cameo appearances lounging beside the mat, or wandering into shot.Working out at home in the time of coronavirus is fraught. Most of us don’t have much space to spare, let alone weights or props to replicate the gym (or a steam room or a woman arguing on her phone while jogging on a treadmill next to you). But even for those of us committed to being deeply unambitious during this period, exercise does eventually seem like a good idea, if not just to make up for all the pasta dinners and handfuls of milk chocolate – also to alleviate boredom, or sore backs from sitting cross-legged on the couch all day, or to introduce some movement beyond padding in slippers a few feet from the bedroom to a makeshift standing desk (a laptop propped up on a cupboard), or to give the illusion of some form of routine.Even though every form of exercise, from pilates to ecstatic dance, is being offered in online workouts, and in many cases for free, yoga seems to have risen to the top. It doesn’t require any fancy accessories – you don’t even need a mat – and there’s a meditative aspect that helps with all of our extremely warranted anxiety.Mishler has pitched herself as the perfect first step for yoga novices. Whatever ails you, Mishler seems to have a class for it. She has videos for back pain, vulnerability (an entirely seated practice with a lot of lying in the foetal position), anger (a lot of breathing exercises and child’s pose to calm down) and self-care (literally hugging yourself). There is yoga for runners (a seven-minute full body stretch for before or after a jog) and for those in the service industry (relief from being on one’s feet all day), and even yoga for writers (“focus the brain and body inward so you can perform, create and be your best”). Some of the classes can be done in bed.Maybe what attracts so many people to Mishler is what she’s not: she isn’t threatening, has none of the holier-than-thou quality of someone who just came back from rigorous spiritual training, and nor is she stone-faced or humourless. On screen, Mishler, who is 35, comes across as sweet and wholesome, like the one popular girl in school who was actually kind. Her classes tend to be slow-placed, with clear instructions for absolute beginners and insight for more experienced students. She’s good at telling you how to avoid injury, which is important when there’s no teacher in the room to correct or guide you deeper into a pose. She can occasionally seem a little homespun – with her Texan “howdy” – or get a little spiritual and write on her website that “Yoga is really the art of waking up”.Right now, while we are stuck – in our cramped apartments, our crowded living rooms, our sunless basement flats, our solitary terraces – yoga offers us a solution, an escape, a way to unwind. It doesn’t come larded with the kind of ambition that drives people to train for marathons or visit the gym several times a week to lose weight. Yoga is only interested in the present, an apt philosophy at a moment when the future is so uncertain. As a teacher, Mishler is not doing anything revolutionary, but she has struck a chord in these anxious times. By not doing too much, and not asking us to do too much, she’s become the woman of the hour.These days Mishler receives so many requests that her press office sends automated emails apologising in advance if it takes a while to respond. But after I got through to her voicemail – which features her singing a song about leaving a message to the tune of the Chili’s “baby back ribs” jingle – Mishler called me back about a minute later, apologising for missing the call.On the phone from her home in Austin, Texas, Mishler sounded exactly like she does in her videos: extremely friendly, sincere and polite. She thanked me for asking how her quarantine is going. “It’s best-case scenario,” she said. “My boyfriend lives eight minutes away. He’s the only person that I see, and he can work at his home and I can work here. A lot of people assume I must be golden … Oh come on, buddy!” – she broke off to yell at Benji the dog, who was barking in the background. Others are having a much harder time of it, she said, such as her friends who have kids, but she admitted to having occasional wobbles. “You have your own discombobulated moment each day where you feel like you’re in the Groundhog Day movie.”Mishler grew up in an arty family in Austin. As a teenager, she took acting classes, in which she learned about mind-body practices such as yoga. Later, while trying to make it as a professional actor – among her early roles was a cameo as “cute female student” in an episode of the TV show Friday Night Lights – she qualified as a yoga teacher and taught some classes. Her main frame of reference for exercising at home was Jane Fonda’s classic 1980s do-it-for-the-burn aerobics videos, along with Rodney Yee’s yoga DVDs, which featured a lot of instruction but not much fun.The origins of Yoga With Adriene go back to the set of a horror movie, where she met an independent film-maker called Christopher Sharpe, who had helped create a popular YouTube channel starring his wife, the chef Hilah Johnson. Afterwards, Sharpe and Mishler stayed in touch, and in 2012, when Sharpe was looking for new YouTube projects, he asked Mishler if she wanted to start a yoga channel. In September that year, they began uploading videos.“I had this inkling, if we all had an at-home yoga practice, it would change everything – it could become like a normal hygiene practice, or saying a prayer if you’re a spiritual person,” Mishler told me. “A daily practice that can be medicinal – you could roll out the mat if you’re stressed. That was a huge stretch in 2012, but I was so broke that I thought it was worth a try.”Yoga studios and, really, gyms in general, can be intimidating places. There’s the fear of looking as if you don’t know what you’re doing. It’s easy to stand out by being the largest person in the room, or the only man in the yoga class, or the only woman lifting free weights, or the only person of colour, full stop. Plus, they’re expensive and they require commitment.Mishler’s channel aimed to remove these stresses. One thing that made her videos appealing was that they weren’t filmed in a professional studio or in a fancy home, settings that were popular in older workout videos. By filming in a private space – Mishler did her workout in a living room – the videos felt more intimate and personal, tapping into the same qualities that were becoming popular in other YouTube genres, from singing covers of a song in a bedroom to cooking in regular home kitchens.While the setting was clean and bright, it wasn’t aspirational, unlike the Rodney Yee videos, filmed on beaches with spectacular views or at the foot of snow-capped mountains. Mishler was just a nice-looking woman in a nice-enough room wearing a tank top and leggings that didn’t even match. It suited her, but it was also a deliberate decision – a strategy, even though she hates that word – to make her the yoga girl next door.In this, Benji is a useful ally. He serves not just as a beloved pet, but as a muse and a beacon of calm as he sleeps on the sidelines. “He is a great tool for the storytelling. His presence just lends itself so well to not feeling like it’s a super-produced video,” she said, and as if he knew he was being referenced, Benji barked several times in the background. “Benji is a way to tear down the fourth wall without being pretentious. Maybe that’s too heavy of a word. We’re here together and he helps set the tone.”As Mishler was crafting the channel’s tone, Sharpe was carefully studying how YouTube users search for yoga and other workouts, compiling lists of key terms and optimising the titles of the videos. Instead of just creating classes that might suit potential needs, they looked at Sharpe’s studies and tailored classes according to what people were searching for. This is why Mishler’s classes include Yoga for Back Pain, Yoga for Lower Back Pain, Yoga for Upper Back Pain, as well as Upper Back Love, and, of course, Lower Back Love.The YouTube channel wasn’t an overnight hit. It took about two years of posting a new video each week to reach 200,000 subscribers, and that was the point at which it started to become commercially successful. Mishler’s videos aren’t heavily branded, but the website Social Blade, which tracks growth on YouTube, estimates that the channel could make as much as $188,500 per month on advertising revenue alone.For hardcore fans looking to venture further into the Mishler universe, there is also a subscription service ($9.99 per month) called Find What Feels Good, in which the best-friend vibe is amped up even more, via exclusive classes, vlogs, meditations and blog posts. She also leads retreats, and holds large events for International Yoga Day each June. But this year, a retreat in Mexico City combining Spanish lessons and yoga – Mishler’s mother is Mexican – scheduled for May had to be cancelled, as did an upcoming event at the United Nations.On 12 April, Mishler began her email newsletter with the following: “I am sending you some loving energy from my humble abode. It is Sunday. Just in case you need a reminder.” And then she included a poem, which, depending on your perspective, will be either painfully twee or gently comforting:Today is another day in which we are blessed with the opportunity to rise,To continue, and awaken.To slowly nod with forgiveness,Squint the eyes –Just a bit,And whisper,I got this.I attended a Californian high school that offered yoga as part of its physical education programme. At 16 I signed up for it – along with all the other misfits who weren’t enrolled in typical private-school sports such as lacrosse or field hockey – and learned crow pose and breathing techniques from a long-haired ageing hippie with a gentle demeanour. I liked it enough, but didn’t take yoga classes again until after university, when I found myself living down the street from a yoga studio.In 2015, after I joined a studio in Manhattan, I would go to a yoga class every couple of days. This year I took the plunge, going from being a yoga student who attended class a few times a week to teaching a restorative yoga class once a week at a downtown studio called Sky Ting. I have never thought of myself as a natural teacher, but I loved it. Teaching was, frankly, kind of a power trip. I like being in charge, putting together a playlist, watching students tumble out of class in a relaxed afterglow. My classes were in the late afternoon on Thursdays. Friends came by, but so did people I didn’t know, and they started to come every week, which was thrilling: I knew what I was doing enough that people wanted more. I started in the second week of January, but was only able to teach for two months before business was suspended.On a recent Sunday evening, I taught one class via Instagram from my sitting room. My yoga studio provided its teachers with notes on setting up, from how to best position our phones to tips on creating as inviting a space as possible in a tiny New York apartment (plants and natural light are good, dirty floors and clutter are best avoided). I tend not to speak a lot during my classes. It’s a conscious choice based on years of wishing that I could zone out and not have to hear a teacher chattering along. But a lot of silence while demonstrating poses alone in front of a screen just translates to dead air, which feels awkward, so I found myself making commentary to fill up the silence. My class, like Mishler’s, was treated to a spontaneous appearance by my bulldog, Joan, when she wandered over to investigate what I was doing. I missed touching my students, running a hand down their spine to encourage deeper relaxation or massaging their foreheads to relieve tension. But I also loved that anyone could join, and students could say hello or send a comment through the app. (That said, I could have done without the person who kept messaging me to say I should change my music.)Because so many studios have taken their classes online, I’ve also got to tune into some of my favourite far-flung teachers and friends, from Portugal to Los Angeles. When I spoke to one of these teachers, Kyle Miller, about her experience of teaching on Zoom, she was near-rapturous. “Getting to see everyone, talk and hang out in the moments before and after class, getting to watch the students as they practise and teach right to them, it’s been incredible and unexpected,” she said. “It honestly feels like I’ve socialised. I ride a high after my streams!” Yoga teachers, it seems, are perhaps the world’s most gifted people when it comes to putting a positive spin on things.Mishler is not really a superstar teacher like the types who headline Wanderlust – the global travelling yoga festival that is sort of like Coachella for the spiritually inclined, at which fans shell out around $200 to take massive yoga classes led by teachers talking rapturously about the need to be humble. Nor is Mishler an influencer in the current sense, posing for highly branded and sponsored photos with perfect hair. Her own Instagram is simple and relatively unflashy, featuring photos of the sky, grocery store flowers and, of course, Benji. She is careful not to sound too out-there or new age, and will often poke fun at something she says by using an exaggeratedly calm, smug-yoga-lady voice. Her online persona recalls a time when normal people could become famous on the internet for being good at being themselves – Justin Bieber before he became Justin Bieber.Mishler acknowledges that she has made compromises to broaden her reach. She understands that she grew her audience based on a canny understanding of how to target her videos, but there is an awkward disconnect between the kind of yoga she wants to teach and what is most sought after on YouTube. Her most popular videos are, she said, “a tight race between anything that has ‘anxiety’ in the title and also the yoga for weight loss”. She feels weird about that, she says. “I do not teach yoga for weight loss, that’s not my end goal, but, you know, when that is in the title in the SEO, it attracts a lot more people than it would have otherwise,” she said, sounding a little defensive. “I know there is integrity in the content,” she said.While the coronavirus pandemic has brought legions of new fans, it might also mean that, for the first time, Yoga With Adriene could have some real competition. Every yoga brand is trying to ride out this wave of isolation and come out with more followers at the other end. Local studios from all over the world are live-streaming from home so students can take classes with their favourite teachers, not just what’s free on YouTube. Big brands are also pushing their online classes, including Nike, Alo, Gaia, Sweaty Betty, CorePower, Lululemon and Yoga Journal. Meanwhile, on YouTube, there are now numerous videos that seem to borrow heavily from Yoga With Adriene’s formula: accessible classes performed in homey environments. New competitors include Yoga By Candace and Yoga With Tim. They both include their dogs.Whenever we are let out of our homes, my guess would be that yoga studios will have waiting lists. They’ll likely be different from before, operating at no more than a quarter of their usual capacity allowing students (who’ll bring their own mats) to keep two metres apart. But even with those compromises, it will probably feel better than practising one more day in front of a screen.What seemed reassuring in quarantine might feel claustrophobic when we’re let out, and for Mishler, it’s possible that there might be a downside to being so closely associated with a strange and miserable time. While we all troop gratefully back to class, Mishler will still be taping herself at home, doing yoga to a camera in her sitting room, Benji by her side. But worrying too much about the future is not quite in the spirit of Yoga With Adriene, which is all about the here and now. As she writes on her website: “The process is the candy.

From there, we drove across 22 countriesMy girlfriend Romy and I are both from Bristol, but in 2016 were living apart. I was in London working as an accountant and she was teaching in Paris. We decided we wanted more time together and an adventure. We packed up our lives and moved to Queenstown, New Zealand. Our time there was amazing: we worked in the day and spent evenings waterskiing, mountain running or barbecuing on the beach.At weekends, we’d explore the South Island, but to do it properly you need a legendary vehicle, something that will just keep going. I found a knackered Toyota Land Cruiser for sale online. When went to take a look, it turned out to be a neglected prison vehicle with a bird living inside, but it was only £6,000. We spent 18 months repairing it. Then every weekend we’d chuck a mattress in the back and head off on escapades.After a few years, we decided to return to the UK and start building a more dependable life together. When it came time to say goodbye to New Zealand, we couldn’t leave the car behind. We researched the 25,000-mile drive from New Zealand to Bristol in depth. It would take 10 months and no one would insure us. But when our families said, “You can’t,” we thought, “Why not?”We set off on 16 February 2019 with a mattress, gas cooker, barbecue, two camping chairs, some clothes, a surfboard and a £50 daily budget for fuel and food. After a month on New Zealand’s North Island, we shipped the car to Malaysia and met it in Kuala Lumpur. From there, we drove across 22 countries: Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Iran, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, by ferry to Italy, Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium, France and Britain.As for the highlights – it’s hard to skip any part. Pakistan’s Passu Cones mountains in late summer provided the best view: I’ve never seen mountains so high. And the two-week drive through northernmost India’s Himalayas, from Manali to Leh, was among the best stretches of road. The locals were friendliest in Pakistan. We were invited to a stranger’s 40th birthday and given the first slice of cake. We’re still in touch over Facebook.Laos, with its limited tourist infrastructure, was the most rewarding adventure. We’d wake up with nothing between us and the sea but sand, and have khao soy (noodle soup) for breakfast with a bucket of fresh juice.Crossing the Pakistan-Iran border was the only hairy moment. Tourists are given an armed escort but, as we passed through a military base on the way to the border, the guards were tense and warned that the Taliban were in the area. We passed them several times as our escort yelled at me to keep driving. It was a terrifying half-hour before they dropped us off, but it’s the kind of experience that locals have daily.I serviced the car in most countries, every 3,000 miles. Those were some of my favourite moments. I’d borrow space in a local garage and hang with the mechanics for an hour, chatting using hand gestures.When we arrived in Britain on 11 December, I cried. The light on Dover’s cliffs was beautiful. I hadn’t seen family for two years. Our friends threw a party at the pub, and I proposed to Romy. Living out of a car together for 10 months felt like a bigger commitment than marriage – and we hadn’t argued once. She said yes.We loved how spontaneous our trip was: we would start each day not knowing where we’d end up pulling up at the first traffic lights, something or someone would set our whole day in motion.That can’t last for ever. We’re 30 and have been craving roots. We moved to Edinburgh in February. I’m working as an accountant again and Romy’s a social worker, but there’s unlimited potential for exploring here, hopefully with little ones one day.I love seeing the car parked on the driveway, knowing all the cool places it has been. I’m proud of it. Sometimes I’ll give it a kiss. I hope the three of us (me, Romy and the Land Cruiser) can still be together in our 70s, starting journeys together .• As told to Deborah LintonDo you have an experience to share?

It’s little more than a couple of weeks since he came out of intensive care and his partner has just given birth to a baby boy. But sounding breathless before he had even gasped out his opening sentence at his first Downing Street press conference since falling ill with the coronavirus probably wasn’t the commanding, reassuring presence he had hoped to convey.The Boss may be back, but the man who longed to be the new Churchill isn’t even the old Boris. The upbeat ebullience and jingoism no longer comes naturally. He can still come out with the same words, but he can no longer even bring himself to believe them. For the first time in his life, there are signs of self-doubt. When he looks in the mirror, he now sees his reflection beginning to fragment. His persona that has been carefully constructed over 55 years to protect himself from the pain of being himself is falling apart. Yet still he can’t quite access the humility that might go some way to healing himself.Not that Boris didn’t give it his best shot at papering over the cracks, but it cost him dear. By the end of the press conference he was just two pinprick, bloodshot eyes peeping out of an ashen-white face. If he really feels the need to get back to work so soon, then he can’t have much faith in the rest of his cabinet. There again, that’s one area where you can’t really fault his judgment.“I’m not going to minimise the lack of personal protective equipment or the failure to expedite testing,” he said. Before proceeding to do just that. The lack of PPE and adequate testing – today was the day we were supposed to have reached 100,000 daily tests – have been two of the leading factors in the UK’s mortality rate, but according to Boris the government hadn’t put a foot wrong. The lack of an apology becomes more insulting by the day to the families of the nearly 27,000 people who have died. It appears that the only people in the entire country not to have heard of the 2016 Exercise Cygnus, that highlighted the risks of a pandemic, are the entire government frontbench.Rejoice, rejoice. Sunlight was visible. We had avoided the worst-case scenario of 500,000 dead by burrowing under the alpine mountain. Boris appeared to have both forgotten that we were already well past the 20,000 “best-case result” of his chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, and that – even allowing for statistical variations – the UK had a fatality rate significantly higher than that of Germany or South Korea and might even have the worst record of any country in Europe.The line that the government did the right things at the right time becomes ever more untenable. What can’t be admitted is that Boris effectively took a 10-day holiday in March, at a time when he could have done more to protect the country. Seldom has so much been owed by so few to so many.Boris then breezed on to the R rate – AKA the reproduction rate. Here satire nearly died. For as scientists struggle to pin down the UK’s R rate to between 0.6 and 0.9, no one has the first idea of Boris’s own reproduction rate. We know its current level is at least six – though even Boris doesn’t appear to know if it’s more – and with every likelihood of adding to the score in the years ahead. If Boris were a virus he would be deadly.On and on he bumbled. We would have to wait until some time next week for the government to make it clear it still had no real plan for ending lockdown. Things were definitely getting better but no one had a clue how to ease things while ensuring R remained lower than one. Even Vallance and England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, couldn’t help Boris out with that one. The only certainty was more uncertainty.The questions only revealed how little everyone really knew, as Boris had no clear answers to anything. He couldn’t say anything on tourism to Cornwall – “there will be more information later” – and his suggestion that people with mental health issues should call NHS helplines rang hollow as successive Tory governments have cut mental health provision to a bare minimum. Even if you’re really desperate, you’re lucky to get an appointment inside six months these days. An embarrassed Whitty eventually had to intervene and point people in the direction of mental health charities if they needed urgent help.Otherwise, there was just more of the same. The scientists urging caution while Boris talked big about the economy bouncing back, avoiding the second peak and enforcing the wearing of face masks which only a month ago he had said were a waste of time. But deep down, Boris knows he’s met his match. Up till now, he’s never found a situation in his life which he couldn’t bluster his way out of. Now he’s come up against a power greater than himself coronavirus is so far immune to almost everything. In a straight contest between coronavirus and bullshit, the coronavirus wins every time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3688b4586d0bfebdd4f5980dc6dc67d832dd7b0/0_0_5825_3497/master/5825.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1df4c24bf8afd69b28139a0d3f1ef13b","title":"brexit could impede coronavirus contact tracing on island of ireland","story":"Northern Ireland’s health minister concedes no deal could jeopardise data sharingBrexit could put at risk the contact tracing of coronavirus patients on the island of Ireland if the UK crashes out of the EU without a trade deal at the end of the year, the health minister in the Northern Ireland assembly has conceded.Contact tracing in the region is expected to resume next week but may face challenges if the virus, as is probable, continues to threaten communities beyond the 31 December deadline for a Brexit trade deal, local politicians have said.The tracing of number plates, flight passenger lists and coronavirus test results could become impossible unless the UK agrees a deal on its future relationship with the EU that includes security and data-sharing arrangements.Data shared between authorities in Belfast and Dublin helped in February to trace passengers on a plane that landed in Dublin airport who may have had contact with a resident who went on to Northern Ireland and later tested positive for coronavirus.The Social Democrat and Labour party assembly member Matthew O’Tooleasked Swann if this would continue beyond December in the absence of a trade deal or extension to the transition period.“We will probably still be contact tracing people, we will still be moving from Dundalk to Newry and Buncrana to Derry,” said O’Toole in reference to border towns. “Is there a risk that if we leave the transition period without a deal and there is legal uncertainty around our information governance framework that would put contact tracing particularly in border areas into risk?”Swann replied that it had been flagged as an issue under Brexit’s Operation Yellowhammer contingency planning but that no action could be taken until they knew what shape Brexit would take.“Let’s get it up and running and we will work round the rest of it when we get to the end of the year and we see where we are in regards to Brexit.”Swann’s comments come as the European commission told the UK that time was short to implement the Northern Ireland protocol that Boris Johnson included in the withdrawal agreement in January.A technical note issued by Brussels put flesh on the bones of the protocol and served as a reminder of the scale of the challenge facing businesses and now health authorities in the face of a national health emergency.After the first meeting of the specialised committee of EU and UK officials tasked with implementing the Northern Ireland rules, the commission said the exchanges “now urgently need to be followed up by tangible measures”.Andrew McCormick, a senior official from the Northern Ireland civil service, was present at the meeting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/056e89f4217902ea1a711b2cd9b480d4e6ef1bd0/0_80_6220_3732/master/6220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7889b5392a64e76a4aa5e96234b62c2","title":"cholera and coronavirus why we must not repeat the same mistakes","story":"Cholera has largely been beaten in the west, but it still kills tens of thousands of people in poorer countries every year. As we search for a cure for coronavirus, we have to make sure it will be available to everyone, not just to those in wealthy nations. By  Neil SinghWe log in every day at 7.45am. One by one, we join an array of faces on our screens. We doctors aren’t used to video-conferencing like this, and still greet each other with excited waving hands. Since the coronavirus crisis began, these daily virtual meetings have proved an invaluable way to keep up to speed on clinical guidelines, in-house protocols and staff wellbeing – all of which are changing every day.But these meetings also bring us news that we take more personally: how many of our patients have symptoms? How many have tested positive? How many have died? These are important questions, for sure, but my public health training reminds me to think globally. The coming year will see developments that will allow us to bring the virus under control in the west, but what about in other countries? I cannot help but think of my relatives in India, and what this pandemic will mean for them – not just now, but in the future. The really important question is not who will die of coronavirus tomorrow, but in 200 years’ time.For coronavirus is not the only pandemic the world faces. There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away.While I will surely be able to offer my patients in England a coronavirus vaccine in a year or two, and while western health systems will be reinforced to be more ready for a potential future outbreak, I worry that we may repeat the mistakes of cholera: conquering coronavirus everywhere except for the poorest parts of the world.To reach my grandparents’ house in Bihar, in north-east India, you have to take a car from Patna airport across one of the longest river bridges in the world, the Mahatma Gandhi Setu. This bridge takes you north over the river Ganges, past Hajipur, a city famous for its fragrant bananas, and up to Darbhanga, near the border with Nepal. When I was a child, the road was so damaged by the region’s regular floods and monsoons that the journey, which would take just two hours in the UK, took seven hours, bumping over gut-lurching potholes. Today, the road is smooth and elevated, giving a spectacular view of the area’s lush flood plains. They provide the perfect conditions for cultivating the fruits – mangoes, lychees and guava – that still flavour my memories of visits to my grandparents.The wet, semi-tropical conditions in the Ganges delta also make it a hotspot for water-borne diseases. And it is in northern India that cholera is thought to have originated several millennia ago, owing to the abundance of still water pools and Hindu ceremonies involving worshippers washing themselves in rivers. A 2,000-year-old inscription at a temple in Gujarat vividly describes the clinical picture of patients afflicted by severe cholera: “The lips blue, the face haggard, the eyes hollow, the stomach sunk in, the limbs contracted and crumpled as if by fire.”In the 19th century, the scientist Max von Pettenkofer believed, incorrectly, that cholera required certain soils and environmental factors unique to India, and so thought that it could not be contagious or endemic in Europe. But the persistence of cholera in this area has less to do with climate and more to do with political choices.Cholera is an infectious disease that turns on all the taps in your gut, so that water and salts pour out of your system, giving you copious watery diarrhoea that looks starchy, like rice water. This diarrhoea helps the infection spread between people, leaving a trail of victims so severely dehydrated that, if they don’t receive treatment, they shrivel up like prunes within hours.Empire shaped the history of cholera, and it was the economic concerns of imperial powers that brought cholera to heel in the west. But if imperialism was crucial to providing the impetus to end cholera, it also produced a logic that ided the world and only eliminated the disease from one half.In his book Plagues and Peoples, the historian William Hardy McNeill describes how the British army carried cholera overland into Nepal and Afghanistan, while British navy and merchant ships carried it beyond the Indian Ocean. That is how the first pandemic spread from the Bay of Bengal to south-east Asia, the Middle East, east Africa, and then to Europe by the early 1820s.In 1831, cholera reached the north-east of England, the region where I grew up. One of the first victims, in Sunderland, was a 12-year-old girl called Isabella Hazard. Her illness was characteristically swift: she was entirely well one evening and dead the next afternoon. She was an early victim of the first of a series of waves of the disease that caused pandemonium in 19th-century Europe. Port cities, crucial to trade, were affected particularly badly.It is hard to imagine the panic created by the “Blue Death”, as cholera was nicknamed, because at the time its cause was a total mystery. The most common theory – that the disease was associated with “bad airs” (or “miasmas”) – inspired desperate experiments to control it. In Kingston, Jamaica, for instance, British colonial officers tried to banish the disease by firing cannons through the streets “to destroy the morbific power that lurked in the dark alleys”.So cholera went on, unabated, in wave after wave of pandemics throughout the 19th century, causing millions of deaths, mainly in poor neighbourhoods. The working classes rioted across Europe, suspecting the disease was a conspiracy by the ruling elite, who they thought were poisoning them. In the 1830s, the revolutionary Mario Adorno accused the Bourbon royal family of concocting “a devilish plot bent on poisoning the people” of Sicily with cholera, as part of his attempt to topple them.But disasters like pandemics are never just destructive – they also induce change, and often spark scientific developments and social reforms. The European imperial powers eventually started pouring resources into discovering the true cause of the disease, primarily to prevent the catastrophic economic downturns that accompanied every fresh outbreak. This investment led to three major developments that helped end cholera in the western world: reforms that improved public health, to stop populations getting the disease in the first place the discovery of new medicines, to prevent and treat the disease and international cooperation, to unite against a common enemy.In 1813, Frances Snow gave birth to her first child, John, in York. She and her husband, William, who worked at the local coal yard, raised John in one of the poorest parts of the city. Like Bihar in India, the area John grew up in was regularly affected by flooding, when the River Ouse broke its banks.When John became a doctor, he grew sceptical of the idea that cholera was caused by “miasmas”. Instead, he suspected it had something to do with water. He famously proved his theory in 1854, during an outbreak in Soho which killed 616 people. He created a dot map of all the cholera cases in the area and spoke to the families to understand their daily habits, meticulously doing what we would today call contact tracing. He discovered that nearly everyone who had been afflicted used the same water pump on Broad Street. Snow had the handle of the pump removed, making it unusable, which led to a sharp decline in cholera cases in Soho. It was later found that this particular well was shallow and had been contaminated by a nearby cesspit. In one elegant experiment, Snow had unveiled the spectre of cholera, which had haunted him since his childhood: the cause was just plain old dirty water.John Snow’s discovery was the first step towards halting cholera. But as the pandemic continued to ravage Europe, effective medicines were needed to prevent and treat the disease. And those could only be developed once scientists understood how dirty water made us sick.In Florence, a contemporary of Snow’s spent his days with his eye pressed up against the cold brass ring of a microscope that he himself had designed. Filippo Pacini was a professor of pathology and a pioneer in the kingdom of the tiny he had a gift for the new art of microscopy and was naming previously undiscovered parts of the human body when he was only 19. He was convinced that the cause of many medical mysteries, like the ones that afflicted his sisters for most of their lives, could be found through careful observation with this powerful new tool.Pacini recognised that these dots – which he called “vibrios” (commas), because of their shape – must be the cause of cholera. He was the first person to observe for certain what had been speculated for centuries: that diseases could be caused by things too small to see by the naked eye. However, the scientific community failed to appreciate the value of his research, and his findings languished, largely ignored, for another three decades.Pacini had discovered the “germ”, but it was not until the German physician Robert Koch himself discovered the comma bacillus in Egypt in 1883 that germ theory became popularised. During the following century, further research led to two crucial targeted therapies, based on breakthroughs by scientists from the Indian subcontinent shortly after it gained independence. In 1953, Hemanda Nath Chatterjee developed a simple mix of salt and sugar that could be added to water to safely replace the copious fluids lost as diarrhoea. The basic recipe is still used today.Six years later, Sambhu Nath De discovered that cholera released a poisonous toxin, which deserved just as much attention as the bacterium itself. Using modest equipment in a laboratory in Kolkata, he showed that the bacteria were not needed to make people sick. If they were stewed in a soupy culture, then removed – like whole spices – even just the remaining broth was enough to cause life-threatening intestinal damage and give all the symptoms of the disease.These discoveries transformed our understanding of cholera, and how it could be treated. They provided the basis of two new medicines: oral rehydration therapy, to replace lost salts and a cholera vaccine, to induce an immune response against the bacteria and its toxin.Today, it’s easy for westerners to get their hands on the most effective vaccine, Dukoral. Using it simply involves adding a vial of the liquid vaccine to water, together with a sachet of a granulated buffer that protects the vaccine from stomach acid. It’s no harder than adding milk and sugar to tea. Two doses will induce an antibody response that will protect you for about five years. But Dukoral cannot be used in the areas where cholera is most prevalent, because they don’t have access to clean water, so taking the medicine could actually put people at risk. Besides, it is unaffordable in those places to earn enough to pay for two doses, the average Briton would have to work for less than an hour, while the average Indian farmer would have to work for three whole days.There are other, cheaper cholera vaccines, such as Shanchol, which is manufactured by Shantha Biotechnics in India. This has the advantage of not needing any extra water, as it is poured directly into the mouth. But it is not as effective as Dukoral, as it does not protect you against the toxin, just the bacteria. Plus, it still requires two doses given two weeks apart. That’s hardly feasible for healthcare workers trying to cover vast areas of rural India.There are many other obstacles to cholera vaccination programmes. To be effective, they must reach enough of the population to achieve herd immunity. This requires accurate surveillance, which is impossible without a strong and centralised public health system. Like the other countries where cholera is still endemic, India lacks this infrastructure, largely owing to the long shadow of colonial extraction, post-colonial debt, and loans granted by the IMF and the World Bank in the 1990s on the condition that the government reduce its spending, which led to cuts to public health and education programmes – the very things that a society needs to haul itself out of the conditions that stoke cholera.So although the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of the cholera vaccine in areas where cholera is endemic, and despite the existence of an easy-to-use vaccine which is manufactured in their own country, my relatives in their remote village in Bihar have not had it. But if I, as a westerner, want to visit them for a week, I can easily get it in the UK.Oral rehydration therapy and the cholera vaccine have greatly reduced cholera’s reach in subsequent decades, but it has not gone away completely. Two years after Sambu Nath De’s seminal research, a new pandemic – the seventh – sprung up in Indonesia and took hold in Asia and north Africa. This pandemic is still ongoing. More than a billion people live in countries at risk of the disease which, by no coincidence, are some of the poorest countries on earth.In the two decades after cholera first reached Europe, inidual European nations, acting in isolation, tried in vain to prevent and contain it. But there was no point cleaning up port cities at great expense when you could not vouch for the sailors and cargo flowing through it. They eventually realised that a problem caused by globalisation required an international solution.This led to the first example of global cooperation in order to combat a disease. In 1851, the first International Sanitary Conference, convening the major European imperial powers, was held in Paris. Still, it took time for all those gathered to reach a consensus, and the first International Sanitary Conventions were not adopted until 1892.According to Anne-Emanuelle Birn, a professor at the University of Toronto School of Public Health, trade was the driving motive of these meetings, and public health just a necessary means. They proved successful: transnational interventions, such as quarantine and disease surveillance by international health bureaux, did bring down cholera deaths. These International Sanitary Conferences proved the power of international cooperation to improve health and boost the economy, and provided the blueprint for the Health Organization of the League of Nations, and later the WHO.Perhaps the greatest achievement of this cooperation came in 1979, when smallpox was eradicated globally. But unlike smallpox, cholera has not been eradicated – not because of some insurmountable biological hurdle, but because we have thrown our weight behind schemes that focus solely on cholera, rather than trying to end the poverty that makes such diseases likely. There are still about 3 million cases and 100,000 deaths from cholera every year, all entirely preventable. Based on recent estimates, from 1 January to 25 March of this year, cholera claimed more lives than the coronavirus. But we are saying so much about coronavirus and so little about cholera because coronavirus has broken the unwritten rule that dangerous infections should not befall those in the west.A map of the places still struggling with cholera shows 47 countries – in Central America, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. This might seem to confirm that tropical countries are bound to nurture this bacteria, because of their warm climates and high population density. But the experience of the Marshall Islands, a remote Pacific archipelago that suffered a cholera outbreak at the end of 2000 and start of 2001, shows that there is nothing inevitable about where the disease takes its toll. As the University of Hawaii researchers Seiji Yamada and Wesley Palmer have shown, two neighbouring islands there experienced very different fates – despite having similar climates and being just four miles apart.The US maintains a military base on Kwajalein Island, where the menial labour is carried out by low-paid workers who live on another nearby island, Ebeye. Many of them are descended from refugees from other islands in the archipelago who were displaced by US weapons testing in the 40s and 50s. The housing and infrastructure provided to them on Ebeye by the military is not much better than a slum. The average household is home to nine people, so infections spread rapidly. The sewers pour their contents into lagoons where people swim and fish, and when it rains they overflow into the streets.At the time of the outbreak, there was no running water on Ebeye. Furthermore, since the land there was not fit for agriculture, traditional Marshallese ingredients were unavailable, and nearly all food was imported, unhealthy and expensive, leaving many malnourished. It was a ship bringing food to the island that is thought to have started the outbreak of 2000-2001.On Kwajalein Island, meanwhile, the residents are almost exclusively American expats who work for private military contractors. They live in detached villas with amenities like those of a beach resort, and the population density is 20 times less than that on Ebeye. Once the outbreak had begun, workers were only allowed to commute from Ebeye to Kwajalein if they could prove that they had received vaccination or prophylactic antibiotics. During the cholera outbreak, there were 400 cases and six deaths on Ebeye. However, on Kwajalein there was not a single case.What made contracting cholera so likely on Ebeye and so unlikely on Kwajalein has nothing to do with climate or geography. There is no biological or environmental reason why cholera cannot be eradicated for good in Ebeye, and Bihar, and right across the world. It is not the knowhow that is lacking, but rather the political will to extend these benefits to all people.It is now 200 years since the cholera pandemics began, more than 150 years since the bacteria was identified, and 60 years since an inexpensive treatment and vaccination regime was developed. And yet still this contagion is plaguing some countries as if none of that progress had ever happened. That is the real lesson of cholera.There are fears that coronavirus is now distributed so widely that, like cholera, it may be here for the long haul. It is not yet known whether this current coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, will eventually mutate to cause milder, cold-like symptoms, like the four endemic coronaviruses or instead go the way of the first Sars coronavirus and remain as a deadly, but contained, infection. In either scenario, Sars-CoV-2 or a similar future virus could, like cholera, be eliminated only from the richer parts of the world, and left to circulate, with deadly consequences, in the world’s poorest regions.The world will eventually recover a semblance of normality by adopting the same three techniques we used against cholera: prevention of transmission, targeted treatments and global cooperation between nations. But as we saw with cholera, all three strategies can exacerbate global ides, if they are applied selectively to protect only the richer half of the world.There are signs that this is happening already: from richer countries buying up so much extra personal protective equipment that poor countries will be unable to obtain or afford enough to protect their health workers to the outsourcing of coronavirus clinical trials to poor countries, like India, that will be less able to afford the vaccine once it is developed to poor countries becoming blind spots in the world’s gaze on coronavirus, because they lack the digital infrastructure necessary to collect comprehensive data about their outbreaks.Just as cholera gave birth to global health, coronavirus should trigger its latest reboot. Richard Smith, the former editor of the BMJ, has compared the stages of global health since the first cholera pandemics to the updates of an operating system. I welcome what he calls “Global Health 4.0”: namely, research and policy led by researchers and activists from poor countries. And while the WHO has not always lived up to its lofty goals, nor managed to achieve eradication of cholera as it did for smallpox, the solution is not to weaken it, as per Donald Trump’s removal of funding, but the opposite: it needs much more funding, and more independence from corporate donors, if it is to help tackle the socio-economic conditions that make us sick.Besides the basic moral argument for a system of public health and international cooperation that benefits all people, it is also in everyone’s interests, because as long as infections blight poor countries, they will continue to pose a threat to the west, too. The Nigerian global health scholar Obijiofor Aginam has written that “enormous sacrifices must then be made by the developed world to confront mutual vulnerability”. Coronavirus has reminded us, once again, of this mutual vulnerability.To prevent further pandemics, Aginam calls for a “communitarian globalism”: a bottom-up approach, “based on ideals of fairness, justice, and equitable distribution of scarce but moderate global resources”. We have already seen glimpses of this kind of solidarity in the current crisis: from the communist government in Kerala giving food and shelter to migrant workers to the Somalian doctors offering their help in crisis zones such as Italy to Cuba allowing an infected British cruise ship to dock to receive timely medical care by its doctors.There are, of course, important differences between coronavirus and cholera. The fact that coronavirus has a higher transmission rate than cholera, for instance, will make curbing its spread particularly challenging. But the lesson from cholera holds nonetheless. If we allow global health to be funded and governed by the old colonial logic that is embedded in its current structures, then the story will play out as it did for cholera.For now, I will continue to worry about my patients and colleagues in England, and how many of them will succumb to this virus. But while there are certainly better and worse ways to respond to the crisis here in the short term, history will judge us not just on who dies from coronavirus today, but in the centuries to come.For when my patients die during a pandemic in one of the richest countries in the world, it is of course a tragedy, but I can take comfort in the fact that it is an exceptional one, and that every effort is being made to prevent further such deaths. A much bigger moral failing would be if there are still people in the poorest parts of the earth dying of coronavirus in 2200. In 50 years’ time, when I take the road north through Bihar to my ancestral home, I hope I will be able to buy a bunch of bananas in Hajipur without wearing a mask, and fill my nostrils with their sweetness.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/600cac3a55507f9f8596e45ae465624c782e7d07/0_227_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d3712d7c98f3aac98f0c070d73571d55","title":"sixers lakers 2001 nba finals","story":"No athlete has ever embodied my hometown’s underdog spirit more entirely than AI on the night he led the Sixers to a famous upset of the seemingly invincible LakersThe 2001 Philadelphia 76ers are a tall tale that only grows unlikelier with time. The premise flatly stated is absurd: the Sixers built a ballclub around a 5ft 11in delinquent from Virginia Beach and it worked. Allen Iverson became the least conventional star ever to lead a team to the NBA finals and the Sixers became the ultimate underdog squad for the ultimate underdog city.From almost the day he arrived in my hometown aged 20, Iverson was plainly one of the NBA’s most transcendent talents, whose scoring instinct was amplified by a new-generation, kill-your-idols edge. His was the perfect game for the teenagers we were: reckless, almost violent, crackling with anarchic energy. It quickly became the greatest show in sports and it was happening right in our backyard. AI was just cool as shit. The whole city loved him. He was a singular but flawed talisman: who could win games by himself but refused to lift or do any real treatment, blew off practice because he was hungover, cursed out the coach and all but begged to be kicked off the team.Yet Iverson’s preposterous feats of bravery – watching him throw his 160lb frame into the paint, carom off the elbows of linebacker-sized defenders, score a bucket and then bounce off the deck to do it again – were his nightly penance and absolution for more than a decade. If clean-cut superstars like Jordan and Kobe strived to embody the (false) ideal of perfection, Iverson unapologetically spoke to the frailties innate in us. He was beloved because he was fallible.No team before or since has ever made a player that little the focal point and understandably so deep down we knew the blueprint was doomed. But in 2001, it all came together. The concept was simple: the Sixers surrounded Iverson with selfless role players who wouldn’t get pissed the smallest guy on the court was chucking up 30 shots a night, their names familiar only because most were on their third or fourth team.The Sixers were given no chance in the finals against the seemingly invincible Los Angeles Lakers, the in-form defending champions led by Shaq and Kobe who hadn’t lost in more than two months. Even at full strength Philadelphia would have had their hands full, but the depleted Mash unit that arrived at the Staples Center for Game 1 of the series was written off entirely.The Lakers immediately showed why, rattling off 16 unanswered points behind the most physically fearsome big man in NBA history at his elemental peak. But after a patchy start Iverson caught fire, slashing and careening to the goal in transition, effortlessly shedding his perimeter defenders out of half-court sets and silencing the Hollywood plastics at courtside. By intermission he’d poured in 30, five off Jordan’s finals record for points in a half, as the Sixers built a lead that would swell to 73-58 in the third quarter.After watching Iverson shred Kobe and Derek Fisher for the first half hour, the Lakers looked way down the bench to Tyronn Lue, the seldom-used point guard who had spent the run-up mimicking Iverson against the Lakers’ first team in practice. Lue harried and hounded Philadelphia’s star relentlessly, denying him the ball or forcing him into contested jumpers. Whether borne from tactical genius or desperation, it was working.With Iverson in check, Shaq at his unstoppable best and my entire city hanging on every loose ball and rebound, the Lakers chipped away and sent the game to overtime. Then comes the part everyone remembers.The Sixers are clinging to a two-point lead with about a minute to go when Iverson receives a pass near the corner. He hesitates a half-beat, as if to assess his prey, before crossing over Lue and lofting a stepback jumper that hangs in the air for what seems like ages before ripping through the net, punctuating the coup de grâce with an exaggerated high-step over his fallen foil. Forty-eight points, five rebounds, six assists and five steals. Sixers take Game 1, 107-101.It was the apotheosis of the Iverson era and a Whitmanian triumph of the inidual, a moment that struck so far beyond sports into the essence of our city’s insurgent soul, validating everything Philadelphia embodies and fiercely protected in our Allen: uncompromising, defiant, self-certain to a fault with a taste for the fight. The better team won over the best-of-seven series, as happens in basketball, but Iverson’s Game 1 masterclass has come to transcend the outcome in NBA history and define his place in the basketball pantheon: the greatest pound for pound to ever do it and a hell of a player."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/206dfd5e5c4ea726739548450ba8f0dc4984fe11/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=11e4752d330c32604f77f35b1ff0f64c","title":"parks and rec reunion episode amy poehler","story":"The cast of the long-running sitcom reassembled for a special that avoided political statements and gave fans what they were cravingArt conceived in the name of charity does not have the strongest track record those with a mind for cultural ephemera wince at the memory of such fundraising musical singles as We Are the World and Do They Know It’s Christmas?. Though these projects may have been organized under the objective of providing aid at a time of desperate need, their maudlin self-satisfaction could not stand up to scrutiny under the usual rubrics used to critique any other release. And so this was the specific strain of dread that Parks and Recreation fans brought to the news of a reunion episode hastily coordinated in order to put together donations for Feeding America, a nonprofit funding a vast network of pantries, soup kitchens and other community-based centers. A show that often lapsed into corniness in its later years seemed primed to return drenched in high-fructose corn syrup with an extra-hefty helping of creamed corn on the side.Add to that the larger political incongruence of a distinctly Obama-era relic reviving itself in the festering dystopia of Trumpism, and the stage was set for a decently-intended minor debacle. What a relief, then, that this “episode” (a term here used loosely to refer to a collection of stitched-together self-taped dialogues recorded from the cast’s respective quarantines) should turn out to be nothing more than it has to – a collection of timely jokes that connect more often than they don’t, reacquainting us in a low-stakes manner with the characters fans have been missing. Things may have changed, faces have developed a few new lines, but the writing staff understands that ultimately it’s just nice to have the gang back together. They let the ensemble bounce off each other without letting external factors get in the way.Most significantly, the reunion episode sheds the political conscience that wedged the regular series into the zeitgeist during the previous presidential administration. A sunny can-do liberalism became Leslie Knope and co’s calling card, an attitude that could not possibly be more out of joint in light of America’s slide into soft fascism and the utter failure of the Democratic party to halt it in any meaningful way. The notion of a cameo from Knope favorite Joe Biden, currently the subject of much discussion regarding accusations of sexual assault, was enough to turn any registered voter’s stomach. Mercifully, the show conceived as “a comedy version of The West Wing” now comes to us from a world without Bidens or Clintons or Trumps, its comedy unsullied by commentary at a time when we all just need a laugh.And so the joke writers do what they do best, and get back to writing jokes. We start with a celebrity pop-in of the welcome variety, with Paul Rudd reprising pampered heir Bobby Newport at his family’s private fox-hunting estate in Switzerland, where he “hasn’t caught any yet – they’re so fast, like zoop! And they’re gone!” After warning of the dangers related to “the coronus”, he turns it over to our pals from Pawnee, who are of course all taking the proper precautions. Their inidual check-ins form the logical extension of those “what would X-sitcom’s characters be doing under quarantine?” articles, giving each character a moment fitting what we know about them to our new status quo.Adam Scott’s Ben Wyatt has combined his two great passions by writing a script for a Cones of Dunshire claymation movie, as “punishingly dense” as the board game inspiring it. He’s isolating separately from wife Leslie, who makes the most pointed comment while mentioning that it was “sad, but necessary” that she had to shut down every national park. She’s done her part by starting a bunch of committees and organizing a phone tree, which gives structure to this series of video calls conducted under the in-universe platform of Gryzzl. Once viewers get acclimated to the disjointed comic pacing that results from no two actors sharing the same space, it’s harmless fun.It’s like visiting your hometown to find everything right where you left it, a bit sweet and a bit sad. Nick Offerman’s Ron Swanson still loves meat, and gets one of the biggest laughs by reminding us of the hysterical matrimonial dynamic at play in the Offerman-Mullally household. As wannabe baller Tom Haverford, Aziz Ansari still fixates on seeming with it, name-checking Fortnite and using background filters to place himself in a faux Bali. Dedicated nurse Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) is on the frontlines, and must quarantine in a “different part of the house” from her husband, Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe), as he donates blood four times each day.Retta’s ever-elegant Donna Meagle situates herself in front of a wall of chromatically arranged sneakers. Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt, their careers having risen most precipitously in the years since the finale, get the least to do. We learn that the Luddgate-Dwyer household has a drum set, but most importantly, Pratt leads the stirring sing-along of Bye Bye, Li’l Sebastian that takes us out. It’s an easy way to conclude with something momentous and cathartic, and yet far from the worst-case scenario as to how this could’ve all gone.The episode succeeds by allowing itself to be little more than a half-hour of humor. It’s never better than when crafting great setups and punchlines for the tertiary faces making quick appearances. (Boozy newswoman Joan Calamezzo has an EGOT because she has been kicked out of all four major awards ceremonies cologne magnate Dennis Feinstein markets a scent called Miracle Cure fan-beloved Jean-Ralphio claims to have been “banned from Cameo” for recording his videos naked.) By that same tack, the weakest moment comes when the episode adopts an about-face for the lines: “Things will go back to normal. They just have to.” Most Americans have made their peace with the fact that things will most definitely not snap back to normal when this all ends, and that by no means do they “have to.” In a lesser world, the episode would have been ripe with hollow feel-good platitudes like that one, but someone knew better. As Preston Sturges teaches us by the conclusion of Sullivan’s Travels, people living in times of hardship don’t need to be preached to. We just need a break from all the damned stress, and Pawnee’s finest happily obliged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We want to hear from those who attended mega-events such as Cheltenham Festival and the Stereophonics concerts in CardiffWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead during the week beginning 9 March.Those events include: the Cheltenham Festival, the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie, and the Stereophonics concerts in Cardiff.Do you believe that you were infected by coronavirus by attending one of these events?You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.At the start of the coronavirus epidemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means that each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would each pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends both on the biology of the virus, but also our behaviour, such as social distancing. It also depends on the population’s immunity. At the start of an outbreak scientists often refer to the “basic reproductive number”, R0, which is a similar measure to R, but starts with the premise that the population has zero immunity through infection or vaccination.Under the current lockdown restrictions, R is now estimated to have dropped to somewhere between 0.6 and 0.9. This means that the epidemic is shrinking – although not uniformly. The figure given for London is 0.5 to 0.7, with some parts of the UK having a higher or lower figure.There is no obvious answer for what R needs to be in order for the lockdown to be lifted. That depends on how low ministers want the total number of cases to be if the government is to be able to effectively track and trace new cases. It is also not clear precisely how easing different restrictions will influence R – there is still uncertainty about how much schools contribute to transmission, for instance. So real-time tracking of transmission will be needed to continue providing a rolling estimate.Because once R inches above 1, even just a fraction, the number of cases will start sharply rising again, putting the UK on the path to a substantial second surge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65250bcc48b8e6ba30bd289b420de33caab7319b/180_0_3635_2182/master/3635.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=275485a58064b30e2f5cd3431be965f9","title":"beyond lockdown covid coronavirus good news 19","story":"The Upside weekly newsletter on lessons of the pandemic and what might outlast Covid-19 Ten years ago I did three months of self-isolation.

Doing a total of eight miles after meals has dramatically reduced the post-prandial glucose spikes, measured by my 14-day flash glucose monitor.

Photographs of the event, proudly published in local state media, showed residents in festive red and yellow bibs digging in, reaching with their chopsticks for hundreds of dishes laid out on banquet tables.Five days later, the city was placed under lockdown and within weeks, there were several possible coronavirus infections in the neighbourhood. For months to come that banquet would be cited as an example of how little local officials had done to prevent the virus from spreading across their city.In the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, Chinese authorities are pushing for a “dining table revolution” to change long-held traditions of communal eating like those on display at the Baibuting meal, where diners take from shared plates with their own chopsticks.Authorities have launched an aggressive campaign to convince diners to use designated serving utensils known as gongkuai or gongshao, or “public chopsticks” and “public spoon”. Officials are also encouraging the serving of separate portions rather than “family style”, where a group shares several dishes.It will be a difficult feat to pull off. After the 2002-03 Sars epidemic, a similar initiative petered out. More challenging is that sharing food is a key part of Chinese social life and a sign of intimacy.The gongkuai – more common in Japan, Korea or Taiwan – tend to be seen at higher-end restaurants in China and rarely used at home. Among family or friends, asking for the serving utensils can be awkward or perceived as rude.“The obstacle is the traditional notion that we have to drink together and eat together and not show any distance,” said Q Edward Wang, the author of Chopsticks: A Cultural and Culinary History. “That kind of notion is well-entrenched in Chinese society as well as around the world,” he said.Under chopstick etiquette, taught at an early age, one should touch only the food one intends to eat. But Chinese health officials say the practice leaves too much opportunity for germs to be passed through saliva from one’s own set of utensils to the shared dishes.Across the country, celebrities, business tycoons, public health experts, and teams of propaganda workers have been deployed to educate the public. “Divide meals, not love,” state media have declared.In Ningxia in north-west China, a video tutorial by local state media tells residents in local dialect of a “new trend in civilised dining”.“Dividing meals and chopsticks is not iding love,” it assures viewers. In Hangzhou, a local party member has called for 11 November to be designated “People’s Chopsticks Action Day,” given the date’s similarity to two sets of chopsticks.In Beijing, billboards call for citizens to join the campaign under the tagline: “Love is one more pair of chopsticks.” Starting in June, restaurants will be required to provide serving utensils and when possible to offer separate portions.At Huajia Yiyuan, a chain known for its Beijing roast duck, each place setting has two pairs of chopsticks and two spoons. At a popular hotpot restaurant on Beijing’s Ghost Street, all tables come with a set of the serving utensils. “Customers are very willing to use them,” said Lan Luoshi, 20, who works there. “If I go out with friends to eat or for hotpot, I will definitely use gongkuai,” she said.Changing habits at home and among the older generation may be harder. A common scene at family dinners involves relatives using their own chopsticks to put food on the plates of younger members of the family. Younger family members serve food to their older relatives as a sign of respect, while couples get food for each other in a show of affection.Many do not regard using the designated serving utensils as necessary at home. In a recent online poll by Sina Shanghai, half of more than 650 respondents said they would not use gongkuai or gongshao at home, agreeing with the response: “I won’t. We are all one family.”Chinese eating culture may be changing in other ways, away from crowded, bustling restaurants to quieter affairs. Many restaurants limit the size of dining parties to two and place tables at least 1 metre apart.Shi, 50, a chef at a noodle shop in a mall in Beijing’s Chaoyang district says he and his wife now rarely invite friends over. He recently noticed a group of co-workers come into his restaurant and naturally split into smaller groups, eating at separate tables.“The epidemic has already changed big things,” he said. During lunar new year in late January, authorities called on residents not to visit families, a key tradition for the holiday. “If the outbreak can change that, changing how we use chopsticks is nothing,” he said.According to Wang, it took hundreds of years for chopsticks to become the staple utensil. Changing modern eating habits, while difficult, should not take as long. “Customs are much more powerful than policy,” he said.“The pandemic and the government directives will provide some impetus. Gradually people will become more adjusted to the idea that even if we don’t share food, we are still friends.”Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67e5b503e665373ec1ce3993afb1b7b16880f9c4/0_33_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84c62b2c550225f3ec7fad6507d6bf4a","title":"hes just a wonderful man how captain tom became a superstar fundraiser","story":"The public’s huge response to the 100-year-old, who has raised £32m for the NHS, shows how much it needs some good news When Captain Tom Moore set out with his walking frame at the start of April he had a modest goal: to raise £1,000 for the NHS by walking up and down his garden 100 times before his 100th birthday. One of his daughters, Hannah Ingram-Moore, thought it might make a nice little story for the local media, and so on 7 April her consultancy firm, Maytrix, knocked up a press release heralding his mission.The release included a photograph of the then 99-year-old wearing a navy blue fleece, pushing a walking frame on which was balanced a panama hat and his stick. “We are all being rightly advised to stay home, stay safe and protect our NHS, and that is exactly what local 99-year-old Tom Moore is doing,” the copy began – and, with it, one of the most startlingly successful fundraising stories of our time.How exactly a centenarian managed to capture a nation’s heart – prompting an RAF fly-by, an upgrade in military rank and Piers Morgan pledging ten grand of his own money, not to mention an array of conspiracy theories – is a tale that proves both the ongoing power of the mainstream media and the British public’s hunger for joy during a time of bleak national crisis.The global media onslaught began in Milton Keynes, where the press release caught the eye of Damien Lucas, head of news for a group of local newspapers. Within a few hours the story was on Bedford Today, with a headline about the ambitions of a “Bedford man” and his 100th birthday challenge, inspired by the treatment he received from the NHS after breaking his hip and for skin cancer.A local ITV report followed and by 10 April, Good Friday, Captain Tom was live on BBC Breakfast. “You have lived, and you have seen some tough times in this country, can you inspire people who are watching now, just reassure them, it will be fine?” asked Naga Munchetty. “Remember,” he said, “tomorrow is a good day, tomorrow you will maybe find everything will be much better than today.”A star was born. The BBC Breakfast team watched, staggered, as donations to Captain Tom’s Just Giving Page went from £1,000 to a million and beyond. Before long, their rivals on Good Morning Britain had picked up the story, with Piers Morgan pledging £10,000 of his own money.Back in Marston Moretaine, a small village 12 miles from Milton Keynes, journalists and well-wishers began congregating outside the house Captain Tom shares with Hannah and her family, hoping to catch a glimpse of their hero doing his laps.On 16 April Moore finished his challenge live on BBC Breakfast surrounded by a guard of honour from the 1st Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment. By 20 April he had raised over £20m and had recorded a duet with Michael Ball that was on its way to number one in the charts.The family began to worry about crowds outside the house. A neighbour got a number for DIY SOS presenter Nick Knowles to see if he could help. Hannah, a huge DIY SOS fan, texted asking if this was really Nick Knowles. He suggested a Facetime call to prove his identity and soon had arranged for a fence to be put up outside the family garden, according to Megan Carver, Knowles’s longtime PR.Carver came on board last week to help field inquiries for free. One of her first calls was to Schillings, the notorious London libel firm, famed for its sky-high fees and celebrity clientele. “It was probably the easiest phone call I’ve ever made,” said Carver. “I explained that Captain Tom’s family needed a bit of help and Schillings immediately said, yes, and of course this will be pro bono.”Schillings contacted Ipso, the press regulator, to ask journalists to stop “either leaning over the fence or placing their long-focus-lens cameras through hedges to take intrusive photographs”, noting that the family had set up a Twitter account, @captaintommoore containing images that could be used for free.Back at the village, the family could no longer cope with the deluge of cards and presents arriving from around the world. Bill Chandi, the local postmaster, stepped in to help, offering his post office as their correspondence address. “Since then I have been working 247 and it is my honour to do so,” said Chandi.Bedford school, where Captain Tom’s grandson Benji is a pupil, offered its school hall to house the cards. By Thursday they were spilling out into the classrooms too. “He’s already received at least 160,000 cards,” said Chandi. “Quite a few people want to make sure they definitely get to the right place so they send them recorded delivery, which means we have to log them all in the post office – we don’t sign for them because of social distancing.” The local sorting office has had to set up a separate “Captain Tom” team with two or three dedicated workers, he added.On Thursday, Captain Tom became Colonel Tom, promoted to an honorary role by the British Army. Boris Johnson wished him happy birthday, the Queen sent her customary telegram and a wartime Spitfire and Hurricane flew over Marston Moretaine.He has been the perfect hero for our times, says BBC Breakfast editor Richard Frediani. “There’s nothing self-centred or grandiose about Captain Tom. He’s just a wonderful man. You can tell it has hit a nerve with viewers when they are looking for something to rally around. He brings a little bit of good news and light into what are very difficult times.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fa524691be3e206c89ace0698932b0c2e17b12c/0_0_5536_3322/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c60f065762d3d74dc71b6a1b19f2d3d1","title":"was britain unprepared for a pandemic podcast","story":"As medics and carers report widespread shortages of protective equipment, the government is facing pressure to explain why it appears the UK went into a pandemic under-resourced.

The policy is widely supported by the public, even though the Swedish Covid-19 mortality rate is among the 10 highest in the world, at 240 per million population and steadily rising, and many of the nursing homes in Stockholm are now affected.The typical explanation for this continued public support is that Swedes are trusting and unflappable. The country’s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, the public face of the Swedish response to the pandemic, is after all a dry scientist-turned-bureaucrat, not some populist politician trying to whip up nationalist go-it-alone emotion.But beneath the surface, Sweden is anything but calm. The public debate is inflamed with a sense of wounded national pride. As a believer in the kind of liberal nationalism that encourages self-critical national attachment, this pains me. But as a scholar of nationalism, I recognise the pattern. This is what Isaiah Berlin called the nationalism of “the bent twig”, which lashes out against anyone who steps on it.It began with a self-conceit that seemed more comical than harmful. Why, one columnist asked, could we not just “let Sweden be Sweden”? Others suggested we brand ourselves “smart Sweden” or “kind Sweden”, the country immune to the hysteria of southern Europe.The next step was the ridicule and delegitimisation of opponents. A group of 22 scientists wrote a joint opinion column arguing for a drastic change of strategy. But within a few hours no one was paying attention to the substance of their arguments. Instead the debate came to revolve entirely around the fact that they used Covid-19 death numbers that made Sweden look worse than the more cautious estimates of the public health agency. This was certainly clumsy, but did not undermine their main conclusion. Nor does the fact that Sweden does indeed now have close to six times more deaths per capita than neighbouring Norway or Finland.Then came contempt for emotions, mixed with misogyny. Lena Einhorn, one of the 22 critics, was interviewed via videolink from her home. She broached research reports and numbers, but influential columnists focused on making fun of her hair or curtains. Her “hysterical” voice when describing the suffering of Covid-19 patients was also widely mocked. The detached response to her by chief epidemiologist Tegnell was hailed as evidence of his credibility. It is true that he speaks clinically about death in terms of statistical curves. But it is equally true that he did not offer much rebuttal of the research reports she quoted.From this trope of Sweden being alone in doing it right, we seem now to have shifted to denying that Sweden is doing anything exceptional at all. An opinion piece by a political scientist suggested that the  had “blacklisted” Sweden, and that its reporting had described Sweden as “free from restrictions”. “Who would have thought Trump’s fake news would one day turn out to be somewhat real?” he concluded.But these claims are themselves untrue.  among others rightly reported the comparatively mild restrictions in Sweden. Nor was it “fake news” when Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that Swedish doctors could soon be denying respirators to patients over the age of 80, and even those as young as 60 with underlying health conditions. In fact, this is now taking place.Some failures of the Swedish model have been acknowledged. But they are often linked to the lack of “compliance” of immigrants. Former chief epidemiologist Johan Giesecke explains the failure to protect the elderly in nursing homes with reference to “asylum seekers” and “refugees” on the staff, who “may not always be understanding the information”. This has met with silence, if not approval. It may already have been picked up by the Sweden Democrats, Sweden’s anti-immigration party, who now claim the health of elderly people has been put at risk for the sake of integrating uneducated immigrants.Defenders of the government’s strategy keep repeating that it is too early to evaluate it. But carrying that argument through to its logical conclusion suggests that veneration should also be postponed until the pandemic has passed. Any successful strategy should be transparent and welcome public scrutiny. My fear is that in our vehement defence of the Swedish approach, we have released forces we cannot control. As is clear for anyone who has followed Brexit, a nationalism unable to handle criticism can easily tear a society apart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8bdabb34cdcea8231eee7be3ed8c87b7cf3e170/298_0_3314_1989/master/3314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=802b04c542341987a684c6f33c532f27","title":"may day workers confronting coronavirus around the world in pictures","story":"A celebration of the cleaners, transport workers, shop assistants, tradespeople, health workers and more who continue to serve despite the difficulties and risks of the pandemic"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

With the passage of time moments in history are captured and frozen in language forever.In the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, that language is taking root literally as we speak. “Flatten the curve” and “social distancing” quickly established themselves as early phrases, anchoring an event in history.Over the weeks and months, as the crisis developed and came to impact day-to-day life in more profound ways, it has taken over everything from how we behave to how we converse. More and more words and phrases became a central part of our vernacular as we struggled to process our new reality.“Lockdown”, “cocooning”, “isolation” - daily conversations enforced our new vocabulary.Members of the Government and public health experts have been increasingly reliant on such language to drive home the importance of curtailing the spread of the virus. Their use of this language, the media’s reporting of their comments, and society’s repetition of it are all conspiring to cement it into our popular understanding.Here, The  has attempted to capture the frequency with which we have embraced certain words and phrases, at least in our reporting of the pandemic and its effects on Irish and global life.Our data runs from the beginning of the year to April 29th and uses a simple graph to present how often a word has appeared in print on any one day.

It found that 636 more deaths - 365 laboratory-confirmed and 221 probable - occurred in residential care facilities between March 23rd and April 19th this year compared with the same four-week period last year, amid a total of 3,365 deaths.The deaths rate in these facilities has more than doubled compared to the same period last year as a result of Covid-19.The results of the mortality census were presented at last Wednesday’s briefing by NPHET, at which officials were questioned about a media report that cases had occurred before February 29th.Officials said they were unaware of the report but added there was a high level of suspicion about the illness even before a confirmed case was reported.The information about the date cases occurred is contained on a slide presented at the briefing, released online on Friday."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Six weeks ago the zoo closed its doors to all but a core team of socially distancing zookeepers working in strictly controlled groupsKathleen Lynch, who is 90 today, has raised money for Age Action and Irish Red CrossLong-term residential centre had 1st case in mid-February, census of cases showsWRC says dismissal after 2018 incident was \u0026lsquofair and reasonable\u0026rsquoDrugs discovered hidden in poster tubes destined for several addresses in capital analysis shows frequency with which certain words have been embraced sinec JanuaryFigures show grocery spend on March 12th outweighed busiest Christmas shopping dayWorkers with tax-saver tickets may be given refund or be entitled to free public transportMan faces risk of falls and there are concerns over how some of his adult children interact with him, court toldNearly 400 deaths in North involved coronavirus, statistics agency figures showMark Nash denied murders of two women in GrangegormanWhat restrictions will be lifted first?

Photograph: Jason CairnduffReuters Current restrictions introduced to deal with Covid-19 are expected to largely remain in place for a number of weeks, past their initial May 5th expiry date.Cabinet is to meet at 3pm today to sign off on the exit plan from the lockdown with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar calling it a “road map to reopen Ireland”.Mr Varadkar identified five criteria for future decision making on the easing of restrictions including: the progress of Covid-19 healthcare capacity and resilience testing and contact tracing capacity the ability to shield at risk groups and the risk of secondary morbidity.Another 43 deaths from Covid-19 were announced on Thursday, bringing the total number of deaths here to 1,232, according to the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). Another 359 cases were confirmed, bringing the total diagnosed cases to 20,612.The phasesThe  understands the early stages of plans being discussed by the NPHET would see retailers, cafes and restaurants reopen on a limited basis, with the tourist industry also reopening on a limited basis in the mid-stages. Schools and colleges are not expected to reopen until September.NPHET is the body of medical experts and health service chiefs which has been overseeing the response to Covid-19 and advising the Government on steps it should take to navigate through the current coronavirus pandemic.The stages are broken down as: initial phase, early phase stage one, early phase stage two, middle phases and late phases. The latter two phases could be broken down into more stages.Initial drafts of the NPHET plan spaced the phases out in periods between early May and September, although no dates are on the latest draft being considered by NPHET.Under the latest draft the first phase would:- Allow the over-70s who are cocooning out to walk on a “no touch” basis and see them potentially allowed go to the shops at certain times. Sources previously suggesting others may be asked to stay at home while “cocooners” are out.-Allow outdoor workers such as builders and gardeners return to work.- Allow a maximum of four people not from the same household gather outside while obeying social distancing.-Recommence some restricted classes for Leaving Cert students.- Potentially increase the distance people can travel outside their home for exercise from 2km to 5km or 10km.-Businesses and manufacturing are expected to open in the early stages of the plan if they adhere to social distancing and health rules.- Allow retailers such as DIY and garden centres reopen.- Allow retail outlets deemed essential in an earlier round of restrictions – such as banks, repair shops, optometrists and others – open again.The broadening of family units is not seen as likely in the first phase. Other measures – such as the number of people allowed gather together – are also expected to be scaled up throughout the phases.Early phase stage one: would allow small retailers reopen by allowing only a limited number of staff and customers on the premises. - Restrictions on travel away from the home could increase to 20km.-Open marts could recommence.-Outdoor walks and parks where people are not stationary, are moving and can respect social distancing would reopen.Early stage phase two: would see cafes and restaurants reopen, as long as social distancing and strict cleaning rules apply.\u0026nbspPlaygrounds would open.The so-called “middle phases” would see the tourism industry – hotels, hostels, caravan parks – reopen on a limited occupancy basis.- Travel restrictions would be further eased to allow people travel outside their regions. Any holidays or breaks should be taken by family units only.-Creches would open for the children of essential workers.-Hairdressers would open. It is understood that this would be possible only where protective equipment is available.The “later phases” would see the wider reopening of the economy – such as pubs and offices – again if social distancing is implemented.- Creches for children of non-essential workers would open on a staged basis – such as one day a week from the start.-Mass gatherings of over 5,000 people have already been effectively cancelled until September.Guidance around these events is unlikely to be provided until much later in the year, similar to family events such as weddings.-Cocooning is also expected to last for the foreseeable future, until vaccines or treatments for Covid-19 are found.Builders hope to restart the construction industry by picking up work in almost complete sites, before moving to outdoor work on sites such as housing estates and then moving to new estates. Minister for Business Heather Humphreys told the Dáil all businesses must adhere to the guidelines when they re-open. She said they would be backed up “through inspections and enforcement using the full suite of resources available across the State”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4242921.1588346552!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"woman 90 raises almost 13 000 for charity through dancing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCocooned 90-year-old Kathleen Lynch from Blackrock, Co Louth leading a socially distanced danceathon. Photograph: Alan BetsonA woman who celebrates her 90th birthday today has raised almost €13,000 for Age Action and the Irish Red Cross through the medium of dance.Kathleen Lynch from Co Louth had been planning a one-woman 90-minute dance party in her back garden starting at midday on Friday and reaching a crescendo at 3.09pm to mark the exact moment she was born in 1930.Her husband, 94-year-old Donnie, was also planning to get involved to dance at least one waltz during that time.But then she decided to broaden her ambitions by calling on the rest of Ireland to join her for a one-minute dance at the exact time of her birth. Paramedics from the Red Cross, gardaí and even a couple of nuns answered the call and showed up at her home to lend their support over the course of the afternoon.Perhaps more important than the dancing was the money she managed to raise in just a few days. A GoFundMe page set up by her family to raise money for the Irish Red Cross and Age Action, which has set up a hardship fund to help vulnerable older people experiencing added financial stress due to the Covid-19 crisis, attracted hundreds of donations .Kathleen’s aim was to raise €1,000 but shortly before 3pm on the day of the dance, the total was just under €13,000.Her daughter, Geraldine, said her mother had been “completely humbled” by the outpouring of support for her charity fundraiser.“How it all started was that she said she didn’t want anything for her birthday because of the situation in Ireland at the minute and then she said if we wanted to do something would we give money to a charity that needed it at this time,” Geraldine said.“So she chose the two charities because they were dealing with the fund for older people.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4242320.1588284284!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus people may be asked to stay at home while cocooners are out under new plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGardaí are planning wide-ranging operation this bank holiday weekend to ensure public adhere to travel restrictionsCurrent restrictions introduced to deal with Covid-19 are expected to largely remain in place in the coming weeks as the Government will on Friday approve a plan to gradually reopen Ireland.The plan is also expected to be subject to ongoing changes over the summer months, with inidual measures open to alteration or reversal. However, there is pressure from Ministers to ease the cocooning recommendations for the over-70s and widen the 2km travel restriction. Some TDs have also called for hardware and DIY shops to reopen.The National Public Health Emergency Team will make a recommendation to Cabinet on Friday on what Taoiseach Leo Varadkar called a “road map to reopen Ireland”. The Government will also announce an overall package of supports to go in tandem with the easing of restrictions.Mr Varadkar said easing restrictions would depend on the progress of Covid-19, along with healthcare capacity and resilience, testing and contact-tracing capacity, the ability to shield at risk groups and the risk of secondary morbidity.He said the lifting of restrictions would be done in “a stepwise, tiered manner”. He also added: “Restrictions may have to be reintroduced if it looks like the virus is going to surge back.”It is expected that the existing restrictions will largely remain in place for a number of weeks, expected to be a fortnight, past their initial May 5th expiry date.At a briefing for Ministers on Thursday, chief medical officer Tony Holohan said the plan would be reviewed in “three-week cycles”.Numerous Ministers pressed for restrictions on those over 70 to be eased. Dr Holohan said it was up to Government to make decisions, with Ministers privately acknowledging they may have to erge from medical advice at some point.Cabinet sources said the isions between Ministers who want to ease restrictions relatively quickly and those who were cautious has become more pronounced, with one predicting the meeting on Friday “may not be all plain sailing”.The initial stages of the plan envisage allowing the over-70s out for a walk on a “no-contact” basis, with sources previously suggesting others may be asked to stay at home while “cocooners” are out. Meanwhile, there was no agreement reached in talks on Thursday on a proposed new national safety protocol to apply in workplaces. However, it is understood that trade unions considered a draft protocol, prepared by Government officials and presented in recent days, to fall far short of what was needed.It is understood that detailed guidance will be given for workplaces in areas like social distancing and cleaning protocols as well as around canteens and other gathering places. Office workers will be encouraged to work from home, and flexible working hours will also be encouraged when offices return to avoid overcrowding on public transport.Builders hope to restart the construction industry by picking up work in almost complete sites, before moving to outdoor work on sites such as housing estates and then moving to new estates.Businesses and manufacturing are expected to open in the early stages of the plan if they adhere to social distancing and health rules.The Health and Safety Authority and environmental protection officers from councils are understood to be tasked with ensuring such requirements are met.Minister for Business Heather Humphreys told the Dáil all businesses must adhere to the guidelines when they re-open.\u0026nbspShe said they would be backed up “through inspections and enforcement using the full suite of resources available across the State”.Separately, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan has said An Garda Síochána is planning an “extensive” operation this bank holiday weekend to ensure that the public adhere to travel restrictions.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4242907.1588344959!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coveney insists he has not ruled out a 7 emissions target","story":"Fine Gael has moved to clarify Tánaiste Simon Coveney did not say the Greens could “forget” a 7 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions following negative reaction in an interview published on FridayThe Irish Examiner reports the Tánaiste said the Green Party can forget its 7 per cent emission target if it decimates farming and rural Ireland.The Greens have insisted that they will not consider entering a coalition with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil unless they agree to accept an average reduction of 7 per cent in emissions between now and 2030.In an interview on RTÉ’s Today with Seán O’Rourke show, Green Party deputy leader Catherine Martin referred to the “forget” comment twice and said she was disturbed and shocked by it.The Green Party parliamentary party will meet later this evening to continue their discussions into a third day on whether they will enter government formation talks with the two bigger parties.The 16 TDs, MEPs and Senators are ided on whether or not to proceed to discussions, with a minority arguing very strongly against going in, not only on climate change grounds, but also on issues surrounding housing and social justice.Meanwhile a meeting of Fine Gael ministers of state heard near-unanimous opposition to the seven per cent emissions reductions target.Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee asked each minister for their view on the issue and a consensus emerged that the target is “not doable” with concerns expressed about the potential impact on rural Ireland.’Serious scepticism’One source said that there was “serious scepticism” that the target could be reached, with speculation at the meeting that an autumn election may be on the cards if an agreement cannot be reached with the Green Party.“Seven per cent can’t be done from year one without pulling the economy down,” said another source, who said there is growing unease that the Green Party do not want to participate in Government regardless of the emissions target.The Tánaiste’s comments in addition to the views of Fine Gael Ministers for State has caused unease among Green parliamentarians about Fine Gael’s sincerity on being open to a 7 per cent target. Some in the Green – and senior figures in Fianna Fáil – expressed surprise at the timing of the intervention, and the implications it might have for the Greens’ internal deliberations.A spokesman for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “We are fully committed to engaging with the Green Party.”In their joint response to correspondence from the Greens, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin did not state they accepted the 7 per cent target, but added they would be willing to interrogate and explore how it could be achieved in a way that also ensured recovery could take place.A spokesman for Mr Coveney said the phrase that the Green Party can forget (7 per cent) was not language used by the Tánaiste in the interview.In the interview, the Tánaiste is quoted as saying: “I am not ruling out 7 per cent. I’d love to really interrogate that number and what would be necessary to make it happen to then decide politically can it be done in a way we can bring the public with us.”However, he returned to the theme as to whether it was doable or realistic several times, saying it could not impact on the State’s capacity to get people back to work or rebuild the economy.In the interview, he was also adamant any plan could not jeopardise the future of farming or rural Ireland.“Well if it decimates rural Ireland, we are not doing it. Okay let’s be very clear on that right now. We are not going to sign up to a programme for government that decimates rural Ireland. That will never happen. Okay, even if that means another election.”Speaking on RTÉ, Ms Martin said: “It’s quite shocking coming from the Tánaiste. This is not the Green Party’s 7 per cent, this really needs to be clarified, this target comes from an international agreement, a treaty, the Paris Agreement – it also matches the revised EU target in the European Green Deal.”“The question should not be how do we achieve the 7 per cent, the actual question that needs to be asked is, is seven per cent enough? Now we have a case where the Tánaiste of the party, it was Fine Gael who signed this international document ... it’s quite frankly disturbing and why don’t they know how to do this if they signed the agreement in 2015?”Ms Martin said that alarm bells were ringing, “alarm bells are also ringing for us when it comes to the provision of public housing and public land, they seem to want to pursue the private housing model still, what lessons have been learned there? Direct provision, it’s much more than the 7 per cent. It’s key social issues.”Privately a senior Government source said negotiations could not be conducted via media interviews or by letter and it was up the Greens to decide if they are in negotiations or not. “It’s been 84 days since the election,” said the source.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4241903.1588275015!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"roadmap to reopen ireland varadkar says five criteria at play flights may resume in august","story":"An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has warned that the easement of the current Covid-19 restrictions will be slow and gradual, but that a roadmap to reopen Ireland is being developed. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar speaking in the Dáil on Thursday.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the roadmap to re-open Ireland to a “new normal” is being developed and will be approved by Cabinet on Friday.However, he said the changes to the current restrictions will be made every two to four weeks and will not happen as fast as the restrictions were put in place.And he warned that restrictions may have to be reintroduced “if it looks like the virus is going to surge back”.Speaking during a sitting of the Dáil on Thursday, Mr Varadkar also raised the prospect of commercial flights recommencing in August and rejected claims the State was favouring carriers rather than consumers on flight refunds.“I want to see Ryanair and Aer Lingus operate some time later in the summer, possibly August, and I would not like to be in a situation whereby we have to bail out airlines because they have failed,” he said.The Dublin South West TD criticised the Government for “allowing airlines off the hook” and said Aer Lingus should be re-nationalised.He said the Government “wants the airlines to be able to keep cash and issue vouchers instead, which is effectively bailing out the airlines with consumers’ money”.The Taoiseach told him that whether carriers are publicly or privately owned “is not my major concern”.Earlier Mr Varadkar called a special briefing with Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan for Cabinet members on Thursday morning. Many ministers relayed their concerns about restrictions but it is understood Dr Holohan suggested there will be no major moves in easing restrictions when the current period of lockdown ends of May 5th. The Cabinet is to meet at 3pm on Friday to sign off on the exit plan from the lockdown.Mr Varadkar s said gardaí and the PSNI need to co-operate to enforce movement restrictions on both sides of the Border, rather then the Government amending regulations to deal with day trippers.It emerged that emergency legislation restricting movement to 2km from home did not cover visitors from the North unless they stayed overnight.Mr Varadkar told the Dáil he had consulted the Attorney General and no changes to emergency legislation are needed.“Unless we prohibit people crossing the border, which we are just not going to do, what is required is co-operation,” he said, adding that An Garda and the PSNI need to co-operate to enforce laws on both side of the border.Five criteriaIn the Dáil Mr Varadkar identified five criteria for future decision making on restrictions - the progress of Covid-19 along with healthcare capacity and resilience testing and contact tracing capacity the ability to shield at risk groups and the risk of secondary morbidity.He said that they will find a pathway out of the tunnel but “we are still in the tunnel and have some distance to go.”Speaking in the Dáil the Taoiseach also expressed concern that people who need medical help are not seeking it. Mr Varadkar said “cancer hasn’t gone away”.He said Ireland was now in sixth place in the world for testing per head of population and 160,000 tests had been carried out.Personal protective equipment was now being delivered regularly to nursing homes but there were concerns that in homes with no Covid-19 cases there was a risk that someone could bring it in who was doing the testing.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said here is widespread unease about the manner in which some decisions are being taken, and he said that there had to be more clarity on how policies are decided.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said it was unfortunate that Government Ministers were thinking out loud and kiteflying and setting out May 5th as a red letter day and then accusing them of being complacent.Ms McDonald said testing of up to 100,000 a week was necessary while the Taoiseach said that 100,000 was not a target but testing would take place as necessary.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4242166.1588270051!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus north netherlands stopped following national advice here s what happened","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn intensive care patient is moved from an air ambulance at the University Medical Center in Groningen, the Netherlands. Photograph: Robin UtrechtEchoes WireBarcroft Media via GettyAccording to the official Dutch count, there have been 4,795 coronavirus deaths in the Netherlands. This is an underestimate: it only includes people who tested positive, and mortality data suggests actual deaths are 40 per cent higher. It also disguises deep regional differences.In the worst-hit region of North Brabant in the south, twice as many people died between March 16th and April 5th, 2020, than in the same period last year. But in the northern region of Groningen, home to a university city the size of Cork, deaths were just 4 per cent higher in the same period.What can explain this stark difference in a country half the size of Ireland that is one of the most densely populated in the world?The man held partly responsible is Prof\u0026nbspAlex Friedrich, a virologist and head of microbiology and infection control at\u0026nbspthe University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), the major hub of medical care in the northern Netherlands.Friedrich announced on March 19th that the north was departing from national Dutch policy. While the public health agency would be restricting testing to only severe and priority cases, he announced the north would follow\u0026nbspthe World Health Organisation’s advice: “test test test”.\u0026nbsp“In the Netherlands, in our country, they said that diagnostics is interesting for statistics but not important for the fight against the disease. There I strongly disagree,” Friedrich told The .The UMCG set up a test centre on its grounds, hired medical students for extra staff, and asked the local health authorities to direct people there for screening.\u0026nbsp“We just did it,” Friedrich recalled. “You save lives by doing diagnostics. Proper diagnostics, case tracing, information, is one of the strongest weapons we have to fight the virus.”International insightCrucial to the decision-making was an international perspective. Friedrich did not rely on the limited academic studies available on the new virus, but directly telephoned doctors in Italy to ask what they were seeing in their patients.He learned they were spending twice as long in intensive care than Dutch national modelling accounted for, and he adapted the hospital’s plans accordingly. Friedrich maintains that learning from the experience of other countries is crucial to fighting the pandemic.This insight was important, but so was luck.School holidays in the Netherlands are staggered. The north had theirs a week earlier than the rest of the country. It meant that Dutch people from the south and west were much more likely to bring coronavirus home from skiing holidays in Austria and Italy, as they travelled when outbreaks there were more widespread. This was compounded by the mass public events of carnival season, which are held in the south but not the north.This meant when the Dutch government finally began banning public events on March 10th, it was too late for Brabant, but not for Groningen, according to Friedrich.“We talked to the public health service and said we are going to do something different from the national way,” he recalled.A few initial detected cases in Groningen were health workers who had travelled abroad. But soon\u0026nbsptests were discovering Covid-19 in health workers who had travelled only to other regions of the Netherlands.“We realised there was no difference anymore between the south and the west of the Netherlands and northern Italy. So we told our staff: you are not allowed to go outside our region, and if you do so you cannot come to work. You have to stay at home for two weeks,” Friedrich said.With 15,000 staff and as the central healthcare node for the whole region, the UMCG was big enough to set policy for the wider north. According to Friedrich, the decisive intervention was screening healthworkers, whether or not they had symptoms. A fifth of those who tested positive never developed any.“In healthcare institutions, 10, 20 or 30 people can be infected by just one person,” Friedrich said. “In other parts of the country where the numbers are still high, I suspect it is outbreaks in healthcare institutions and long-term care that are the major drivers of the epidemic.”‘Group immunity’Though Friedrich has been part of the outbreak management team that co-ordinates the Dutch response to the crisis, he is critical of aspects of national strategy.On March 16th prime minister Mark Rutte announced that the Netherlands would build “group immunity” by allowing the virus to roam the population in a controlled manner. The government subsequently walked back from this, but the policy still has its adherents.Friedrich is not one of them.“Herd immunity can never be a public health strategy. It can never be controlled, and it means people will die, and if you are not very careful a lot of people will die,” Friedrich said.“It’s not a law that we’re all going to get infected. It’s just the consequences of our insufficient action to protect people.”He has doubts about whether survivors of the disease even reliably built immunity. “Immunity does not happen automatically,” Friedrich said. “It might be very local, in the nose or throat. But then you could swallow the virus, and get an infection in your gut.”Delaying the spread gives doctors and scientists time to understand the disease and develop more effective treatments, which Friedrich believes will emerge more quickly than a vaccine.“For a vaccination you need to produce it for all the billions of people on the planet, which takes time, and you have to administer it,” he explained.“It’s not like a therapy that you give to a sick person: there, you might take into account there are side effects, but consider them acceptable because you have to save a life. If you are giving a vaccination to healthy people all over the world, you need to be very, very sure that this is safe.”His focus now is preparing for the winter, the worst season for respiratory infections. Friedrich expects it to bring a wave of infection that was worse than the first.“We need personal protective equipment, we need more intensive care beds, we need more healthcare staff, we need more diagnostics in all hospitals in the country,” Friedrich said.“You cannot expect things will go back to normal, thinking that normal is the world as it was before February. That is not really realistic. We have to change so that we can handle this.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4242208.1588271612!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu tells uk it must set out plans for northern ireland customs checks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier: the commission told member states that the Northern Ireland protocol was the biggest challenge in implementing the withdrawal agreement.

The exchanges in the specialised committee now urgently need to be followed up by tangible measures,” it said.Earlier, the commission told member states that the Northern Ireland protocol was the biggest challenge in implementing the withdrawal agreement governing Britain’s exit from the EU. In a technical note seen by The , the commission said the most politically sensitive issue required the most extensive adaptations by businesses and needed the most timely preparation.“To avoid disruptions of business activity, the United Kingdom should urgently engage with the business community in Northern Ireland, as businesses must be able to prepare for the new requirements well in advance.

Here is what we know:There is ample evidence that the NHS has coped during the epidemic. In fact, it now appears that the incessant plea to ‘protect the NHS’ has been heeded so well by the public that they stayed away from hospitals even when they desperately needed help.Despite a big rise in excess deaths not linked to Covid-19, thousands of hospital beds are empty, A\u0026ampE units have seen drops of 41 per cent in attendance and the numbers of cancer referrals by consultants have reduced by two thirds.At the peak of the crisis over the Easter weekend, figures from the NHS operational dashboard showed that 40.9 per cent of acute beds were unoccupied about four times the normal number. Of 91,600 beds available, just 37,500 were occupied. In the same week of 2019, some 90 per cent of critical care beds were occupied.The new Nightingale hospitals are also largely unused. At the peak of the epidemic just 19 patients were being treated at the 4,000 bed east London hospital.The race to ramp up intensive care provision was based on modelling by Imperial College which suggested that nearly five per cent of the UK population would need to be treated in hospital for an average of 10 days during the epidemic, and almost a third of those will need intensive care.But that has failed to be the case. There have been just over 170,000 cases of coronavirus so far in the UK.There is also growing concern about the collateral damage of lockdown. Last week, the head of the NHS launched a major new drive to persuade the public to seek the urgent care and treatment they need.Research by Professor John Appleby, Chief Economist at the Nuffield Trust has shown that around 20 per cent of the recent excess deaths cannot be attributed to coronavirus. Likewise, analysis by Oxford University showed that between March 30 and April 5 in Scotland there were an extra 38 cancer deaths, 103 circulatory deaths and 83 extra dementia deaths.Urgent cancer referrals across England have dropped by 62 per cent while chemotherapy treatments are running at just 70 per cent of normal levels.Such figures will pile pressure on the Government to end lockdown before the numbers of people dying from not receiving treatment passes those dying from coronavirus, particularly as experts have suggested that two thirds of Covid-19 deaths would probably have died this year from another condition. The daily death figures released by the Government have shown an unsettled picture since the virus peaked over the Easter weekend. Difficulties in recording data and changes to how the figures are collated has led to a confused picture day by day, with deaths rocketing from the 300s to more than 1,100.Sir Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser, has warned that cases were ‘not coming down as fast as they went up’ and said that Britain was in a ‘bit of a plateau stage’.However  analysis of the rolling seven-day death rate shows that there is a steady downward trend, and the average daily death rate is now just over 700.Looking at trends over a week gets rid of the ‘weekend effect’ where cases fall on Saturday and Sunday because of lack of staff to record them, before bouncing to artificially high levels midweek.The number of daily deaths is now falling by approximately 100 every 7 days, since the rolling rate peaked at 943 on April 14. It is now at 712.Britain still looks set to have one of the worst death rates in Europe, but the Government has warned that it is wrong to judge mortality statistics based on the raw data without adjusting for population demographics. Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, also cautioned against measuring Britain’s death rate against that of other countries, warning that ‘collating of data internationally is bedevilled with difficulties and comparisons are very, very difficult.’On the week that Britain went into lockdown, Imperial College calculated that the reproduction - ‘R’ rate of coronavirus was around 3.7, meaning that every person who contracted the disease would go on to infect nearly four more people, leading to rapid exponential growth. The rate is now believed to be between 0.6 and 1, although some experts have pointed out that it is extremely difficult to get an accurate measurement when little surveillance work is being done in the population. Latest surveillance data from the Royal College of GPs (RCGP) shows that the infection rate is now 11 per 10,000. To put this into context, an influenza epidemic would not be reached until rates were at 40 to 10,000.The daily testing figures released by the Government are distorted because they only test people who are showing symptoms of the virus, rather than the wider population.Nevertheless,  analysis shows that the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus has actually fallen dramatically in recent weeks.Just seven per cent of people are now testing positive for the virus, the first time it has fallen below 10 per cent since March 18. The numbers peaked on April 11, when 8,719 people tested positive out of 12,776, a massive 68 per cent. The ramp up in testing has made it seem that new cases largely plateaued, to around 4,000 to 5,000 a day for the past few weeks. But, by April 20 fewer than 40 per cent of people were regularly testing positive, and that dropped to under 20 per cent by April 25.On April 24, the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said that the coronavirus infection rate had fallen low enough to start thinking about lifting some of the restrictions.Giving evidence at the Science and Technology Select Committee, Prof Whitty said that the ‘R’ rate was now below one, a critical milestone in suppressing the disease.Social distancing has prevented people spreading coronavirus to such an extent that a single infected person will now infect less than one other person, meaning the virus is dying away.Prof Whitty told MPs that there was now ‘a little bit of scope for manoeuvre and taking some things off while still keeping it below one’. It is likely that there will be a phased release of restrictions with measures being lifted one at a time to see how they impact the reproduction rate. Sourcing enough Personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect NHS staff and care home workers continues to cause problems for the Government, and could be the hurdle that holds up release from lockdown. A global shortage has led to an international scramble for equipment, and the cost of supplies has rocketed six fold. But many countries have fared better than Britain, which has come under fire for its inadequate preparation even though a contingency planning exercise in 2016 highlighted the lack of stocks.The Government’s pandemic stockpile had no gowns, visors, swabs, or body bags by the time coronavirus reached Britain. To make matters worse, some deliveries, including those from China, have failed to turn up or have contained the wrong equipment on arrival. Frontline workers are still complaining that they are short of protective gowns and masks while care home deaths continue to rise amid claims that elderly people are being left like ‘sitting ducks’ because staff have no way to isolate infected residents.However, after a shaky start, the Government now appears to have testing under control and looks set to meet its 100,000 a day target and has plans to increase capacity to 250,000 a day.A huge effort to involve the private laboratories and companies has allowed a surge in capacity and the Government has promised that anyone who wants a test will soon be able to get one. Mass testing will be crucial for a ‘test, track and trace’ strategy that the Government is hoping to adopt once lockdown is lifted. An NHS app will tell people when they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus so they themselves can be quickly tested and self-isolate if they have the virus.The fifth hurdle, which ministers have always said is the most important, was originally designed to entirely avoid a second peak. But on April 28, the wording was changed to say the aim was to avoid a second peak ‘that overwhelms the NHS’  making it easier for ministers to say the test had been met. Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, has repeatedly pointed out the NHS has never been overwhelmed during the current crisis, which means that ministers could now argue that the NHS would be able to cope even if infections rose sharply again.There is growing speculation that the Nightingale hospitals were built specifically to cope with a second wave, rather than the current epidemic. Some scientists do not believe that a second wave is inevitable.Analysis Carl Henegan, Professor of Evidence-based Medicine, and honorary research fellow Tom Jefferson, at Oxford University, studied eight epidemics and pandemics and found inconsistent evidence for new waves.Even if a second wave did occur, new research by the University of Sussex has also shown that lifting the lockdown by the middle of May rather than the middle of June would result in a similar number of deaths in a second wave.Changing the length of lockdown from eight, 12, or 16 weeks would change the timing for the peak of the UK’s second wave of virus casualties but would have very little effect on the total number of infected, critical care cases, or deaths in the second wave, the researchers conclude.For an eight-week lockdown introduced after 10 weeks, the total number of deaths by the end of the epidemic compared to the number of deaths for no lockdown is between 7.1 per cent and 19.5 per cent lower. By comparison, the reduction in deaths from quarantine of equal length introduced after six weeks was only 3 per cent at best.Dr Konstantin Blyuss, Reader in Mathematics at the University of Sussex, said: “Although, in each case we explored, there will be a second epidemic peak after the quarantine is lifted, interestingly and quite counter-intuitively, the later quarantine is introduced, the smaller this second peak will be.“This reduction becomes quite substantial for quarantines introduced at a later stage.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"governments stay home message successful leaving people anxious","story":"The Government’s stay at home message has been “too successful”, a leading statistician has said as he warns that people are “over anxious” about coronavirus.Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter said that a public information campaign to encourage people to “get out and start living again” might be needed when the lockdown is lifted.  Prof Spiegelhalter, who is chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge University, agreed that most are more at risk from driving a car than coronavirus.It comes as a recent survey for Ipsos Mori suggested that more than 60 per cent of Britons would feel uncomfortable carrying out their usual activities - like going to bars or restaurants, or using public transport - if the lockdown is eased.It suggests the public is nervous about a quick return to normality, with 61 per cent saying they would feel uncomfortable using public transport or going to bars and restaurants.Young people are most at ease with going to bars and restaurants, with 36 per cent of 18-34-year olds comfortable doing so, compared to only 22 per cent of those aged 55-75. Prof Spiegelhalter told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “This is very worrying indeed and our research has shown that people in the UK are particularly anxious about this and are reluctant to go out.“If you are old and vulnerable, you are very sensible, you really do need to protect yourself, but the risks drop so much when you get younger.”He said that the fact that the deaths of healthy young people are often highlighted means that “many people are definitely over anxious about their chance of both getting the virus and the harm that they might come to if they do get it.”Prof Spiegelhalter pointed out that young people are not as vulnerable to the disease but the risk “doubles for every seven years extra in age.”  “I think we do need to have some sort of campaign to encourage people who are very low risk to get out and start living again, when we are able to,” he said. “It’s very difficult but we have to stratify people into different risk categories and just make sure that the low risk people are able to go out and live their lives again, when appropriate, because otherwise everyone is living in a life of anxiety and fear.”But he agreed that it was much more difficult to reassure people that it is safe to go out than it is to scare them to stay home, adding: “Maybe our campaign has been, if anything, a bit too successful.”Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, said that it was still too soon to change the message, adding: “The advice today is that we still need to be adhering strictly to the guidelines”. He said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson will set out next week how people can safely return to work and public transport as he announces the ways in which lockdown measures are eased.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch covid 19 teaches us human behaviour","story":"What can our response to pandemics tell us about our social psychologies?

The Covid-19 spread has affected a lot of livelihood, a lot of people\u0027s lives. It has created a crisis, death in general. So I would like to ask not one single person, but all people worldwide, to converge and join the platform that this is something that nobody can fight inidually, said Mack.Dr Laura Bontempo, 50, an emergency medicine doctor wears her personal protective equipment she uses when she sees patients, while posing for a photograph after a nine-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moments have actually been separating families from patients, there is a no-visitor policy now and taking people away from their loved ones is very challenging, Bontempo said. I\u0027m used to treating sick patients. I treat sick patients all the time. It\u0027s very different knowing that the patient you are treating, is actually a risk to you as well. That\u0027s the main difference here. No one who works in hospitals is afraid of treating sick people. Just want to keep staff safe and the patients safe at the same time.Ernest Capadngan, 29, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment during the shift was just seeing Covid patients die helpless and without their family members beside them, Capadngan said.Martine Bell, 41, a nurse practitioner in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a six-hour shift outside the hospital where she works. The hardest thing in all of this, has been taking care of fellow healthcare providers. It really hits home and it\u0027s really scary when you see someone that could be you coming in and now you\u0027re taking care of them. It\u0027s also hitting home that once healthcare providers start getting sick, who is going to be taking care of the public, Bell said. It\u0027s very stressful, everyone is on edge. We don\u0027t know who\u0027s coming in next, or how sick they\u0027re going to be, or if we are going to get a whole bunch of people or if we\u0027re not going to get no one. It\u0027s a really stressful and just a completely unusual time for all of us.Kaitlyn Martiniano, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital. We have a lot of patients and they are pretty sick right now but we have not yet been hit as hard as New York or Seattle, so I feel like we are very lucky with that so far. Every day you have to just be optimistic. Said Martiniano. I think the reason that we are not being hit as hard right now is because so many things are closed, and because so many people are staying at home.Tracey Wilson, 53, a nurse practitioner in an intensive care unit (ICU), poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. I had a patient fall out of bed today and I had to call his wife and tell her and she couldn\u0027t come see him, even though she pleaded and begged to come see him, Wilson said. There is a lot of unknowns and with that unknown is a lot of anxiety and stress that we\u0027re not used to dealing with.Meghan Sheehan, 27, a nurse practitioner in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. I think the hardest moment has been the fear that lives within all of us. There is a lot of unknown right now. We fear what\u0027s going to happen tomorrow, how the emergency department will look next week when we come in. We have fears about our own colleagues, whether they will fall ill. We also fear that we could be asymptomatic carriers and bring this virus home to our families and our loved ones. There has been a lot of fear over our supplies and whether we\u0027ll run out. And then obviously there is the fear that we will see patients and not be able to do everything we normally can to help save patients\u0027 lives,  Sheehan said.Kimberly Bowers, 44, a nurse practitioner in an ICU, poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was a young woman who died and her family wasn\u0027t able to be here with her, Bowers said. I think right now, it\u0027s just frustrating and scary just not knowing what comes next.Tiffany Fare, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. One of the hardest moments was having to see a family member of a Covid patient, say goodbye over an iPad, rooms away. That was a tough one, I can\u0027t imagine how hard it would be to be saying goodbye, you can\u0027t see your loved one and then they\u0027re gone, Fare said. My team has been really great to me. We\u0027ve worked really well together and we\u0027ve really come together in this crisis. We don\u0027t really know each other, we all come from different units within the same hospital, so for us to come together and work so well as a team, it\u0027s been a journey but I think that\u0027s what is giving me hope.Dr Kyle Fischer, 35, an emergency medicine doctor, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where he works. Since it\u0027s a new virus, we don\u0027t have any experience with it. For most diseases I am used to seeing it and taking care of it and this, I don\u0027t have any starting place. I know what I\u0027m hearing from New York, I\u0027ve read all of the papers it seems like, but no one knows what the correct answers are, so there\u0027s a huge amount of uncertainty and people are really, really sick. So it\u0027s hard to second guess whether or not you are doing the right thing when you think you are but you never quite know, said Fischer.Julia Trainor, 23, a registered nurse at a surgical ICU, poses for a photograph after a 14-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was having to put a breathing tube in my patient who could no longer breathe for herself and after the breathing tube went in, we called her family and the husband, of course, couldn\u0027t visit her because of visitor restrictions at the hospital. So I had to put him on the phone and hold the phone to her ear, as he told her that he loved her so much and then I had to wipe away her tears as she was crying, said Trainor. I\u0027m used to seeing very sick patients and I\u0027m used to patients dying but nothing quite like this. In the flip of a switch, without the support, they\u0027re completely isolated. They\u0027re very sick. Some of them recover and some of them don\u0027t. But the hardest part, I would think, is them having to go through this feeling like they are alone.Lisa Mehring, 45, a registered nurse who works in a biocontainment unit with Covid-19 patients, poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works in Maryland. Seeing these new moms have babies has been the hardest moment along with having do their pumping for the new moms and them not being able to be with their newborn children, it\u0027s hard to think of the family that they are missing, Mehring said.Jacqueline Hamil, 30, a registered nurse in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift outside the hospital. The hardest moment of my shift today, I was in charge, and we had a really sick patient that was in a really, really small room and usually, when we have sick crashing patients, we can have a ton of resources and a ton of staff go in and help with the nurse and the doctors that are taking care of that patient. But due to the patient being ruled out for the coronavirus, we could only have five or six people in the room at a time and putting on all the gowns and gloves and masks and face shields to protect us in case the patient does have coronavirus, it takes a while, so the nurse that was in there, ended up being in the room for you know 6, 7 hours with minimal breaks and it was hard being in charge and knowing that she was stuck in the room and really nothing I could do to help her, Hamil said.Cheryll Mack, 46, a registered nurse in the emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift outside the hospital where she works.

But due to the patient being ruled out for the coronavirus, we could only have five or six people in the room at a time and putting on all the gowns and gloves and masks and face shields to protect us in case the patient does have coronavirus, it takes a while, so the nurse that was in there, ended up being in the room for you know 6, 7 hours with minimal breaks and it was hard being in charge and knowing that she was stuck in the room and really nothing I could do to help her, Hamil said.We\u0027ve also had a large number of employees who don\u0027t even review content in their daily roles, volunteering to step forward and help make sure we did not see significant negative impacts on that queue, he said.But when pressed by the committee on whether Facebook had the same number of moderators working as before the pandemic, or fewer, Mr Earley said he was unable to answer because the situation was changing each day.Mr Hinds urged Facebook to respond in writing on the issue, while Mr Knight said it appeared that none of the witnesses had been supplied with genuine, hard information on how you are specifically going about tackling Covid disinformation.Andy Burrows, NSPCC associate head of child safety online policy said Facebook\u0027s admission was deeply troubling.Although no-one could have foreseen these circumstances, the reality is platforms for years have failed to protect children from abuse and harmful content, he said.Now those cracks are being exposed and exacerbating a perfect storm for child abuse.This goes to show the urgent need for the duty of care legislation which would force tech firms to protect children on their sites and tackle years of industry inaction head-on.Following a number of fractious exchanges between MPs on the committee and the tech firms\u0027 representatives, Mr Knight said he had not heard any facts from Facebook, while Twitter\u0027s Katy Minshall was accused of using pre-prepared remarks rather than attempting to answer questions.Following an exchange between Google\u0027s public policy and government relations manager, Alina Dimofte, and SNP MP John Nicolson on online gambling, Mr Knight expressed his frustration at the number of follow-up letters the committee would need to write because the three witnesses had been seemingly unable to answer quite basic questions.We will be writing to all the organisations and frankly we will be expressing our displeasure at the quality of the answers - well a lack of answers - that we\u0027ve received today and will be seeking further clarity, the committee chairman said.Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The study details how these symptoms showed up as red or purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin and tended to be\u0026nbspasymmetrical in appearance.Lasting 12.7 days on average, these symptoms were usually aligned with milder forms of the virus and more commonly experienced\u0026nbspby younger patients.The study also found “vesicular eruptions” in nine per cent of cases these\u0026nbspsmall blisters, commonly itchy, were mostly found on the\u0026nbsptrunk of the body, filling with blood and dispersing across a wider area.These\u0026nbspwere experienced more so with\u0026nbspmiddle-aged patients who had suffered from the virus at an intermediate severity and they lasted\u0026nbsp10.4 days\u0026nbspon average.Thirdly, 19 per cent\u0026nbspof cases brought up\u0026nbsp“urticarial lesions”, which may be commonly interpreted as nettle rash – or wheals -\u0026nbsphas have pink or white raised areas of the skin and lasted\u0026nbspon average 6.8 days.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Altogether, the contracts for the initial 10-month period total 967 million US dollars.This is the last piece that we need in order to get to the moon by 2024, Mr Bridenstine said.Nasa shares images of \u0027doomed\u0027 Comet Atlas as it breaks into piecesHe noted it will be the first lunar lander since the last Apollo moon mission in 1972.Over the next 10 months, each company will refine its concept and Nasa will decide which lander to test first.Mr Bridenstine said Nasa will go with the company that has the highest probability of success by 2024.Nasa will rely on its own Orion capsules and Space Launch System megarockets - still under development - to launch astronauts to the moon.The two other companies, Boeing and Vivace, put in bids but were eliminated early on, leaving the three awarded contracts.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The Dynetics lander is so low to the ground that only a few steps are needed, like a front porch, a feature that Nasa gave high marks for safety and efficiency.SpaceX is using its own Starship spacecraft - still under development in Texas - and its own rockets. Blue Origin and Dynetics are partnering with numerous subcontractors, including commercial launch companies.Going commercial, Mr Bridenstine said, will drive down costs while increasing access.It builds off of Nasa\u0027s commercial cargo and crew programs for the International Space Station.Just last November, SpaceX and Blue Origin were among the companies that won contracts to make cargo deliveries to the moon.Nasa wants the new Artemis moon-landing programme to be sustainable, unlike Apollo, with multiple missions and multiple locations on the lunar surface.While only one company will carry the first woman and next man to the lunar surface, all three will participate over the long haul, officials noted.By learning how to live and work on another world - the moon - Nasa will be better equipped to eventually send astronauts to Mars, Mr Bridenstine said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’ve enabled a new paradigm for materials discovery with an unprecedented accelerated pace.”Professor Jian Luo from the University of California San Diego, who also collaborated on the project said: “Ultrafast high-temperature sintering represents a breakthrough in ultrafast sintering technologies, not only because of its general applicability to a broad range of functional materials, but also due to a great potential of creating non-equilibrium bulk materials via retaining or generating extra defects.”Xiaoyu Zheng, assistant professor at UCLA added: “We are delighted to see the pyrolysis time reduced from tens of hours to a few seconds, preserving the fine 3D-printed structures after fast sintering.”The research is published in the journal Science.University of maryland\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Through a range of techniques, we have been able to understand more about its history over the past 9,000 years – but that is a relatively tiny period when compared with the nearly 4.6 billion years the sun has been around.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

And scientists are still unclear about why exactly it is so unusual.It is conceivable that the Sun has been going through a quiet phase for thousands of years and that we therefore have a distorted picture of our star, explained Dr Timo Reinhold, first author of the new study, who published the findings in the Science journal.The scientists behind the research note that it is possible that the Sun can have higher variability over long timescales, or differs from similar stars in ways that haven\u0027t yet been recognised.Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reckless endangerment of public safety by greedy social media firms must stop.”A spokesperson for Twitter said it was removing coronavirus-related content “when it has a call to action that could potentially cause harm”.“We will not take enforcement action on every tweet that contains incomplete or disputed information about Covid-19,” a statement added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Indeed, they have become four times as frequent\u0026nbspin the past half-century.Since the 1970s, it is\u0026nbspestimated at least three dozen infectious diseases have emerged from human interference with animals, including Sars, Mers, Ebola, bird flu, swine flu and the Zika virus. As far back as 2007 the World Health Organisation warned that infectious diseases were emerging at a rate that had not been seen before.The spread of the viruses is put down to a deadly combination of wildlife trafficking and consumption, increasing human encroachment into wildlife habitats as more people live in densely populated areas – and air travel, which enables pathogens to take hold globally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree years ago, an article\u0026nbsppublished by the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information stated, presciently: “The Aids and influenza pandemics have claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The recent Sars and Ebola epidemics have threatened populations across borders. The emergence of Mers may well be warning signals of a nascent pandemic threat.”Zoonotic diseases are complex, and it’s sometimes impossible to say a virus has disappeared, because it might have many different strains, and might mutate and lie dormant. This is a timeline of the main zoonotic diseases to have hit us since the start of the 20th century:Wildlife trade continues in Asia amid calls for restrictions China tries to shut down wildlife trade but markets remain openBlack-market trade ‘may undermine Vietnam ban on disease-rife markets’Stray dogs eating bat meat ‘could have sparked coronavirus pandemic’The 1918 flu pandemic: This was the most severe pandemic in modern times, killing at least 50 million people in two years. It is widely believed that the virus originated in birds because it shared genetic mutations with the bird flu virus later found in Asia, and could have transferred to horses in the trenches of the first world war before spreading to humans. This is disputed, with one study suggesting it came from mammals.Asian flu, 1957:\u0026nbspIn February 1957, a new influenza virus, known as H2N2 emerged in east Asia, which spread into a pandemic. It originated from an avian influenza virus, causing an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide.HIV: First identified in 1981, the disease is thought to have been acquired by people in central Africa hunting chimpanzees and coming into contact with their infected blood. However, studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s, and it has existed in the West since at least the mid to late 1970s. HIV has killed about 35 million people to date, according to the World Health Organisation.Sars:\u0026nbspSevere acute respiratory syndrome is another type of coronavirus, which killed at least 770 people globally in an epidemic in 2002-3. Most victims were in southern China, Vietnam and Singapore. Scientists are not certain of its origins but like Covid-19 it’s thought it could have come from bats and spread to other animals such as civet cats, which are commonly sold in squalid conditions in street markets. The epidemic resulted in more than 8,000 cases, in 26 countries. Of those, 774 died.Swine flu: In 2009-2010 a new strain of flu emerged in pigs in Mexico. The H1N1 virus killed nearly tens of thousands of people in a global pandemic that spread to 214 countries in less than a year. However, overall the outbreak was not as serious as originally predicted, largely because many older people were already immune to it. And the NHS says it now circulates each year and is considered a normal seasonal flu strain, which is covered by the annual seasonal flu vaccine. A study in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Mers:\u0026nbspFirst identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome is also a coronavirus whose symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. With an estimated death rate of 35 per cent, the disease has killed 858 people, according to the WHO. Again, scientists think it spread to humans from bats, this time via camels.Ebola: A 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, killing 11,300 people. Scientists say it began with a child in Guinea who came into contact with infected bats, but it has since been widely linked to the killing and butchering of bush meat, including monkeys, chimps, antelopes, fruit bats, porcupines and rats.Zika: First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, the mosquito-borne virus caused alarm in 2015, when it was thought to be the cause of thousands of cases of microcephaly – a shorter-than-normal head – in babies in Brazil. Outbreaks soon appeared throughout the Americas, Africa and other regions. It was thought to have killed 29 babies.Bird flu: Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, has many different strains but one of those, H7N9, has caused 1,568 cases in humans and 616 deaths worldwide since 2013, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Another strain of the virus, H5N1, first identified in 1997, spread across east and southeast Asia, killing six people in Hong Kong and leading to vast swathes of chickens and turkeys – from Hong Kong to Britain – having to be culled early after contracting the disease.

It is a charity that has adapted with incredible speed to the crisis to help the most vulnerable in our community. In just five weeks, they have responded to the increased demand for food by quadrupling their output. We hope that our donation, coupled with the campaigning power of The Independent, will help the project grow and reach as many as possible of the one in five Londoners at risk of food poverty.”Another substantial contribution came in yesterday from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust, which has assigned £16.5m\u0026nbspto charities at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic and has donated £50,000 to our appeal.How to support our campaignJulia and Hans Rausing,\u0026nbspheirs of food packing giant Tetra Pak, said: “We have been impressed not only by the speed of The Felix Project’s response to the crisis, but the way in which they have managed to get a number of organisations working together to help people across the capital. Efforts like this support communities across London at this time of need, and we are glad to support their inspiring work.”We launched our appeal, in association with the Evening Standard, on Friday 27 March\u0026nbspand have reached £3m\u0026nbspthanks to the generous backing of dozens of London foundations, philanthropists and corporations, including Garfield Weston Foundation, Lansdowne Partners, the Westminster Foundation, Sir Peter Blake, Burberry, Eranda Rothschild Foundation, Citibank and investment holding company Temasek.More than 1,170 members of the public have contributed, donating £103,837 on our Virgin Money Giving page.But there is a sense that we are still in the foothills of the economic crisis, with experts warning the government that food poverty is about to get far worse. The Food Foundation has reported that eight million people in Britain face food insecurity and that three million have been missing meals since lockdown. The Institute for Social and Economic Research at University of Essex estimates that 6.5 million jobs could be lost in the coming months, causing a huge rise in demand for free food.As the biggest supplier of free food in London, The Felix Project has been operating 12 hours a day, six days a week, distributing surplus food to giant community hubs, including Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in Haringey, as well as to 80 charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

A nurse said meals cooked with fresh Felix produce made her feel “that little bit stronger”.All told of their relief\u0026nbspat being able to access healthy food, thanks to The Felix Project, one of the biggest food redistributors in the country, which has quadrupled daily deliveries to 40 tons since the outbreak of the virus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesYesterday, in a sign of further upward spiralling demand, The Felix Project broke its own record, ferrying an extraordinary 44 tons to 73 schools and charities, with the heftiest deliveries going to 11 community super-hubs set up by councils as part of a pan-London effort to tackle food poverty in the wake of Covid-19.Felix, on its own, is now supplying more than 100,000 meals a day, up from 20,000 at the start of the outbreak. This is what some of the beneficiaries, volunteers and charities had to say.How to support our campaignFamily at high riskKaren Barnes suffers from type 1 diabetes, an underactive thyroid and chronic back pain, and is a carer for her son, Aidan, six, who has health issues that affect his immune system“We receive two boxes of Felix-supplied food a week, from Enfield Children and Young Persons Services, as my son and I are both categorised as high risk. We felt a bit hopeless about being in isolation. I don’t have much family and you don’t want to be a burden on other people. So these boxes are a lifeline. It’s exciting when they come as we’re on our own. The person who delivers them leaves them on my doorstep and we chat. It’s a nice interaction.Kim Pallas is a nurse working 12-hour shifts at Barnet Hospital. She picks up dozens of cooked meals to give to her colleagues, made each day by BreadnButter, a social enterprise supplied by The Felix Project.\u0026nbspPrior to the pandemic, BreadnButter taught cooking skills to community groups. It has adapted to the crisis by getting between 300 and 600 food parcels and cooked meals out each day to NHS staff and people in the borough having to self-isolate.“All the patients in our hospital ward are coronavirus patients so it’s been difficult – very emotional and overwhelming at times. You’re just so grateful when fresh, healthy food is put in front of you and you don’t have to think about doing all the cooking,”\u0026nbspsaid Ms Pallas.“The support of the food charities is making a massive difference to people like us. To know people care enough about you to do this makes you feel that little bit stronger to cope with all that’s going on during the crisis. It makes you feel valued.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She struggles to make ends meet and has claimed universal credit since her husband died suddenly from lung cancer five months ago.“I collect food parcels from my children’s school in Enfield once a week. We are in a very hard situation. When my husband died, my life was turned upside down. I was alone but had to look after my 11-year-old son David and six-year-old daughter Ola. I work so I’m lucky, but life is expensive. Felix is a huge help and – now that we are in isolation – so important. We leave the house once a week to collect our parcel so it’s the best part of our week.”Justine, 38, is a mother-of-four who escaped an abusive relationship and lives in temporary housing, claiming universal credit.“I first heard about The Felix Project through my six-year-old son’s school and have been picking up weekly packages since the end of last year.“At the moment, we are in isolation and things are tough, but Felix is a lifeline. I have used food banks in the past but they do not provide fresh food. There are luxury items in my Felix boxes that I could never afford, like Innocent Smoothies and mozzarella cheese. Picking up our box from the school is a weekly highlight. I don’t know what we would do without it.”James Quayle is manager of North Paddington Food Bank: “Before coronavirus we were feeding 100 households per week but now we are supporting more than 600 families. We used to be open one day a week with The Felix Project delivering a single truckload of fresh produce, but since Covid we are open six days a week.We have increased our volunteers from a couple of dozen to almost 300 and I am working 14-hour days. The only other comparable thing was the start of the Syrian refugee crisis when I was on Lesbos and witnessed people coming off boats. Similarly, this feels like a tidal wave.”James Smart, 36, is a volunteer at Made up Kitchen. The Hackney-based project had been bringing various groups together for regular “community feasts”. It stepped up to the crisis by delivering around 500 nutritious meals each week to people in the area who are struggling financially, thanks to 12 crates of surplus food given by The Felix Project each week.Mr Smart – a chef and market trader who had been working at a cheese stall before it had to close – is now giving two days a week as one of half a dozen volunteers cooking and coordinating deliveries with Made up Kitchen.“Like a lot of people my own situation feels uncertain,” he said. “This crisis has hit almost everyone in one way or another, which is quite scary. But it’s great that so many people have been getting out and doing something that matters for their community. We’re doing as much as we can right now, but there’s a lot of people who will need help.”He added: “The Felix Project has been such a massive help. It’s so important they can operate on such a big scale across London because it makes so much of the work of smaller groups possible.”The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

A UK government source close to its negotiating team said the agreement “imposes legal obligations on both sides”.Asked about the note, the Boris Johnson’s\u0026nbspspokesperson said: “The European Commission have chosen to publish its technical note to set out its own views on the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol. It was not shared at recent meetings with the UK nor has it been agreed by the UK government.“Most strikingly, the note appears to miss out the fundamental objective of the Northern Ireland protocol. There is no mention of the BelfastGood Friday Agreement or the peace process anywhere in this seven-page document.“We are committed to complying with our legal obligations under the protocol, just as we expect the EU to comply with theirs. We will continue to take forward discussions on the implementation of the protocol.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Is raising taxes the wrong approach or the Governments only option One surprise of this crisis has been how easily Britons have accepted the lockdown . Some people seem to positively enjoy it.To some it brings back the spirit of the Blitz a feeling of solidarity. To others fewer cars and planes are an indication of the more green lestyle we ought to be living.Its good that people have managed to cope with these restrictions. But when polls indicate that many people would be prepared to put up with a y extension of the lockdown I begin to worry.An economic interruption of this kind carries massive costs and can only be borne for a limited period. Any extension will become extremely dficult for the economy to bear.The OBR, the Governments independent forecaster, floated the possibility of a fall in output of the economy of  per cent for the period April to June.That is beyond anything that has previously been imagined. It wasn’t a definite forecast butit happened the effects on jobs and living standards would be more than devastating.Some describe this economic crisis as the worst in modern times. It may be the worst ever. That doesn’t mean we cant recover. We can and we certainly will.But its important to be patient. Commentators talk about the economy bouncing back, a so called V shaped recovery.This seems unlikely The economy may bounce back but only up to a certain point not necessarily the same point as before. Some firms will have gone out of business, others will have run up debts, some have missed orders that aren’t repeated.How long all these problems last depends on the lockdown. The longer the lockdown, the deeper the downturn. So it is vitally urgent that the Government relax the lockdown as soon as the scientists feel that the peak of the epidemic has been flattened and that it is appropriate.This isn’t about choosing the economy or lives. A flattened economy costs lives too. Even when we relax the lockdown many will still be nervous and may not want to go out to spend money.The continuing need for social distancing will pose problems for hospitality and other businesses and hold back a full recovery. Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor has been bold, promising to do “whatever it takes” to steer the economy through these perilous waters.His scheme for furloughing jobs with the Government paying up to £ a month of peoples wages has helped to prevent firms getting rid of people that they could not afford But it is eye wateringly expensive with costs estimated at up to £billion.Clearly it cannot continue indefinitely. Ironically the generosity of the scheme may have anaesthetised the public to the scale of the crisis we are facing.Butthe Government lts some of the restrictions soon and the economy starts to recover , what should the Chancellor do in his Budget in November  Of course we don’t know exactly what the figures will look like and we must wait to see before final judgements.Almost certainly he will be confronting a massively reduced economy, groaning under skyscraping debt, higher unemployment and only a gradual recovery.Horric as the borrowing figures will be it would be a mistake to move quickly to reduce the debt before the recovery is firmly established.He should let borrowing take the strain in the short term. Any measures to rein in the deficit should be for later. In order to boost jobs he might cut National Insurance or make a temporary cut in VAT designed to bring forward spending.Keir Starmer gave a menacing hint of his approach when he said there would have to be “a day of reckoning” and hinted at tax increases on the better off as though they were to blame.That would be precisely the wrong approach. As the economy gets back to maybe  per cent of where it was before the Chancellor needs to do all he can to support business.He has recently given some generous help to new high tech start ups. Well and good, but it will be important to continue to support existing businesses.It should never be forgotten that firms that have failed in this crisis have not failed though any fault of their own. This down turn is not a normal recession caused by market forces, a rise in interest rates or overheating.No this recession and the bankruptcies have been caused by the Government’s measures rightly introduced to contain the virus. So the Government should not feel embarrassed about continuing some of their schemes to support inidual businesses and indeed they have a duty to do so.The Chancellor sets the framework but ultimately growth does not come from Governments, it comes from iniduals and firms. The way to growth and recovery is to give them the freedom and the incentives and the rest will follow.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers. The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM. No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Raising taxes in the current climate is not something the Government is likely to want to do.But the scale of the economic crisis now gripping the UK means they may end up feeling they have little option.So far the Chancellor has done what he had to do to protect businesses and workers from enforced shutdowns. The cost will have to come from somewhere.It is estimated the furloughing scheme alone will cost at least £billion. At the same time, tax receipts have noseed as earnings have decreased and fewer people are spending in the shops.As a result, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that public- sector borrowing will increase by an eye-watering £billion above the earlier forecast.The black hole in the country’s finances left by Covid- means that at some point, the Chancellor is going to have to face the uncomfortable issue of whether taxes will go up.Any rises must be set against the need to ensure nothing chokes the ­economic recovery, which will be vital.We must also guard against hitting the most hard-up in society. And ­crucially, we need to ensure we don’t make it unprofitable for dynamic small companies to operate.One option for the Chancellor is to target the big multi-nationals and billionaires who use tax havens to avoid paying their fair share.Yet we will also need to have big business on our side as we try to recover, so it is a delicate balancing act.Our priority right now still has to be protecting the vulnerable and health workers from another Covid- outbreak.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.But it is time too for the Government to think seriously about how to restart the economy as quickly as possible.Two days ago came news that Jaguar and Aston Martin will restart production in May. The Chancellor needs to help other companies follow suit.The more successful he is, the likelier he will be able to limit the number of extra taxes he has to raise in the months ahead.We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.” SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has taken pressure off the NHS. The “sombrero” curve has been flattened.Crucially, we now have spare hospital capacity and, despite a shortage of protective equipment, our NHS frontline has avoided meltdown.Yet we continue to hear the dismal dirge, “Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives”, to the muffled drums of the BBC and its throat-slitting Thought For The Day.While some are breaking those rules, many more — especially the over-s — are too terried to poke their nose outdoors evenit’s safe.So non-Covid hospital wards are empty and countless worried patients are missing le-saving treatment for cancer, kidney or heart disease.Others in lockdown are prone to mental health problems, suicide and fast-rising domestic brutality.

Some will leave lockdown to find their jobs gone, perhaps for ever.The Treasury’s mammoth multi-billion support scheme will leave crippling long-term economic wounds.One in four firms has stopped trading and Britain risks its worst economic slump in centuries.We are not alone. The Eurozone is fighting for its le.

Dirt-poor families in Africa and Asia — reliant on cash sent home by migrant children — are seeing those lelines severed overnight.In America, where Depression-style unemployment is close to million, the revolt against lockdown is already under way.Lockdown is prolonging the worldwide agony. This email from Cambridge post office manager and Sun reader Rob Swt sums up the view of many baffled Sun readers. Rob says: “We allow customers in to match the number serving and everyone has PPE.“At no point has anybody had symptoms or gone absent through coronavirus. We use our common sense then go home to our families before doing it all again the next day.“Along with supermarkets, building sites and some small shops, we have been open throughout and at no point have cases risen to the extent we have had to close down.”If lockdown continues for too long, many of those one- in-four firms which have already stopped trading will not reopen.

Yet on the other side of the world, South Korea has witnessed nothing like the same devastation.To date, there have been just  deaths in the Asian nation, and only , cases - barely a tenth of the British total.While Britain remains in the grip of the storm, South Korea is already emerging from the darkness.What makes this phenomenal gap all the more remarkable is the country’s closeness to China, the initial global centre of the pandemic - which should have left South Korea - a country of  million people - far more vulnerable than Britain to the ravages of the disease.But the South Korean authorities took this seriously, through their prompt action and ruthless efficiency, they quickly managed to get the virus under control.On  February, there had been  new cases, but this daily figure fell dramatically in the subsequent two months, dropping to single digits last week.Amid all the gloom across the earth, South Korea’s astonishing success is a beacon the world.And its achievement is particularly impressive because the nation has not resorted to Chinese or European-style lockdowns.Most of the population has not been placed under effective house arrest, nor has the economy been put into a medically-induced coma.Under strict rules about social distancing, bars, cafes, shops and hotels have remained open.One British journalist based in Seoul, South Korea’s capital, told me that he even had to queue last week for a table at a restaurant in a fashionable district, something that would be unthinkable in Britain.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Only a fortnight ago, elections were held for the country’s National Assembly, won overwhelmingly by the ruling Democratic Party.This week, restrictions on churches and gyms will be relaxed.From early May the South Korean football and baseball leagues will resume, though at first in empty venues.So how has South Korea avoided the kind of crisis that has gripped so many western countries, including our own What is the secret of its success  The answer can be found in a national strategy that combines social responsibility with organisational efficiency, governmental foresight, and sophisticated technology.At heart, South Korea has been better prepared than most.That is largely because the nation was badly shaken by the outbreaks of the respiratory syndromes SARS and MERS earlier in the century.Criticism of the Government’s mismanagement was especially strong after MERS in , which left  people dead.In the wake of this condemnation, testing capacity for a pandemic was drastically expanded, supplies of personal protective equipmentwere strengthened, hospitals were equipped with infection control units, and plans for nationwide information campaigns were put in place.So when the first Covid- deaths occurred in China in January, the South Korea state was ready to swing into action, guided by the principles of “test, trace and contain.”Immediately, a Coronavirus taskforce ordered the swt development of a practical diagnostic test that could identy people who had been infected.The job was completed with amazing efficiency.Within just a week, a reliable testing kit had been approved and put into production.There followed a huge programme of testing, often at the rate of , a day, carried out through a vast network  centres and  drive-through facilities.By March , while Britain was still struggling, South Korea had tested over , people.From the start, screening was also applied to all arrivals at Korean airports, including national citizens, something our own Government has never attempted until now.This testing regime was backed up by a huge effort both to trace all the contacts of those who test positive for Covid  and to alert the public to the presence of disease carriers.In this drive, South Korea has the advantage that its population has embraced online and mobile technology so eagerly.This is, after all, the land of mobile telecoms giant Samsung and computer colossus LG.Thanks to such sophistication, the movements of the infected can therefore be uncovered through phone records, GPS tracking, financial statements and CCTV images.This data enables the Korean Centre for Disease Control and Prevention to send text messages, in real time, to mobile users, telling them of any cases in their vicinity.The information also means that the contacts of carriers can be advised to take extra precautions or go into self-isolation.It is an ultra-modern approach that reflects South Korea’s culture.“Koreans are super-good at making things convenient for people. We don’t have any patience. South Korea is one of the most wired countries in the world, where everybody uses cell-phones for just about everything and the Government is able to use all our phones not only to track but to send warnings,” said Kee Park, a lecturer in public health at Hard in the USA.Some might argue all this hi-tech testing and tracing represents a worrying descent into the authoritarian world of Big Brother.But the level of intrusion should not be exaggerated.These text alerts do not reveal any inidual’s name and address, only their gender and age category.Moreover, “track and trace” technology is far less draconian that the European lockdowns.Nor is it correct to pretend that South Koreans are more submissive than westerners.In reality, the country has been a stable, pluralist democracy since .The public’s willingness to challenge the Government was graphically highlighted by huge mass protests held from October  to March  against President Park Geun-Hye over allegations of corruption.More than .million people took to the streets, eventually bringing about her impeachment and downfall.Far from being some downtrodden state, South Korea is more advanced than many parts of the west and this has further helped in the fight against the virus.Its health service is so well managed that it was ranked the best in the world in a  global study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .There was never any danger of it being overwhelmed, as our own Government feared might happen to the NHS.Again, in contrast to the centralised bureaucracy of the NHS, the South Korean model is privately run, with  per cent of the population covered by compulsory national health insurance.The same spirit of efficiency can be seen right across the Korean infrastructure.Trains, buses and urban metro systems are renowned for their punctuality.Incheon airport, the country’s largest, was ranked the best in the world for  consecutive years from .A dynamic economy, with high levels of exports, ensures that the South Korean population is affluent and well-educated, with more than  per cent of young people going to university.But this prosperity is accompanied by widespread social responsibility, reflected in the strong work ethic and a lower crime rate than most industrialised nations.Respect for others is also shown in the universal willingness to wear face masks, not so much as a barrier against infection but as a means of preventing the spread of disease.A refusal to don one is seen as a social offence, just as Koreans use hand sanitisers everywhere and do not object to the heat sensors that exist in many office buildings to read their temperatures.It is not unusual for citizens to have their temperatures checked a dozen times a day.The climate of solidarity has helped South Korea come through the worst.Its experience provides a lesson to the rest of the world.As Jerome Kim, the Director of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul puts, it, South Korean contained the virus “through decisive, transparent leadership based on data, not emotion.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For every Peter Kay, who you want to see, there are three members of The Mash Report team, who you really don’t. There are also corporate sponsors to satisfy and a surprise appearance from Prince William, in a Blackadder spin-off sketch, with Stephen Fry, asking: “Have you seen anything good on TV ” .On the face of it then, it looked impossible to separate the wheat from all that celebrity chaff.In reality, though, it was surprisingly easy, because lockdown TV has already taught us song and dance can still work, even on Skype,the artists are as good as Dave Grohl and the others, who collaborated on Times Like These, or as talented and attractive as the Strictly professionals.Just as obviously, we’ve learned to rely on the internet for laughs this past month, because television comedy isn’t anywhere near funny enough to see us through a crisis. Thursday night wasn’t ever going to change that opinion, but it did highlight a ide.Eventhey were phoning in the performances, there were a group of comedians some viewers will have been excited to see, like Coogan, Brydon, Dawn French, Little Britain etc, who all had careers before .

On the BBC! It’s one of the many things that’s been missing from the network, for years, though I was glad long-suffering viewers didn’t punish TBNI for past failures. Thursday was hardly the time for mass recriminations.At some point in the future, though, someone has to try to explain to the BBC that we prefer comedians who make us laugh rather than tell us off, andthere was a reason why The Big Night In seemed less wearying and slightly more uplting than the usual Comic Relief slog then, beyond the extraordinary circumstances, it was a very obvious one.It only lasted three hours.

So you can get nests cropping up in all sorts of places youre likely to come near to.Any large expanse of roof — including houses, flats and warehouses — could potentially offer nice protected sites for gulls to go and nest on.And thats a concern at the moment because although it depends on the species, nesting typically starts around mid-April and tends to peak around May.They’re starting to look for nesting sites now.The potential risk is thatthe site is on lockdown and it’s quiet with no human activity, gulls may feel comfortable nesting at there and start establishing nests before any deterrent can be implemented.And that could lead to a long-term problem too.Herring gulls, for example, sexually mature in about four years and can live for up to  years.So typically the young will disappear for four years — they’ll go off to the coast or inland refuse tips — but then theyll come back to the same nesting site.And they’ll use the same spot year on year, so the numbers will gradually increaseinterventions aren’t put in place.Theres all sorts of things we can do to deter gulls — but the lockdown means some of them are a bit trickier.In terms of lethal controls, they should always be a very last resort and the Government has restricted what we can do because all gulls have a level of legal protection.So instead we have to look at things like good proofing , good site management, and hawking.Thats where a trained hawker will use a predator bird, typically a Harriss hawk, to fly in the vicinity of where the pest gulls are.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.So you’re essentially destabilising the area and the gulls associate it with the predator being present.But at the moment, we may be limited on getting access to sites.So any of the planned proofing that we were going to implement or planned hawking sessions, or even the licensed nest and egg removals, might be on hold.That can lead to the gulls nesting and once nests have been established, it becomes harder to manage that population because the numbers are higher.And bearing in mind they’re going to come back in four years’ time, essentially the numbers will rocket up.It puts us on the back foot trying to implement a gull control programme.The main thing you can do to protect yourself and your family is beware of a gulls distressed behaviour before it starts mobbing.So that meansyou see them flying overhead and aggressively calling, respect it and give it some social distance, essentially!The other thing thats key is not to feed them.That will encourage them to come closer to you andthe gull is desperate for food, then they’re going to start swooping down and taking them from your hand.They get braver and braver, so dont encourage them.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.That goes for making sure refuse bins are covered too.Food waste has gone up because of potential stockpiling at the beginning of the lockdown when people were panicked.We saw images where bins were overflowing — which is an open invitation to a hungry gull.So always make sure the bins are closed.But of course, it’s not a single solution that will win the battle — combined suppressive tactics are the key.Where bird activity is present, always seek professional advice on a proper bird management programme. Pest controllers have been classed as essential workers because the diseases associated with pests pose a signicant risk to public health.The last thing you want in a pandemic is a food factory, for example, with a pest problem, which then can’t supply the nation with food during lockdown.So make sure to give us a call — before the gulls come calling for you.Paul Blackhurst is the Head of the Technical Academy at Rentokil. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson suggested that coverings will play a part in his announcement on how the lockdown measures may be eased. The Government had been resisting calls to recommend their use despite Scotlands First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advising the public to use cloth face coverings when in enclosed public spaces. The Prime Ministers official spokesman acknowledged on Friday that the evidence shows they can reduce the spread of the virus from infected iniduals who are not showing symptoms.

Paddy Lillis, Usdaws general secretary said: #There must be lasting and fundamental changes to the way society views our lowest paid workers. We need a new deal for the workers.#Too many key workers are low-paid, with insecure hours and few employment rights. They have been undervalued for too long and deserve a new deal.#There could be a #dramatic# change to how GPs see patients in the future, with around half of consultations moving online, a doctors leader has said. Professor Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, told the Commons Health and Social Care Committee there had been a large uptake in virtual consultations due to Covid-, in part because doctors had been given more sophisticated technology and equipment. He told MPs: #Theres going to be a dramatic change. #So, prior to the pandemic, about % of consultations in general practice were carried out face to face. #Now, according to the data, its about %, I suspect it might even be less than that. #I think the future will be somewhere between where we were and where we are. I dont think that % of consultations have to be carried out face to face before the crisis and I dont think % to % is right either.# Prof Marshall said virtual consultations would not be suitable for all patient needs but about % could be online.Questions over what natural immunity people might develop to coronavirus, and which drugs could help those worst affected could be answered in the next year, an expert advisory group has said. They are among the research priorities highlighted as the most urgent by the Academy of Medical Sciences and the British Society for Immunology, as scientists work around the clock to develop a vaccine and trial medicines amid the pandemic. In a paper published on Friday, the group of  leading immunology experts identied key areas of research into immunity and treatments which they said could be delivered #within - months# provided there is #funding and support for relevant research#. Key areas regarding immunity include establishing what,any, protection is provided by antibodies developed by recovered patients, whether T-cells are involved in generating immunity, and how antibody tests could be safely and reliably used. The paper concludes that the answers to these questions #can help us to understand what herd immunity to this virus may currently exist, or develop within the population#.Wizz Air will resume some flights from Luton airport today, but passengers are required to wear face masks.Flights are due to operate to Budapest, Lisbon and Sofia.Other routes, such as Tenere and Tel Aviv, will resume in the coming weeks, pending travel restrictions.McDonalds has finally confirmed when it’ll be reopening restaurants with  branches to open on May .The fast food giant will be reopening for delivery orders only and with a reduced menu in place.To help keep staff and customers safe, McDonald’s will be installing perspex screens at checkouts and will ask customers to respect social distancing rules.Customers will also be asked to pay for their food with card and contactless payments where possible.More on that breaking story here.Downing Street has declined to contradict President Donald Trumps theory that the coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory.The Prime Ministers official spokesman said: #There are clearly questions that need to be answered about the origin and spread of the virus, not least so we can ensure that were best prepared for a future global pandemic, this work will need to be done with our international partners.#A group of infectious disease scientists in the US have predicted the deadly virus is likely to keep spreading for  to  months # until  to  per cent of the population has been infected.A team of infectious disease researchers led by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policyat the University of Minnesota, used data on past pandemics, and published reports about the medical details of Covid- to make their prediction.They wrote: #Theof the pandemic will likely be  to  months, as herd immunity gradually develops in the human population.#The scientists added that this is because Covid- is a new disease, and no one has any immunity.More on this report here.Urgent cancer referrals across England have dropped by % due to the coronavirus, according to the head of cancer services for the NHS.Dame Cally Palmer, national cancer director for NHS England, said chemotherapy treatments were running at % of normal levels.

Make it with orange juice and a g serving of fruit jelly sees you tick off  per cent of your recommended daily intake of vitamin C.It is also a rich source of folate, which you need for healthy nerves.Not only that, oranges and orange juice give us the super-nutrient hesperitin, which can help with your bone health and immune system.Scientists in Italy say it can also help to lower bad cholesterol, while boosting good cholesterol, reduce inflammation and bring down blood pressure.These provide a sixth of your daily recommended fibre and more than a quarter of your vitamin C, which is vital for immunity and good skin.A g serving has  calories, less than a portion of fries.A store cupboard staple, rice pudding is a rich source of copper and iodine, for healthy skin and metabolism, and bone-building calcium.A g portion has g of protein, g of fat and just  calories.You don’t need it to be Christmas for an excuse to get out the cheeseboard. And there’s even more reason to now that stilton is a superfood.The bacteria Penicillium roqueforti, which creates the blue veins and characteristic flavour, produces metabolites that boost your health, according to scientists.Lab tests revealed the compound andrastin produces anti-tumor molecules and mycophenolic acid, which is an anti-fungal super-nutrient.But watch your serving size as it is high in fat and calories.Stick with a sensible g wedge and you will have just  calories and .g fat.Beanz meanz . . . high in protein. A g serving – half a shop-bought can – has around g, about the same as you would find in an egg.And just three heaped tablespoons of beans makes up one of your five-a-day.They are also high in fibre, giving you a third of your g recommended daily intake, much of which is soluble, meaning it attracts water and makes you feel fuller for longer. So less temptation to snack between meals.Baked beans are packed with iron, with g giving you more than a oz grilled steak.Another benefit is they are super cheap.These are simply hard-boiled eggs that have been preserved in distilled vinegar once cooled.The white of each pickled egg contains g of protein, just half of what a ml serving of milk contains.Not only are they filling, the eggs are rich in vitamin D, needed to absorb calcium for strong bones, B for healthy nerves, iodine for a good metabolism and selenium for immunity.All this goodness is packed into less than  calories per egg.Chop up a bunch of cabbage, onion and carrot and combine with low-fat mayonnaise for a coleslaw full of antioxidant ­carotenes and sulphur-based super nutrients.Eat g for one of your five-a-day.Filling ravioli in a tomato sauce is rich in antioxidant lycopene, linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.It boasts iron and has just  calories in a g serving, with g fat and g protein. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Becausenot, we will go back to a second wave.“It is entirely plausible for a second wave to actually be more severe than the firstit is not mitigated, he added.Whitty said that social distancing measures and other precautions may help prevent a second wave from becoming as severe as it occurs alongside flu and other seasonal illnesses.“It’s not just in Game Of Thrones that winter is always coming – it is also true in every health service. You have to think about winter.“It may be that there’s a seasonal element andso, for most respiratory viruses, they are more likely to be transmitted, there is a higher likely transmission, in the winter.Whitty later added: “The winter is always worse than the summer, spring and autumn for health services.

His anger was in response to Conservative former Cabinet minister David Gaukeaposs defence of reductions in public spending, warning of an even more dficult situation without austerity as he tried to focus on resilience. But the Bristol University professor told BBC Newsnight: I think thataposs nonsenseI may be so bold. The resilience has been stripped systematically out of the system, you cannot, when a big problem like this hits, you canapost just reinvent things and put them back the way you wish they were. If you make the system as lean and emaciated as it is there will not be the public health staff there, there will not be the health visitors, there will not be the environmental health officers and you canapost magic them up out of nowhere. Simply testing key workers, health service workers and the over s really wonapost cut it, so it needs to be a comprehensive programme, he added. Meanwhile, Sir Paul Nurse, chief executive of biomedical research centre the Francis Crick Institute, labelled the Governmentaposs target of , coronavirus tests per day a PR stunt.  On April , Health Secretary Matt Hancock pledged to reach the target by the end of the month. However only , tests were carried out on Tuesday. Speaking on BBC Question Time, Sir Paul said there had been no visible strategy behind the , target. It was, as far as Iaposm concerned, a bit of a PR stunt which has gone a bit wrong, he said. Where was the strategy under that  I havenapost seen a strategy under it. It just sounded good. Sir Paul added that the Government missed the opportunity to make hospitals safer by mass testing healthcare workers regardless of whether they were showing symptoms. If we had had local testing connected to local hospitals, we could have made hospitals a safe place, he said.what we had is the potential for having care workers working on the wards, working with sick patients who were carrying the disease and werenapost being tested. They had such restricted rules on who could be tested that they didnapost simply make the decision that we have to test everybody that is a frontline worker and, in particular, they wouldnapost test anybody who had no symptoms. We were allowing potentially for frontline care workers to be on the wards potentially infecting people because we werenapost testing. Now that may have been because they didnapost have testing capacity throughout the country but you canapost simply say we donapost need to do it because we donapost have testing capacity and even when we could provide testing capacity we couldnapost do it because of the NHS rules. Testing was absolutely critical, it hasnapost been handled properly.

But it comes as a new poll found some Brits are to afraid to venture out when the restrictions are lted. The survey for Ipsos MORI showed % would feel uncomfortable going to large public gatherings such as sports or music events, compared with how they felt before the virus. Only % would feel comfortable attending such an event while % would feel not at all comfortable. Some % would also feel uncomfortable using public transport or going to bars and restaurants – and while % would feel comfortable going out to eat and drink, only % would be happy to use public transport to get there.It demonstrates the dficulties facing Boris Johnson in getting the economy restarted as he prepares to outline a lting of some measures next week.The Governmentaposs stay at home message may have been slightly too successful, according to a top statistician. Polling data suggests more than % of Britons would feel uncomfortable carrying out their usual activities - like going to bars or restaurants, or using public transport -the lockdown is eased. Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter, of Cambridge University, told the BBC: Itaposs much harder to frighten to people to stay at home than it is to reassure them they can go out again. Maybe our whole campaign has been,anything, slightly too successful. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the Government was “working with businesses, sector by sector, to think through how it would be safe toto those factories or office settings or to construction sites, and how they can observe social distancing guidelines and protect the workforce”. He added: “Those are ways in which we will instil much greater confidence in the future in the workforce.” Hereaposs what we know so far about how lockdown could be lted. We’ll have the details by next week  After weeks of pressure, the PM said last night he would outline a detailed plan for lting restrictions next week. We don’t know what day next week yet. Some reports say the government will use the benchmark Germany did - of the number of new daily infections being lower than , before lockdown measures can be lted. But thereported some ministers want the figure to be much lower - in the hundreds rather than the thousands - after Germany’s infection rate rose after restrictions were eased. At least , people tested positive for the virus on Wednesday - a figure boosted by increased test capacity. But cases in the community are still not being tested - so the figure is likely to be much higher. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told Sky News that the country now needed to build some head room between the rate of infectionand one before lockdown measures could be eased. The R [value] is still below one but we need to build some head room, there isnapost an exact figure as to where the R is - itaposs somewhere, the chief medical officer tells us, between . and ., he said. We want to bring R down further than it is today and that matters so that the NHS has sufficient capacity, so that when we do start to ease the lockdown, thereaposs some space, some room, for manoeuvre. He added that the Government approach was a cautious easing over time so that such headroom for the NHS could be maintained and protected. Outdoor jobs and leisure activities could be allowed first  Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said this morning that because the transmission rate of the virus outdoors is lower than it is indoors, there’s “more scope” for some jobs and activities to be OK. He said: “Weaposve been working across government, my own department, the department for Business, the Treasury and of course the Department for Education, to think about the kind of steps that employers will need to take to make their workplaces safe so that people can socially distance in dferent settings, whether thataposs factories or in offices. “The dference between indoor settings and outdoor ones - because we know that the rate of transmission outdoors is much lower, so thereaposs more scope for people ing to work on building sites for example, or more outdoor leisure activities than is likely to be the case for indoor ones.” No decision has been taken on face covering in public - despite what the PM said last night  The government hasnapost yet decided whether to require people to cover their face in public - despite the PM suggesting it at last nightaposs press conference. If face coverings are required, they wonapost be aposmasks. The government doesnapost want to cause a shortage in personal protective equipment that should be available to the NHS. But coverings like a scarf could be recommended.Weaposre expecting guidance next week on what kind of material you can make such a covering from.Mr Jenrick said there was evidence of a “modest” health advantage to wearing face coverings, but not a great one. But he said it might give people “confidence” when they’re asked toto work or using public transport. He told LBC Radio: “Obviously we don’t want to overstate that or make people more cavalier as we’ve seen in some cases where in the world. “It’s a marginal dference but it may be helpful to encourage people to go about their business when we’re able to ease those parts of le and encourage people back into the workplace.” The government doesn’t want to lt lockdowns in dferent places at dferent times - but it might The Communities Secretary steered away from the idea that dferent regions could see lockdown lted at dferent times, based on what the infection rate is in that area. But he said it was a possibility to manage the spread of the infection further down the line. Mr Jenrick said: “When we brought in the measures originally we brought them in across the whole country, and we thought that was the right thing to do for fairness and this was a national endeavour and we didn’t want to set one part of the country against another. “But as we bring forward testing, tracking and tracing we will certainly have to consider thatthe rate of transmission starts to rise in one part of the country, would it be appropriate to bring in certain measures or ease measures in that part of the country and not in others. “I think it’s not something that’s being actively considered, but it’s a possibilitythat’s a good way of managing this in the future.” The contact tracing app should be available by the middle of May  One major tool to manage infection rates and lt lockdown measures is to introduce ‘contact tracing’. Contact tracing involves tracking down as many people as possible who have come into contact with a person confirmed to have caught Covid-. The government expects the app to be available by the middle of May. And itaposs understood the app will be trialled first on the Isle of Wight.

It comes after Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty has warned the country was nowhere near the end of the pandemic.While in an address to the nation yesterday, Boris Johnson said he was looking at a menu of options in terms of leading the UK out of lockdown.The Prime Minister said the UK had overcome the peak of the virus - an official spokesman did not deny the possibility of lockdown continuing until June. Asked on Thursdayit would, he replied: “I think we will have to wait for the review to take place and I don’t think it’s wise for me to preempt that. “What you’ve obviously heard from [Chief Medical Officer] Chris Whitty is that this is a disease that’s going to be around for a signicant amount of time. “He said we have to be realistic, we’re going to have to do a lot of things for a long period of time.” With the lockdown set to continue, hereaposs some key questions answered about what you can and cannot do:Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereWhen can you leave home  The government advice for leaving home as remained the same for a number of weeks. You should only leave home to shop for basic necessities like food and medicine. You can leave home for one form of exercise a day, such as a walk, run or cycle - an these can be done alone or with members of your household. You can leave home to donate blood, avoid injury or illness, escape risk or harm at home or to provide help to a vulnerable person. You can travel to work but onlyyou cannot work from home. You are also permitted to leave home to walk your dog   Can you go to the dentist, my GP or another medical appointment  You can leave home for medical appointments. GP practices might postpone non-urgent health checks and routine appointments. If you are not a critical worker but cannot work from home f you cannot work from home then you can still travel to work. This is consistent with the Chief Medical Officer’s advice. Critical workers are those who can still take their children to school or childcare. This critical worker definition does not affect whether or not you can travel to work –you are not a critical worker, you may still travel to work provided you cannot work from home. Anyone who has symptoms or is in a household where someone has symptoms should not leave their house to go to work and should self-isolate. Verication to prove you need to go to work is not required.  Can you safely visit elderly relatives  In general terms, you should not visit any family members who do notlive with you at home. Where relatives who are elderly or vulnerable are concerned, you may leave home to help deliver provisions or medication.  If you are a regular, formal carer, you may continue to help them as you usually dothat care is essential for their normal daily living. Can you help a vulnerable person You can go out to care for or help a vulnerable person, or to provide other voluntary or charitable services, however you should not do soyou have coronavirus symptoms, however mild.Wherever possible, you should minimise your time away from home, stay at least two metres away from others, and wash your hands for at least  seconds. If you have worries about being made to work by your boss  Employers must make all efforts to help people to work from home where possible. In some circumstances this may be impossible – this would apply to those working for a business or organisation that the government has not required to close and requires them to travel and be at work, such as train or bus drivers, construction workers or those in manufacturing, restaurant workers handling deliveries, or those on the frontline like NHS workers.If iniduals need advice they should approach  ACAS  where they can get impartial advice about in-work disputes. Can you go to workyou are a nanny  If you provide paid-for childcare in a child’s home, you can go to your place of work - this is in line with Government guidance that you can travel to workworking from home However,you or someone in your own home has symptoms, you should not go to work, but self-isolate for seven days and others in your house should self-isolate for  days. You should not work in any household which is isolating and you should wash your hands more often than usual, for  seconds. Can you move house  The government strongly advises against moving house - however the law does permit people to move home.  Can you go to the park  You can still go to the park for outdoor exercise once a day but only alone or with members of your household, not in groups. Communal places within parks such as sports courts, playgrounds and outdoor gyms have been closed to protect everyone’s health. We ask that households use parks responsibly and keep two metres apart from others at all times. Unless you are with members of your household, you must not gather in groups of more than two people in public spaces like parks. The police have the powers to disperse gatherings and issue finesnecessary.  Can you drive to a national park or green space  The government advises against driving anywhere for the purpose of exercise and says people should stay close to the rhomes. However,you live in an area where it’s dficult to stay two metres apart when exercising, you can travel to a more open space to do so – but you should only do thisabsolutely necessary If you have a disability and it is easier for you to travel to a more open space to exercise, this is permitted. There is no time limit on being outdoors, however you should spend as short a time away from your home as possible. Once you have undertaken exercise, you should go home immediately and not linger in public spaces or take a rest, unless absolutely necessary for health reasons."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus pandemic live uk updates","story":"NewsCoronavirus LIVE updates: UK death toll reaches , as  more people dieThe Covid- death toll has risen by  in the past  hours, meaning , people have now died in the UK, where ministers are warning that lting lockdown too quickly could lead to a second peakShareByDanya BazaraaSenior News ReporterMilo BoydUpdated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video boris-johnson-says-past-peak-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-pandemic-live-uk-updates-\"\" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-cdn-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-pandemic-live-uk-updates- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-cdn-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"A further  people have died of Covid- in the UK in the past  hours, taking the total death toll to ,.

The two sides of the busy motorway, which links Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds, separate just before the farm house comes into view, snaking around the property before merging together again a few miles further on. For decades, urban myths have surrounded the white washed building that makes up Stott Hall Farm and the fields around it. The motorway was built in the s and rumour has it that the farmer it belonged to, Ken Wild, had refused to sell it when plans for the six-lane carriage way were approved. It is believed that planners had to come up with way round the problem and decided to simply build the road round it. Ken had been living there with his we, Beth, and their flock of sheep. But rather than being a rebel who was taking a stand against a huge new motorway, it seems that Ken was nothing of the sort. A documentary, filmed almost  years after the motorway was completed, has revealed the truth about why the farm is in the middle of a motorway. Filmed in  and released a few years ago by the British Film Institute , Cleggaposs People explains why the road could never have been built on the farm. Journalist Michael Clegg explains: A geological fault beneath the farmhouse meant it was more practical for engineers to leave it rather than blast through and destroy it. Outside the noise is relentless but inside it’s as peaceful and cosy as any farmhouse. Ken and his we Beth had moved into the farmhouse in  and always insisted the motorway didnapost bother them. Although Beth did admit it made cleaning harder as the sheer number of cars speeding by meant it could get very dusty. Heartbreakingly though, the couple did witness a few fatal crashes while they were living on the farm. But the nearest they came to disaster was .am one morning when a ft lorry ended up overturned in their yard. Beth explained: “The driver climbed out through the windscreen. He wasn’t hurt at all. Eleven years ago, Jill Falkingham bought the house along with her husband Phil, and the couple moved in with their son, John-William.  They completely renovated the home, which dates back to , and Jill has always insisted itaposs no dferent to living anywhere .“Traffic is very close,” she told  the Manchester Evening News  . “But it’s always windy here, which takes the pollution away.

Research by the Office for National Statisticsfound that the rate of fatalities in poorer areas is double that of their more affluent counterparts. Parts of London, the Midlands and the North East are among the areas with the highest Covid- mortality rates. In the capital, where the disease spread fastest in the early days of the pandemic, four out of  deaths were linked to coronavirus between March  and April . By comparison, the killer bug was mentioned on just % of death certicates in the South West. A new interactive mapallows users to find out the number of deaths per , of the population. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here In London . deaths per , persons was linked to Covid-. Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester, as well as Hertsmere, Salford, Watford, Middlesbrough, Luton, Sandwell and Slough had rates above  deaths per , people. In Wales there were  Covid- deaths during that period - % of all deaths. Figures showed the number of deaths in deprived areas is . per , in England, compared to . in more affluent areas. Nick Stripe, head of health analysis at the Office for National Statisticssaid: “People living in more deprived areas have experienced Covid- mortality rates more than double those living in less deprived areas. General mortality rates are normally higher in more deprived areas, but so far Covid- appears to be taking them higher still.” In Wales, where levels of deprivation are measured dferently to England, the ONS found that the most deprived fth of areas had a Covid- mortality rate of . deaths per , population.  New research shows that Middlesbrough and Walsall have the highest rates of infection in the country - with Wolverhampton, Gateshead and St Helens also among the places where the disease has spread widely. Figures released by the Centre for Progressive Policy this week show that of the  places with the highest infection rates, just one - Luton - is in the south. Labour MP Conor McGinn, who represents St Helens in Merseyside, toldthat the areaaposs industrial past has contributed to high rates of respiratory diseases, as it has an older population. Mr McGinn said: Added to ten years of austerity that has seen huge funding cuts to the council and NHS, it is understandable that places like ours will be badly affected by coronavirus.  When the crisis subsides, there is an urgent need to address the huge health gap across the country, Middlesbroughaposs MP said. The figures show there are  cases per , of the population there, making it the most at-risk place for infections in England.

Doctors did every test you could think of but no one knew what it was.I went from lb to lb in just over a year because whenever I ate the pain just went off the scale, it was indescribable. ‘I was tracking my calories and I was luckyI managed to eat more than  calories a day.

Tori, , and her husband Eddie, , Smith said they were left in hysterics when police pulled their car over in Baltimore, US, to quiz them. While used to getting comments and looks in public, a colleague of Eddieaposs had taken things a step further when he saw them out together in public. The colleague assumed Eddie had kidnapped a teenage girl and expressed his concerns to police. Officers then pulled over Eddie while he was working as a driver, with Tori sitting in the passenger seat. Tori said she was shocked, but tried to explain how she simply appears younger than she actually is. She said: “I often join Eddie while he’s at work because it gets me out of the house, and we love hanging out – evenit is driving around for the day. “But a few weeks ago, we were at the facility waiting for a truck to get loaded and I went to use the bathroom, which is when someone must have spotted me and assumed I was just . “As we went to pull off, two police cars pull up and asked Eddie to step out of the truck – we were so confused. “The cop asked me ‘what is your relationship to that man ’, and I explained he is my husband and asked what was going on, which left us in hysterics.Tori said she showed her ID to a police officer who also started to laugh and apologise. The couple say they are sometimes looked at as a sugar daddy and sugar baby couple - but the couple said they are unfazed by the attention. They met in a karaoke bar and were initially attracted to each other’s looks, as well as sharing a love for singing and travelling. It wasn’t until November , , when the love-struck pair tied the knot and planned to have kids in the future.

A man with great dental health shared the correct way to clean teeth with his we, who was so taken aback by it, she decided to share his top tips with people on social media - and even dentists agreed her partner was on to something. The woman, who posts on the TikTok account @KassySlays, explained how her husband had told her that the key is to start with an alcohol mouth wash, then to floss, then brush your teeth. She said: My husband has been keeping a secret from me, he says that the right way to brush your teeth is to first rinse with an alcohol mouthwash, then to floss, then to brush your teeth and then to use a fluoride rinse. He saysyou do the alcohol mouthwash last itaposll remove the fluoride that you just put on your teeth by brushing them, so you should do it first to kill the germs and then finish off with a whitening fluoride rinse.  She added: Apparently the last time he went to the dentist, the hygienist told him he didnapost even really need a cleaning. I was today years old and Iaposve got terrible teeth. A spokesperson for the British Dental Association confirmed that you should always use mouthwash before brushing your teeth - however they advised against finishing up with a fluoride rinse like in the video. They said: It’s essential to brush teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste for at least two minutes – last thing at night and at one other time.  It’s important to clean all surfaces of the teeth and gently along the gum line. Interdental brushes are better for cleaning the spaces between teeth than floss, except where the space is too tight to insert a brush. Donapost rinse your mouth out after brushing, as it will wash away the fluoride which makes teeth more resistant to tooth decay -aposspit donapost rinseapos.  If you use mouthwash, use it at a dferent time to brushing, otherwise you’ll rinse away the protective effect of fluoride.

The research, carried out on  patients in Spain, aimed to build a picture of how the disease might manest in skin symptoms. Through the Spanish Academy of Dermatology, all Spanish dermatologists were asked to help identy patients who had an unexplained skin eruption in the last two weeks and who had suspected or confirmed Covid-. A standardised questionnaire was used and photos taken of skin conditions to detect patterns of the virusaposs potential effect on the skin. Authors of the study, published in the British Journal of Dermatology, said that in some cases it was hard to tellskin conditions were directly caused by coronavirus or indicated complications. As a result, the public is being urged not to try to self-diagnose Covid- based on skin symptoms, because rashes and lesions are common and hard to dferentiate without medical expertise. Chilblain-like symptoms The study found that in % of its cases chilblain-like symptoms were identied. Described as acral areas of erythema-edema with some vesicles or pustules, these lesions affect the hands and feet and may resemble the small, itchy swellings of chilblains. They are small red or purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin and usually asymmetrical in appearance, the study said. The symptoms were associated with younger patients, lasted for an average of . days, appeared later in the course of Covid- and were associated with less severe cases of the disease. Vesicular eruptions In % of cases, dermatologists identied vesicular eruptions, described as outbreaks of small blisters, commonly itchy, that appeared on the trunk of the body. These could also affect peopleaposs limbs, may be filled with blood, and could become larger or more spread out. They were associated with middle-aged patients, lasted on average . days, appeared more commonly before other symptoms and were associated with intermediate severity of the disease. Urticarial lesions A third condition, identied in % of cases, was named as urticarial lesions, which consist of pink or white raised areas of skin resembling a nettle rash. Known as wheals, these are usually itchy and can be spread across the body, including in a few cases on the palms of hands.  Maculopapules Among % of cases other maculopapules were identied - small, flat and raised red bumps. In some cases these were distributed round hair follicles and had ying degrees of scaling. The study said the appearance was likened to pityriasis rosea, a common skin condition. Blood spots under the skin might also be present, either as spots or dots or on larger areas. Urticarial lesions were found to last an average of . days, while a maculopapular condition lasted on average . days. They usually appeared at the same time as other Covid- symptoms, were associated with more severe Covid- cases, and itching was very common.  Researchers noted that maculopapules and urticarial lesions are common and can have many causes, meaning they may not be a helpful aide for diagnosing Covid-. Livedo or necrosis A fth category of conditions, Livedo or necrosis, was identied by dermatologists in % of cases.

In a new interview, one of the defectors, Ji Seong-ho, said he is  per cent sure that Kim is dead and that the dictatoraposs sister will take control of the country. The balloons were released in Incheon, close to the border, on Thursday night in the hope that the contents will reach villagers in the North and the messages will spread through the secretive and isolated country. Fighters for a Free North Korea is an NGO run by North Koreans who managed to escape the oppressive regime.The leaflets celebrated the election victories of Ji and Thae Yong Ho, who last week told CNN: Iaposm not quite sure whether he [Kim] really had some surgery or whatever, but one thing is clear... he cannot stand up by himself or walk properly.On Friday, Ji said he believes Pyongyang may announce this weekend that the dictator has died and a successor - likely Kimaposs sister Kim Yo-jong - has been chosen. Amid unveried claims that Kim was dead, in a vegetative state, gravely ill or recovering after undergoing heart surgery, the lawmaker said he was informed that Kim died last weekend after undergoing a cardiovascular operation.  North Korea has held off on confirming its leaderaposs demise and announcing a period of mourning because it is grappling with a complicated succession issue, he added.Ji, who won a proportional representation seat in South Koreaaposs elections on April , told Yonhap News Agency: Iaposve wondered how long he could have endured after cardiovascular surgery.Iaposve been informed that Kim died last weekend.

Ji said an announcement could come this weekend and Kimaposs sister is likely to succeed him. He did not reveal the source of his information.

Ji Seong-ho believes Pyongyang may announce this weekend that the dictator has died and a successor - likely Kimaposs sister Kim Yo-jong - has been chosen. Amid unveried claims that Kim was dead, in a vegetative state, gravely ill or recovering after undergoing heart surgery, the lawmaker said he was informed that Kim died last weekend after undergoing a cardiovascular operation. North Korea has held off on confirming its leaderaposs demise and announcing a period of mourning because it is grappling with a complicated succession issue, he added. Kim hasnapost been seen in public since April  - almost three weeks ago - when he oversaw a Politburo meeting. It was claimed he underwent heart surgery the following day. Satellite images show a train parked at the leadership station in the coastal resort of Wonsan for more than a week - suggesting that Kim may be at his luxury compound - but North Korea watchers have cautioned that it could be a ersion tactic. It has also been suggested that Kim may have left Pyongyang to avoid coronavirus, after people close to him caught the killer bug, and is alive and well.  But there have been signs that Kim isnapost making leadership decisions and North Korea has stopped trying to silence the rapid spread of rumours that he has died or is in poor health. Ji, who won a proportional representation seat in South Koreaaposs elections on April , told Yonhap News Agency: Iaposve wondered how long he could have endured after cardiovascular surgery. Iaposve been informed that Kim died last weekend. He added: It is not  per cent certain, but I can say the possibility is  per cent. North Korea is believed to be grappling with a complicated succession issue.  Ji said an announcement could come this weekend and Kimaposs sister is likely to succeed him. He did not reveal the source of his information. Claims about Kim or North Koreaaposs activities are almost impossible to very due to the countryaposs secrecy and isolation. The deaths of Pyongyangaposs only two previous leaders - Kimaposs grandfather Kim Il-sung, the countryaposs founder, and father Kim Jong-il - were announced by state media two days after they had died, triggering mourning periods. South Koreaaposs presidency has insisted that it has not detected any unusual signs in North Korea amid speculation about Kimaposs health and his absence from state media reports. Taiwanaposs intelligence chief, Chiu Kuo-cheng, told lawmakers in Taipei that Kim is sick and North Korea has drawn up contingency plansthe event of a power vacuum. UK Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said America has caught no sight of Kim and is watching reports about his health, adding there was a real risk of famine in the country amid the coronavirus outbreak. Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean diplomat who defected to South Korea, where he is now a lawmaker, recently suggested that Kim has health problems. He told CNN: Iaposm not quite sure whether he really had some surgery or whatever, but one thing is clear... he cannot stand up by himself or walk properly. There has also been speculation that North Korea is preparing to test-fire another missile into the sea. North Koreaaposs propaganda networks have not mentioned anything about Kimaposs health or being absent from public view for weeks, and they continue to report that he is making decisions and sending messages to world leaders.Kimaposs -year-old sister Kim Yo-jong, who is his closest confidant, his uncle Kim Pyong-il, , and his first military chief, Choe Ryong-hae, have been named as possible successorsthe current leader is dead or unable to continue. South Koreaaposs National Assembly Research Services, a legislative think tank, has said that Kimaposs sister has recently been exerting increasing clout in Pyongyang. The think tankaposs report added: This suggests the possibility of expanding her status and role as official successor. However, some observers believe she would be rejected by North Koreaaposs elite and would be passed over because she is a woman. Kim Jong-un, believed to be aged , was groomed to become the countryaposs next leader as his fatheraposs health failed. He is said to have three children, but they are all very young and not in a position to take over the country. With so many wildly ying claims about Kimaposs health and the reason for his absence from public view, the only thing that is certain is no-one outside of North Korea really knows whether he is dead or alive. Experts have said that only a handful of people close to Kim will know the truth.Rumours about Kimaposs health and claims that he has died have been spreading through the country, along with a fake TV news report about his demise, it has been reported. Speculation about Kimaposs health erupted after he missed an annual birthday celebration for his late grandfather - a major date on the calendar in North Korea - on April . It was followed by a report from the Seoul-based website Daily NK, which is run by defectors, that claimed Kim had undergone heart surgery on April . Kimaposs condition was considered stable following the operation and he was recovering at a villa while doctors continued to monitor him, a source inside North Korea told the website.

Despite the campaign finishing nine matches short, we are delighted to announce the   Tele Sport Player of the Year for Dundee.The votes have been cast, averages for players having started  games vied up and there are no worries about emails turning up or not.The   Tele Sport Player of the Year is Paul McGowan for the second year running.After a very strong start, the midfielder’s influence grew throughout the season as the team got to grips with the Championship challenge. As ever, McGowan rarely fell below a seven out of  rating, finishing the season off with an eight after a wonderful assist for Kane Hemmings against Ayr, as well as key displays against Partick and an earlier showing against the Honest Men. After six years at the club, ‘Gowser’ is still going strong in dark blue.Fans favourite, Hemmings, ran McGowan very close with a strong run of form since the middle of December, breaking the -goal barrier in the final match against Ayr. Impressive showings in wins over Dunfermline and Partick in December stand out but his top display came back in October at a chilly Alloa, where the only disappointment was when he fluffed a chance to seal a hat-trick late on.The -year-old was a real star for manager James McPake after he gave him a regular run in the first team at the beginning of the campaign. Such a steady and unflustered player in the middle of the park, Robertson allowed the more experienced players to shine alongside him. That’s not stopped the teenager picking up regular good grades, in particular a fine showing against Dundee United at Tannadice in December.The first signing of the season, former Partick and Ayr winger, McDaid, showed dferent sides to his game last term. When the team struggled to create goalscoring opportunities early on, McDaid was still a regular threat and he’s shown his defensive capabilities more recently as a wing-back. His tackling in the area in derbies may need some work but McDaid will be determined that the best is yet to come from him in dark blue.Undoubtedly a class act in the middle of the park, Scotland international Dorrans showed glimpses of his best form throughout the campaign as he worked himself back to full fitness following y injury issues. The ex-Rangers man grabbed a vital goal at Tannadice in the - derby draw in December and was a driving force throughout.It seems defenders didn’t fare too well in   but make up almost the rest of the top .Honourable mentions go to Jordan McGhee ., Jordon Forster ., Jack Hamilton ., Shaun Byrne . and Jordan Marshall .."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/ce8fb762-b8c4-4e5b-8688-029367394f0b-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/ce8fb762-b8c4-4e5b-8688-029367394f0b-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/ce8fb762-b8c4-4e5b-8688-029367394f0b-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/ce8fb762-b8c4-4e5b-8688-029367394f0b-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee united kids light up premiership gordon forrest","story":"Gordon Forrest has backed Dundee United’s young stars to shine in the Premiership.The Tangerines assistant boss has been hugely impressed with the quality of United’s academy prospects this season.Several have played their part in the Tannadice club’s Championship title-winning campaign.Louis Appere has been the headliner, with Scotland Under- recognition his reward for a stunning debut campaign.Others have made their presence felt in Robbie Neilson’s first team too.But Forrest expects United’s kids to move even further to the fore once United get started in the top flight.He said: “The owners have invested heavily in the academy and the focus will stay on bringing young players through.“We have a few who broke through last season, Louis Appere springs to mind # he had a very good season and got a Scotland U call up.“Declan Glass went out on loan in the first half of the season then played his part when he came back.“And Chris Mochrie too, he’s only sixteen but he got minutes and has a good future ahead of him.“There are others bubbling away in the background too, in that  or -year-old age group, that we think a lot of.“We certainly have a few players who will be there or thereabouts.”When United’s youngsters will get their chance to impress remains to be seen.With no decision yet made on how to conclude the current Premiership season, it’s a waiting game for the Tangerines.Players and staff alike have been placed on furlough leave, with only a few senior workers left in post to run the club through lockdown.It all adds up to a strange way to celebrate winning promotion after four years in the Championship.It’s mission accomplished for United, yet without the certainty of knowing when next season will begin, everything feels strangely unfinished.But as desperate as everyone at Tannadice is to know what’s going to happen next, Forrest insists safety is paramount for players, staff and fans ahead of anyto action.“You could see the way it was heading over the last few weeks,” said the United number two.“There were a lot of s and buts regarding the season starting again and we had a few plans in place depending on what happened.“But once we went on furlough that brings a lot to a halt and you’re looking at the media, the government and the health services.“I think that’s when we realised how distant things were getting – and that was before the vote took place.“We don’t look like we’ll be back training as a group any time soon and the talk now is about fans being able to come to games.“So it’s about the safety aspect now, that’s what’s going to be behind football starting up again.“All we can do is wait for the authorities to make a decision and then plan from there.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.36356327-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.36356327-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.36356327-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.36356327-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"george cran dundee fc email another stalemate","story":"I have a sneaking suspicion Scottish football is heading for another stalemate in the next couple of weeks over reconstruction.We’re all only just getting over the last one, induced by a combination of an over-active email spam folder, John Nelms doing his best Machiavellian impression and some shoddy governance.I have to admit, I’ve never envied the job Neil Doncaster has to do as chief executive of the SPFL – trying to corral  dferent voices into making a sensible decision while acting as a punchbag for all the critics to lay into the dys of our game.I’m not saying he’s blameless but his job does seem to me to consist of taking the blame for everything, whether he has anything to do with it or not.Now Ann Budge of Hearts and Les Gray of Hamilton seem to be enjoying that role as chairs of the reconstruction ‘task force’.Already dissenters are amassing and they’ve not even laid out what possible plans there might be to choose from.I’ve been very much in favour of league reconstruction for a long time now. In my ideal world we’d have at least a -team top flight. I’ve already given up hope of the Premiership clubs agreeing to another other than , however. Sorry, Dundee.My thinking is Nelms’ play over the vote saga was to force reconstruction into happening – I don’t think it’s going to benefit the Dark Blues in the immediate future, however.Next season they should be big favourites in the second tier, though. And a bigger top flight makes it easier to stay up the following season, too.Dundee United, on the other hand, can sit back safe in the knowledge they are a Premiership club no matter what – as long as it’s not a reduced ision, they’ll be happy.A stalemate, though, is brewing, I reckon.Already Budge and Gray have talked up dferent approaches – Hearts want a temporary change while Accies want permanent.Temporary seems pretty pointless to me – that only benefits a handful of clubs, one of them being Hearts. The rest will no doubt shout that down.Now, though, the League Two teams are ganging up on the rest.I have to admire the bolshiness of that, to be honest.They want a -- set-up or nothing. I quite like that idea.Bigger leagues make things more interesting and improve our football.Already, though, clubs higher up the food chain are taking potshots at them.I can’t help but think these are only opening salvos in another departure from sanity from Scottish football.Dundee United are talking of aiming high – that’s exactly what they should be doing.Managing director Mal Brannigan says the club should be targeting the top six and, beyond that,Normally I’d think the manager of a newly-promoted club whose top director had mentioned Europe and trophies would be thinking: #Thanks very much for making my job harder.#However, Robbie Neilson has the same targets at Tannadice and spoke about European football months ago.I like a club to be ambitious and United have enough about them as a club to be a top-six power again.That’s where they were when I moved to Dundee and it didn’t seem like they were punching above their weight.Right now, though, they are far from that level.Fans will like the big talk and they should definitely be allowed to dream.Backing up those words is the hard part, though. I sincerely hope the top dogs at United can do just that –they do, it’ll be some ride at Tannadice.ARSENAL have begun training again and the English Premier League have launched ‘Project Restart’.With England – and particularly London – hit worse by the coronavirus than we are up here, I find it strange to see clubs and leagues ing back into things so quickly.I desperately want to see football back as soon as possible but there needs to be awareness that it looks like one rule for rich footballers and another for the rest of us.FIFA are talking about allowing five subs per team to ease congestion when the game kicks off again. Fair enough but I don’t want to see that as the norm going forward.

Then I realised it wasn’t a good thing, it wasn’t like a holiday.Our last day of school was kinda the same as any other but we did a Bunny Drive and the teacher did a lot of sorting out on how we were going to do our schoolwork online. The teacher even gave us a Creme Egg at the end of the day.Lessons online is dferent and it took some time getting used to but now it feels normal. Sometimes I enjoy doing my work on the computer but others not so much. Although my typing has improved!Being stuck at home for a long time is quite annoying and sad, especially when I can’t see my family that isn’t my Mum, Dad and sister. I miss my Grandma and Papa most, not being able to see them is sad because I used to see them at least once a week. My little sister Amber has got me into doing Tik Toks even Mum wants to make a Tik Tok.

Evelyn died as a result of Covid- and a pulmonary embolism.Nurses at ARI arranged for four separate video calls between Evelyn and her family, with daughter Emma Rothwell, , praising their efforts as “wonderful”.Emma, who lives in Westhill, received a phone call from the hospital three days after her mum was admitted.She said: “She had been making some progress and we were quite optimistic about her chances.“It was a real rollercoaster. We thought she was going to get better and then she took a bit of a turn for the worse.” vw, px\"  Peterhead born and raised, Evelyn was a devoted we to husband Charles, , and they spent  years of their lives together.Emma said: “They were such wonderful friends and they did fight, but it was a perfect partnership.“My dad is just lost without his best friend right now.”The couple had two children, Emma and Craig, .She said: “My mum lived for her family and she was very family orientated.“She had myself and my brother, who has Down’s syndrome.“He’s in supported accommodation at the moment and so we haven’t been able to give him a cuddle since this started.“He’s finding it quite hard to be without his mum who’s been there all his le.”Evelyn was also a loving grandmother to Emma’s children, Cameron, seven, and Jamie, four.She said: “Both my boys loved their grandma. They had her wrapped around their little fingers – she would have done anything for them.”In her youth, Evelyn was a TSB relief bank manager, going up and down the country’s banks. She gave up her job when Craig was born to become a full-time mum.A natural care-giver, she gravitated towards helping others and was involved in guiding throughout her le, with most recent appointments including Division Commissioner with Banff and Buchan Forties Division and Assistant Guider with th Peterhead Brownies. She was an active member of the local Trefoil Guild after retiring from units, and was also involved with St Andrew’s Church in Peterhead.In hospital, a CT scan revealed that Evelyn had a pulmonary embolism. While a doctor kneeled on the floor at her bedside, to deliver the news that she would be taken to ICU, Evelyn could still only think of others.Emma said: “She was about to be transferred to intensive care, but she was worried about the doctor getting sore knees. That’s the kind of person she was.”Emma’s husband, Robert Rothwell, drove to Peterhead to drop an iPad to Evelyn’s husband and sister, Lorna Corsar, , so they could speak to her one last time.Separated but connected, Emma says the situation felt unnatural. She said: “You just want to go to the person and be able to hug them.“You want to give them all the love you can and it just felt so wrong that we weren’t allowed to do that, or hold her hand or give her a kiss.“So it was a godsend when they said we could at least have a video call.”On Sunday April , five days after Evelyn was admitted, the family received an update on her condition.Emma was askedshe would like to call in one last time.She said: “She kept on fighting and I was able to be with her for three hours until she took her last breath.“The staff were absolutely super. I think it was a new piece of tech for some of the nurses, but they were so wonderful. They wanted everything to be right for us.”In particular, Emma credits the efforts of one staff nurse, Lorraine, who was at Evelyn’s side in place of her family.She said: “The nurse who was with my mum at the end was just outstanding.“She was so attentive and she hoped that because it was my voice mum was hearing, that she maybe thought it was me holding her hand and stroking her head.“She called it a privilege to have been there.”A Just Giving page in Evelyn’s honour has raised £, with all proceeds going towards a new staff garden at ARI.The garden will offer frontline workers a safe and peaceful retreat from the stresses of their job.Emma said: “The emotional toll on those staff must be so immense.“They need that space and time for reflection. I saw how attentive they were to mum and it was just wonderful.”Evelyn was known for her generosity and Emma believes the fundraiser is the perfect tribute to her mum.She said: “My mum’s fought breast cancer. She’s had two hip replacements, three knee replacements and she’s not had an easy le, but her priority was never herself.“Her priority was always her family and looking out for others.”To donate to the fundraiser, go to justgiving fundraising evelynbrown"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 9 niblicks spoons and touchscreen carts","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Times BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things Golf are  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre.We have another question from #Our Listener# and we have more stats and golfing news.Martyn#s Monday Club got a surprise when they saw Oban#s golf prodigy Bob MacIntyre sporting their logo on his kit bag last week.Reporter Kathie Grfiths  catches  up with one of the # founding fathers# #  Robert Cruickshanks# of #Martyn#s Monday Club#  to find out what Bob#s support means to them.Since thriving Martyn#s Monday Club started-up, creating a safe place for both men and women to talk about their struggles,  lives have been saved and there will be more says Mr Cruickshanks  whose own son took his le in .Now there are hopes to meet up with Bob and invite him to be an ambassador.https:www.facebook martynsmondayclub Play or download the episode in the link below"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The beauty and calm of the island made a lasting impression on me.#The monuments of Kilmartin Glen are also at the very heart of the book’s major themes, including kingship and the sacredness of landscape.#And it was at Dunadd that Aidan would have seen the kings of Dál RiataPortals to this other-world still survive, suggested by mountains, forgotten ruins, holy wells and standing stones, crosses and caves, said Mr Connell.Born in Newcastle, he now lives in Cumbria, England, with his partner and their daughter.He previously worked for titles including The Edinburgh Evening News, with bylines in The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday.The book has been published by Culture and Democracy Press and is available to purchase online through Amazon for £."},{"url":null,"title":"national theatre announces new digital programming","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe National Theatre has announced the next two productions to be streamed live on YouTube every Thursday at pm.The screenings are part of National Theatre at Home the new initiative to bring content to the public accessed from their homes during coronavirus.Productions announced today include the NT Live broadcast of Danny Boyle’s production of Frankenstein filmed at the National Theatre in , which sees Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller alternating the roles of Victor Frankenstein and his creation.

We have three dogs and three cats in foster that were in place before the lockdown. We are trying to support them as much as possible.\"Unfortunately, the lockdown means that we cannot re-home any animals at this time. We had people lined up to come and meet two of the dogs on the week that the country went into lockdown and had to cancel their appointments due to this.\"Also, Pal, who has been waiting for over a year for a new home, was due to go away to his new home that week which has had to be put on hold. And we have no idea when he can finally go to his new home.\"And the centre isnt just coping with the stress of caring for the animals during a crisis, theyre also facing potential financial strain as the weeks progress.\"Our centre relies heavily on income generated from our four shops,\" added Lee-Ann. \"Seventy per cent of our annual income is generated via the shops so loss of income is a real concern.\"We have had to cancel fundraising events during the key fundraising period of spring summer. This includes our Annual Dog Show in May which is one our biggest fundraising events.\"We are hopeful that not all staff go down with virus at same time.\"We are managing the situation to the best of our ability and [despite] that our weekly income has reduced very signicantly, and we need people to donate to help keep our centre operational whilst our shops are closed.\"All our animals are still being looked after and cared for by our excellent and committed staff.\"Sonia Graham from Borders Greyhound Rescue added: \"Were trying to make the best of the situation.\"We have  dogs at the moment because we cant get dogs in or out. Its dficult.\"Weve had some under fostering, but unless they are greyhound people they wont be going to foster.\"Its frustrating because for people who want dogs, youd think this was the perfect time to have one as theres time for one-on-one training.\"And a lack of volunteers is a key factor in the dficulties facing the Greyhound Rescue now, with the charity normally taking in up to  regular helpers to care for  dogs.\"Without volunteers, its been a real struggle,\" said Sonia. \"Were family-run and we have a farm too, so were just trying to fill the gaps left by volunteers.\"Another problem which has reared its head for Sonia and her family is the knock-on effect of this lockdown.Sonia explained: \"People who may have lost jobs or their business, they wont be thinking of taking on an animal.\"People cant afford to pay vet bills. I can see this being a dficult year.\"If anything, we may see animals being handed in. People will misjudge and panic about the situation. And it wont just be dogs being brought to rescues but being dumped.\"It will be interesting to see how this all works out.\"And to help ease the strain on the rescue, Sonia has created an Amazon wishlist for donations to help keep the dogs fed.The wishlist gives donors the option to either donate physical items, such as a bag of food, or they can gt a cash amount straight into the Greyhound Rescues account to spent on vital products.On the other hand, the Arthurshiel Rescue Centre, in St Boswells, hasnt seen an increase in their four-legged residents, with the charity manager Shona Middlemass saying: \"Were managing fine\".She added: \"Weve not had an influx of animals, any strays that get raised with us we share over Facebook.\"Fingers crossed everything keeps going smoothly, weve not had any problems.\"We dont have any cash coming in.

He is now coming to the end of his sixth year.The -year-old, whose mother is Catholic, had always had the inclination to become a priest, even applying to train before, but for reasons-unknown never followed up on these applications.It wasnt untilgoing to confession in Melbourne in , not long after the passing of his father two years earlier, that he started seeing a path to priesthood laid out clearly in front of him ndash particularly thanks to guidance from his own parish-priest in Galashiels.When we spoke to Bobby, who is back in Galashiels, he told us: \"Since filming ended, the most visible thing thats changed is that when were in Rome now were wearing collars.

The school has an approximate  percent drop-out rate as the young men learn more of what God is calling them to do, and as they face the sometimes hard-to-accept vows which they must take.\"Every guy is dferent,\" said Bobby. \"To be honest, Im not  percent sure  percent is the rate of drop out Ive experienced over the past few years Ive been there. Theres only been two or three guys out of - whove left.\"Me, personally, my first year was probably my toughest year. It was a big adjustment from that freedom I had, and having gone from earning quite a healthy wage working at sea, then going to seminary in a foreign country ndash it was quite a challenge.\"There was a period where I did have to really, seriously, pray about it and think about what I was being called to do.\"I think everybody goes through it, and I think its a good thing that everybody goes through because ultimately thats what seminary is about.,params: .push\"Seven years isnt a number plucked out of mid-air, its a period where youre doing a lot of study but youre also doing a lot of work to understand what it is youre being called to do, andits being called to priesthood because its not a light undertaking, its quite a serious undertaking ndash but a good one, and a positive one.\"And the problems facing Bobby and his fellow seminarians have only grown since the COVID- lockdown.He added: \"From about six weeks ago being in Rome and studying in the university with my class of about  other guys, Im now sitting in a dining room in a Catholic church house in Galashiels studying on my own.\"So things have changed quite a bit. But study still continues, its not like theyve stopped. Theres been a couple of weeks, this week and last week, which would have been the Easter holidays anyway.\"Although we may be spread out, back to our home countries, were still persevering with study.\"And in June, Bobby hopes to sit his exams which will see him move into his seventh year at the Scots College.

outbreak.It is estimated that the public is collectively owed about pound billion from travel firms.Forced instead to turn to their banks for help, many customers have now been told they are not eligible for a refund.Heres what you need to know.Why arenrsquot travel firms giving refunds Consumer watchdog Which  recently revealed that  of the UKrsquos largest airlines and travel firms are illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions.

into it.I found a little information about it.It was located in Dam Brae and was said to contain water with special qualities that helped make a perfect pot of tea.There is little explanation as to what exactly these qualities were, but it seems to have been widely believed and accepted in the past.Tea, of course, became popular in Scotland, and by the th century it had become an important accompaniment to the often mundane diet of working class people, providing a refreshing non-alcoholic alternative to beer.For the poor, tea drinking wasnrsquot linked to formal social rituals as it was with the upper classes.Tea was the drink of the working class as they worked.So, a well in the heart of the town which was believed to supply good tea making water will have been a busy and popular place.Many people, likely mostly women, would have congregated around the well.In the OS name book from the s, it was clearly recorded that the well was listed as the ldquoVickerrsquos Well, but then goes on to state that ldquono person in the locality knows it by that name.Everyone called it ldquothe bickers well.Perhaps this was a result of local dialect changing the name over time.But Paul Bennet, in his interesting website ldquoThe Northern Antiquarian says ldquothere is the obvious possibility that the ldquobickers ndash as in chit-chat and gossip ndash related to it being where local folk simply met and chatted.Perhaps the reputation of the wellrsquos water for making quality tea also meant people from further afield considered it worthwhile to detour here, in order to make that extra special ldquoBickerrsquos Brew.One account says it was once surrounded by old trees.All of this conjures an image of an important social meeting place, with people meeting under the shade of old trees, exchanging views and information and having a good blether while they wait their turn to draw water from the celebrated well.Was the belief in the goodness of the water rooted in some older tradition Perhaps it was a revered holy well, as some have suggested It seems to have been associated with the vicarage of St Michaels nearby, which roots the well in Musselburghrsquos ancient past, and gives a reason for the name Vicarrsquos Well.The well was replaced by a pump sometime in the nineteenth century, and then was blocked up, and became forgotten.When Irsquod discovered all this I set out to find the location of the well to seethere was still any evidence of it.Dam Brae is now named Kilwinning Place and I studied a nineteenth century map which marked the exact location of the well, then compared it to a modern one and set out on my quest.I found the location. Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"winton-brewery-takes-countys-micropub","story":"Steve Holligan and David Mackinnon, from Winton Brewery, stepped behind the bar at Dunbarrsquos Station Yard Micropub at the beginning of the month.Currently, the duo are only allowed to sell off-sales, due to the coronavirus lockdown preventing customers from entering the pub, but they were looking forward to once again welcoming people inside as soon as possible.Steve said: ldquoWersquove been looking for a while to find something like this.ldquoThe Station Yard is unbelievable.ldquoWe looked in Haddington, we looked in Gullane and we wanted to stay in East Lothian, where we are from and where the brewery is based.ldquoIt was one of those things where you were scrolling through Facebook and this popped up.ldquoIt was too good an opportunity and we got in touch with Gerard McPhillips [who had created the pub alongside his late business partner David McGee] and had a really good meeting with him.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

I gained a great deal of confidence in terms of Gaelic grammar, spelling and writing, all of which has been invaluable in my working le.BBC weather presenter, Joy Dunlop, is another graduate of the college who says the fluency in Gaelic she developed at the college has given her many opportunities that she otherwise would not have had.She studied Gaelic as a second language when she was a pupil at Oban High School then decided to do her sixth year at the college. She initially planned to stay for just one year to do the Cugraversa Comais but loved it so much she stayed for four, graduating with a BAin Cagravenan agus Cultar na Gagraveidhlig .ldquoAttending Sabhal Mograver was a revelation for me, she says. ldquoThe education I received was unparalleled.ldquoThe personal support and guidance I received from all the staff was of the highest level and I always felt that our teachers were genuinely invested in both the language itself and our progress.ldquoBeing immersed in the language is definitely the best way to learn, dficult as it could be at times, and having the opportunity to speak Gaelic in both the classes and the community was a real help to me.ldquoSimply,you genuinely want to learn Gaelic, there is no better place to do so than Sabhal Mograver Ostaig.

Instead, the site suggests mixing it with green tea as a natural toner.Should you be missing the skin-smoothing effect of an eye-watering beauty salon chemical peel, you may want to follow the online sitersquos alternative: granulated sugar, mixed with olive oil then a right good rub.For those who can spare some beer, its yeast content will help fight excessive sebum production and the bacteria that causes acne.Mix with egg whites and mashed strawberries then use as a face pack ndash or just pretend itrsquos a beery kind of meringue and eat it.While the websitersquos store cupboard treatments may seem a shade desperate, according to Claire Gray of Glasgow-based skincare specialist Ermana, there is real merit in seeking out a more natural approach to our skincare regimes.ldquoAt the moment, most of us are focused on shopping for essentials such as food and medicine, and skincare is often viewed as a luxury product, she says.ldquoBut all this time indoors and washing our hands is having an impact on our skin.For eyes strained from peering too long at Tiger King on Netflix, she has an age-old remedy: ldquoThe tannins in tea can help reduce puffiness and get rid of dark circles.

Rub it on, leave for a few minutes and rinse off.Gray suggests therersquos even a skincare use for that bottle of apple cider vinegar lurking at the back of the cupboard. ldquoThe main ingredient in apple cider vinegar is acetic acid but it also contains lots of other natural alpha-hydroxy acids, she says.ldquoThese work together to gently exfoliate the skin by dissolving dead skin cells. Applying apple cider vinegar to the skin also delivers beneficial enzymes, proteins and good bacteria.With hand-washing a national hobby, she suggests taking particular care when choosing which soaps to buy.ldquoHandwashes contain water and any product with water has preservatives to stop it degrading.

Some are lonely, others not. They live in dferent parts of the country, come from dferent socio-economic backgrounds, have dferent desires and goals.So why are they being treated as one homogenous, vulnerable group, and condemned to an indefinite lockdown While it looks like those of us aged  and under may soon be allowed to restart our lives as part of the lockdown exit plan ndash albeit cautiously and while following social distancing measures ndash it seems the over-s may be told by the Scottish and UK governments to keep self-isolating for up to  months. Maybe longer.Such a blanket policy surely has ageism at its core, regardless of how well-intentioned. How  do you explain the assumption that everyone over the age of  is weak and incapable of making decisions about their own health and wellbeing The evidence from UK Covid- wards suggests the average age of a critically ill patient is . Nine out of  have underlying conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity or type  diabetes. We also know, of course, this cruel illness can afflict, sometimes kill, young and fit people.Until a vaccine is widely available ndash an endeavour scientists believe may take  months or more ndash many people with underlying health conditions of every age group will obviously want to take maximum care and precautions to prevent exposing themselves to danger. They accept, hard as it may be, that they wonrsquot be able to leave home. Others wonrsquot have the mental capacity to make these decisions for themselves.But what about over-s that are fitter, healthier and more active than their younger relatives and friends  And what about older people who do suffer from underlying health problems but would rather take a dferent approach once restrictions start to be lted They may decide it is worth leaving home, spending time with grandchildren and friends, going shopping, evenit means an increased chance of catching the virus. They may be willing to accept the associated risks and consequences.Whatrsquos so galling is the idea that no-one over  can or should decide for themselves what risks they are willing to take with their own health and wellbeing.One of most interesting aspects of this crisis has been the way it has forced all of us to examine and question what makes le worth living. Many of us, myself included, will have come to the conclusion that social contact, time spent with other human beings, is the most precious thing in our lives.This is certainly the case for most of the older folk I speak tonow, especially those who have lost their partner and or live alone. Spending time with children, grandchildren, siblings and pals is what keeps them going. It doesnrsquot take a PhD in psychology to work out that Skype and Zoom will only suffice for so long.I was walking in an empty Glasgow city centre recently and the saddest thing of all was the absence of the cheery bands of elderly ladies and gents that usually frequent Sauchiehall Street on week days, comparing prices and purchases, enjoying a cuppa and a scone, or a pint. The thought of them home alone indefinitely, stoic as they may be, is heartbreaking. For some in care homes, extended isolation will be torturous.Itrsquos one thing ordering people to live without friends and family for a few weeks. Itrsquos something  entirely telling them to do so for months, maybe years. Even for their own good. Some, especially those in the autumn of their lives, may understandably decide it is a sacrice they are not willing to make.There has been much talk recently about treating people like adults. This must include the over-s, who, letrsquos face it, have been grown up for longer than anybody .To be clear, I am not advocating reckless breaking of current lockdown rules. Irsquom saying we need a sensible approach to what comes next, one that doesnrsquot discriminate against the elderly. One that ensures le is still worth living.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

The idea is for local volunteers to wear them when delivering prescriptions, or shopping, or checking to seepeople are okay. Presumably itrsquos so householders know, at half a milersquos distance, that the person staggering up the street laden with parcels is not a random stranger intending to shower them with unwanted muesli or medication.Since my involvement entails nothing more than a bit of light shopping for a few folk, most of whom live within yards of my front door, therersquos no need for anything official or officious. To don a sherbet lemon jacket when dropping off asparagus or cornflakes would be to turn into Captain Mainwaring, with clipboard and pointer under arm. There is, nevertheless, a childish thrill in knowing Irsquove got one should I need it. In theory, now that I have the wherewithal to be fluorescent, I could redirect traffic around a pot-hole or dig up the village green in search of drains, looking qualied to deal with any civic emergency that might arise.It was the French who imbued the gilet jaune with anarchist chic, which is no mean feat. Mine was designed with a burly bloke in mind, and seems to have seen a bit of the world already. All the better, in this hand-me-down era, where spanking new is frowned upon as frivolous. In the sht towards thrt, baggy and shabby earn extra Brownie points.From clachans to city centres, big-hearted armies across the entire country are organising rotas, filling in spreadsheets, and helping out to make sure those in greatest need or isolation do not feel abandoned or helpless. The spirit of kindness this pandemic has stirred is humbling. Wersquove always liked to think of ourselves as a caring nation ndash not always with reason ndash but seeing the range of ways in which theory is being put into practice is eye-opening. This will have far-reaching consequences, some of which, I suspect, will reverberate long after lockdown. Not the least of these is discovering how many are eager to be pressed into service, and what they can achieve when marshalled.None of us knows how long more vulnerable members of society will be asked to stay home. What is increasingly clear, though, is that while the sort of helpful domestic support going on now will be finite ndash even , for some, the necessity of relying on others makes it feel never-ending ndash informal community involvement on several fronts will continue to be important, and perhaps even essential, in the coming years.Long before the present situation, a crack squad of citizen gardeners had taken it upon themselves to turn our nearest town into an outpost of Kew gardens. Others put up Christmas decorations, or tend the tubs and raised beds at the train station, keeping plants on the concourse thriving across the seasons. There are iniduals, meanwhile, who go out in all weathers with litter pickers and refuse bags. They clear the verges and river banks of crisp-packets, plastic bottles, cans, takeaway cartons and all the detritus ditched by those who shouldknow better. Thanks to them, wildle and livestock are safer, burns cleaner, the undergrowth no longer unsightly and depressing.Irsquove always been intrigued by those who donrsquot feel their patch ends where their property meets the pavement. For such folk, the mental map of where their obligation or responsibility lies stretches far beyond the obvious bounds of self-interest. Most of us like to keep our own house in order, but those who are outward-looking are protective of a much wider area. The same goes for helping others. For some, the family circle is as far as their antennae reach. Others respond to those in need whom theyrsquove never met, or ndash through charitable giving especially ndash whose names theyrsquoll never know.Who can say what state the economy will be in when this virus goes into retreat, nor how long it will take to recover. None of the predictions makes cheerful reading, so it seems reasonable to assume that, for a period at least, there will not be an abundance of cash in council coffers. They were hardly overflowing a year ago but with the likelihood of a serious fiscal downturn, shoestring budgets will grow even more threadbare.Around these parts, people are stepping up, not just to collect refuse or plant bulbs by the roadside, but to mow communal areas of grass, strim embankments and de-litter waterways and bridlepaths. You could say that most of this is the councilrsquos responsibility, and yoursquod be right. At a certain point, however, it becomes a pernicious and self-defeating outlook always to expect others to get things done when you could simply get up and do it yourself.So, while this is not intended to suggest letting local government off the hook, whenever essential services come under threat ndash rural buses and post offices, libraries, care packages ndash those of us with time, imagination and inclination can surely help plug the gap, evenonly in the short-term.Thanks to the current volunteer force, I foresee a future when, with the memory of Covid  fading, initiatives intended to get us through this emergency will live on and help communities flourish. After all, the benefits are not solely for those who at the receiving end. Helpers get the immense satisfaction of knowing they are being useful.

Only last week the UK Government delivered a further pound million for Scottish local government. This is money that should be urgently handed over to our struggling councils.These lelines come in addition to the billions of pounds being given by the UK Government to Scottish workers who would otherwise have lost their jobs or incomes as a result of the Covid- economic shakedown. Other support includes the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, the deferment of VAT and income tax payments, and a statutory sick pay relief package.Additionally, the British Army has been drafted in to assist with the response and relief effort.This unprecedented intervention was only achievable because it rests on the strong shoulders of the Union. The reality is that an independent Scotland would have buckled and collapsed had it faced the Covid- crisis alone. With tough times ahead, it would therefore be catastrophic economically for Scotland to go it alone by cutting itself adrt from the UK, which is the sixth-largest economy in the world.Even before the current Covid- crisis, the -page Growth Commission, led by economist and former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, predicted, in , that independence would cause years of austerity for Scotland.While therefore the SNP remain entitled to make an emotional case for independence, even its most diehard supporters must now concede that they have lost the economic argument.The Covid- crisis reinforces the point that independence remains an SNP pipedream which Scotland simply cannot afford.Tim Jackson, Gullane.HOW very sad that we are in a position where the UK cannot speak as one during the coronavirus crisis and factions have opened up ndash all leading to confusion and exacerbating our already-fractured society.We should have one source of advice from the Sovereign Government and forget about petty political point-scoring.Douglas Cowe, Newmachar.HOW sad to see the pandemic stats from other countries similar to our own and realise that their death toll is a fraction of what we have here.If only we had been a bit braver at the referendum, how many lives could have been saved.Robert Drummond, Glasgow G.IT is disappointing that a politician of the stature of former Labour MP for Maryhill, Maria Fyfe, should seize upon the distortion by some sections of the press, who took out of context Nicola Sturgeons reply to a question about whether she would consider closing the border between Scotland and England Ms Sturgeon replied \"I dont have the power to close borders, but these are discussions of course we want to continue to have with the UK government\", referring to the UKs international borders .It is understandable that Ms Fyfe and Labour in Scotland should feel sore at the SNP Ms Fyfes former seat is now represented by an SNP MP, as indeed is every constituency in Glasgow, and Labour holds but one seat in Scotland however it only has itself to blame for the mortying mess in which it finds itself.

There has been an increase, in some parts of the country, in road traffic by as much as  per cent. Last weekend in my local park, the sun out and the sky an enamel blue, it was like any summer weekend of picknickers, sunbathers and folk passing on paths shoulder to shoulder.Nicola Sturgeon, in yesterdays daily briefing, put the increase in vehicle journeys down to a straining against lockdown conditions. \"You might feel you deserve it,\" she said, \"After weeks of restraint. Believe me, I really understand all of that.\"Were at around six weeks now and people are missing people, people are missing the things they previously took for granted. They have kept up with social distancing and washed their hands until the skin began to chafe. Tempers are also chafing.Some are in strict adherence to the guidance. Others have let their guard down as times gone on. These two groups dont make for a good mix.And so to face masks. The First Minister this week made the suggestion that citizens might like to cover their mouth and nose when they go to places where a higher volume of people make social distancing dficult, for example at the supermarket or local shops, or on public transport.Just a recommendation, nothing compulsory. That could have been that, but no.The advice until now has been that masks make very little dference and are not recommended. Jason Leitch, the governments National Clinical Director, only at the beginning of April was very clear that wearing masks was not the right way forward.But, as Professor Leitch pointed out, we are in a rapidly changing situation and advice, too, will rapidly change. The issue was not helped by Professor Hugh Pennington appearing on radio and television to say that face coverings are \"very poor\" and offer \"little protection\".Waters were further muddied by constitutional grumbles, at Holyrood splitting in a dferent direction to Westminster. ITVs political reporter was given short shrt when asking Ms Sturgeonthe conflicting advice north and south of the border would be confusing.\"Are you reporting on confusion,\" she lobbed at Peter MacMahon, \"Or are you actually helping to cause confusion \"The wearing of face coverings is a seemingly straightforward piece of advice and not compulsory, so you can sympathise with frustrations over what turned into a protracted discussion.At the same time, the public is being asked to absorb an entirely new lexicon and, for those of us with no science background at all, weigh up entirely new information and come to a choice that, were told, could save lives. Or increase the death rate.There is clearly a moral pressure there for iniduals to do the right thing by making the right choice - and a societal pressure. It was mere weeks ago that we started talking about social distancing and now it has become part of the language asit had always been common parlance.Now were reading about aerosol transmission, hearing about small scale studies into face coverings, being given conflicting advice from prominent scientists then being told we shouldnt feel confused.There are countless suggestions for how best to wear a face covering. how to make them, the best materials to use, how to wear them and how to safely dispose of them. Its a lot of information to process.At the supermarket on Wednesday, I saw no one wearing homespun face coverings and three people wearing medical-style masks. Its obviously a small sample size but the message didnt seem to have immediately prompted action.However, the response I saw online to the suggestion of face coverings was that,its possible they might make some small positive change, people should wear them.Its not the time for widespread public debates about conflicting studies and is the time for unity and collective action. If there is small gain and no loss, then its dficult to argue against getting on board.However, that takes us back to fraying tempers. Bruce Adamson, the children and young peoplersquos commissioner for Scotland, along with a coalition of charities, has written to supermarkets to ask that parents with children are not turned away or shamed by staff when they go for groceries. Increasing numbers of parents are reporting being told to leave their children in the car or being verbally abused by other shoppers.This shows no empathy or understanding for single parents. Or, of course, couples where one is ill, a key worker, or caring for a disabled child at home, and etc.Face coverings risk becoming another cause for friction in public places. Some people will weigh up the pros and cons and choose not to. But not everyone will be able to wear masks - people with autism may struggle, those who are claustrophobic, people with asthma.For deaf people, other people wearing masks makes communication more dficult or even impossible. It can be exhausting for lip readers, for example, to be on high alert constantly to what happening around them.There needs to be an element of trust to our public interactions. We may feel we are doing a better job then those around us of sticking to the rules but there are many invisible barriers that force other people to make choices we may view as wrong.Perhaps instead of rushing to berate someone who skips a queue or walks in your path, consider they might not know youre there. Before shouting at a mother and child in the supermarket, imagine she might prefer her child to be almost anywhere  than in a public place in a pandemic.Were being asked to make personal decisions with the collective good in mind. Some people are careless and selfish but most people are trying their best so empathy, please, for those whose choices dfer from yours.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Amor estimates the crater resulting from the impact spans almost nine miles in , with a depth of around . miles ndash making it the biggest ever astral collision ever discovered in the UK.Experts believe meteorite strikes were relatively common billions of years ago, as Earth and other planets were pelted with debris left over from the formation of the solar system.Amor says the new research marks such an exciting discovery because impact craters typically erode over time.ldquoIt was purely by chance that this one landed in an ancient rt valley where fresh sediment quickly covered the debris to preserve it, he states.Now that the craterrsquos possible location has been discovered, scientists aim to conduct targeted, D geophysical surveys of the Minch Basin.High-resolution surveys could help the research team get a better sense of the dimensions of the crater - and might even have important implications for other celestial bodieswe learn more about their composition and trajectory.ldquoImpact craters on Earth are exceedingly rare, Amor said. ldquoThe better we can understand how they formed the better we can understand observations on the rocky planets and moons of the solar system.--------------------------------------------------Space enthusiasts get ready to rockGlasgow academics call for volunteers to help collect meteorites as part of UK Fireball NetworkSCOTTISH scientists are turning their eyes to the skies to track meteorites ndash smaller, less threatening iations of their asteroid cousins - before they land on UK soil and want volunteers to help recover the space rocks wherever they fall.The UK Fireball Network, led by researchers from the University of Glasgow and Imperial College London is setting out to place  cameras across the country to catch glimpses of the spectacular natural firework displays caused when meteoroids enter the Earthrsquos atmosphere.It is part of a wider network called the Global Fireball Observatory operated by researchers in Australia at Curtin University.Earlier this year in February, the networkrsquos cameras filmed their first fireball, which dropped meteorites into the North Sea.SKYFALL:Volunteers will help scientists search for traces of meteorites which have been tracked on camera.While those are impossible to recover, the network team expect that future sightings that fall on the UK landmass can be properly triangulated to determine a landing area and send out a search party to find future meteorites.Dr Luke Daly, of the University of Glasgowrsquos School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, is one of the leaders of the UK Fireball Network. He said: ldquoMeteorites provide scientists with invaluable insights into other planets and our solar system. A good deal of what we know about the surface of Mars, for example, comes from analysis of chunks of the planet which were blasted off its surface by asteroid impacts millions of years ago and drted in space before falling to Earth.ldquoMeteorites enter our atmosphere all the time, but the UK hasnrsquot had a great track record of finding them ndash in fact, itrsquos been nearly  years since one was last seen dropping into a back garden in Glatton in Cambridgeshire, and more than  since one was observed in Scotland.ldquoCamera networks like ours, and those of partner organisations like UKMON and SCAMP, give us a great chance to capture fireballs on multiple cameras.ldquoTogether we are building an integrated pipeline to use all the data from all the networks to track fireballs called the UK Fireball Alliance.ldquoIt was very exciting to capture our first images of a fireball caught by two of our observatories, although it was obviously disappointing that the material it dropped fell into the sea.ldquoWhen we do catch sight of a fireball dropping meteorites on land, wersquoll need the help of volunteers to help comb the countryside to find them, so anyone interested in making a little bit of history by getting involved can follow us on Twitter at @FireballsUK."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-zoo-launches-lion-webcam-thank-supporters","story":"The webcam gives viewers the chance to see the wildle conservation charityrsquos eight-month-old Asiatic lion cubs from home.The lsquolion camrsquo will also help to raise awareness of the threats faced by this endangered species in the wild - which population estimates for the Asiatic lions range from merely  -  iniduals.:Coronavirus: Boris Johnson promises lsquocomprehensive planrsquo on easing lockdownAfter closing its doors to visitors in March, the zoo is relying on the support of animal lovers to raise enough money to pay its pound, monthly food bill.Alison Maclean, animal team leader at Edinburgh Zoo said: ldquoWe are so grateful for the support wersquove had so far and wanted to do something to thank everyone for raising enough money to feed our animals in April.\"Almost all of our income comes from our visitors and our food bill alone is pound, every month so it is a challenging time for our charity.

In challenging circumstances, however, they are not helped by supply chains that are simply not operating fairly or equitably.“During a recent conference call with the cabinet secretary and islands minister, I raised concerns about the behaviour of some suppliers towards our island communities. It was a call echoed by MSP and MP colleagues from across the parties.“Unfortunately, two weeks on and shop owners and local wholesalers, who also supply our care homes and hospital, tell me little has changed. If anything, the situation is getting more serious.“I welcome Fergus Ewing’s recognition of the problem and the action he has taken in writing to  of the main suppliers. However, these efforts must now be redoubled as we need to see a dference on the ground.The Orkney MSP added: “At a time of crisis, getting access to food and essential items should not be a postcode lottery. Supply chains should be working in the interests of the entire population, and suppliers should be treating island wholesalers with fairness”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration.

This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property.

Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels.

Yes. But let#s see Alastair also advocate thoroughly for zero hours workers, for parents living in temporary accommodation, for children who are feed from food banks, for people who are now, and who will shortly be living beyond their means,and for the increasing number of people who cannot meet their basic needs. A Universal Basic Income is fundamentally a liberal idea, in as much as people have entitlemment to be spared unreasonable harm. Sowe were to use existing systems to support iniduals, in a responsive and responsible way, possibly at a lower cost than the support now being offered for businesses, we would secure immediate economic stimulus, prevent unreasonable hardship, rebalance the playing field and limit damage to future generations. A heap of thinking has gone into the idea of what rights we each ought to enjoy, the things we should freely have, like affordable transport, and the things we should have the freedom to escape, like hunger. Now is a useful time to be considering such issues, the better for all.An interesting idea, Peter, and one which it may surprise you to learn was looked atseveral years ago by WIr Shetland as a possible policy option for Shetland autonomy.At the time, no country in the world had adopted it however FInland was planning to run a pilot project which it was decided to monitor. I am no longer involved and cannot comment on the current WS situation or policy.After a short, two year trial, the Finnish government decided to end the scheme last year and was reportedly considering alternatives such as a universal credit scheme, similar to that of the UK .Pleased that our MP was pressing the Chancellor on this within  minutes!Always good to see fellow Liberals backing liberal ideas.It is going to be really important to sustain a discussion on the basic rights and freedoms everyone should be able to access now. People should be free from depending on food banks. People should be able to travel freely to access skills training and broad educational opportunities.The UBI can help stop people falling through the cracks, but other ideas are neededall are to be able to live fulfilling lives of their choosing.This is because the cost of being to be able to exercise basic freedoms ies both across the country and from household to household as people#s inidual circumstances so dfer.The Universal Basic Income would help to kick start the economy and would do do fairly, , as Alistair, suggested, the tax system was used to claw the cash back from those who did not need it. Of course that would involve taxing the rich.Little wonder that the Chancellor dismissed the idea out of hand.Permanent State Fund Dividend of Alaska, the same idea. Not bad for a Trump-voting Republican state. Somewhat predates the liberal idea.

I tried keeping them in all day but I ended up with an ear infection.I tried noise-reduction headphones – very expensive – but anything to keep out that incessant -decibel shrieking.I even tried wearing them whilst gardening and playing an early Queen album at full volume: “Sheer Heart Attack” – that should drown it out,it doesn’t give me one …What next I was so sensitive, or to give it its psychological name – “sensitised” – that I could even pick out the faintest suggestion of a chaffinch on a TV programme.It might be while watching the golf or some Jane Austen adaptation with a scene near some trees – and that blooming chaffinch was there in the background. Why doesn’t anybody  notice it What next  What next to do  Chop all the trees down around the house, down to ground level – that’s what next to do.And so I take an axe and like a deranged lumberjack, I fell every Sitka spruce within earshot.I cut down the white fuchsia to within feet of the ground, and the sessile oak and the sycamores and the rowan and the Swedish whitebeam – the lot, all down to within a few feet of the ground.That should do it. Just tell everyone it’s to give the deciduous trees more space, and the coppicing of what’s left will make them grow all the stronger.And then, next spring – all potential perching sites cleared from near the house….but the traffic!You open the door and there is a car stopped, looking at us and we look out of the window and there is a car stopped looking back at us….What a state to be in!Quick – replant some mature trees to provide an instant screen. The Christmas trees from past years with root balls still intact – they should do it and that escallonia and the New Zealand holly – evergreens to block the view of the road.This is madness. One month I am cutting down all the trees the next month I’m desperate to put them back!There is humour here.Someone calls when the trees have disappeared only to find that when next they visit, just months later, the trees are back again – some fully grown.Complete amazement: “Things don’t half grow fast here!”Thankfully, it’s an episode from the distant past.Time is a great healer I gradually managed to rewire my brain circuits and become habituated to the noise of the chaffinch.I can laugh at it now, but it shows how fragile and vulnerable the human mind can be.And so to the news that’s on everyone’s mind – coronavirus.As someone over , I am trying to minimise the risk of catching it and passing it on. Self-isolating is a daunting prospect and who knows how long this lockdown will last and what the future will bring I am reminded of that classic story from : “The Monkey’s Paw” by WW Jacobs. “Without, the night was cold and wet … ‘Hark at the wind … Path’s a bog and the road’s a torrent.”Gosh!

It followed Stormont Minister Edwin Poots# suggestion that churches, garden centres and forest parks should be allowed to open while maintaining social distancing.Some Church leaders expressed concern about rushing to ease restrictions while others believe it could be done slowly and safely.Rev Steve Stockman from Fitzroy Presbyterian Church in south Belfast said he understands that people have hit a wall after six weeks of lockdown and are becoming frustrated at having to stay at home.While he knows people want to go and worship, Rev Stockman believes the key message now is to love your neighbour by being sensible and staying in to protect the elderly and NHS staff.This is a time when we have to sacrice those rights that we would like in order to keep our neighbours alive by being patient, he said.In our own church we would have to consider holding a couple of Sunday services to ensure social distancing can be met, with people having to leave quickly afterwards with none of the normal socialising being possible Rev Steve StockmanCurrently there is a lot of good worship going on online that means people can be together.While it#s not ideal, many churches seem to be well enough equipped that they don#t need to be rushing back to normal and I have a slight fear about how we would make this a reality.In our own church we would have to consider holding a couple of Sunday services to ensure social distancing can be met, with people having to leave quickly afterwards with none of the normal socialising being possible.However Pastor Mark McClurg, of Newtownards Elim Church, said consideration should be given for the controlled opening of church buildings, particularly in terms of people#s mental wellbeing.Pastor McClurg - who spent several days in the intensive care unit at the Ulster Hospital battling coronavirus and is now recovering at home - said: I feel that we need to have this conversation and I#m not asking for this to happen immediately but for us to think about what markers need to be put in place.I#m hearing from people who are feeling anxious, lonely and fearful for the future and it#s clear that the current situation is affecting their mental health.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePastor Mark McClurg FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPastor Mark McClurgAt the same time we don#t want to open up too early and while it has been great to see that happening in New Zealand, you have to balance it with what happened in Germany where there has been a recurrence of Covid- cases, he added.I am very conscious that some members of my congregation have been in self-isolation since early March and I don#t really see why they can#t come to the church for solitary prayer Fr Michael CannyFr Michael Canny, a Catholic priest in the Waterside area of Londonderry, believes churches could reopen for solitary prayer only rather than full worship.At this point in time I am not advocating that we should have all churches open for all of the many rituals we normally have, such as the Eucharist. The issue is how to we tip-toe out of this situation gently.I am very conscious that some members of my congregation have been in self-isolation since early March and I don#t really see why they can#t come to the church for solitary prayer.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFr Michael Canny FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFr Michael CannyThat view was echoed by Fr Gary Donegan from the Passionist Community in Crossgar.He said social distancing measures could be implemented with the help of volunteers to ensure safe access to churches for prayer and reflection.People could be offered a sacred space where they could sit apart from each other in line with the guidelines, with the seats marked up to indicate safe distances and with the correct hand sanitisation, he said.There are many people out of work at the moment who desperately want to do something and one of the ways around this issue could be seeking volunteers to ensure that only a limited number of people are allowed into churches at any one time.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Now, Finnebrogue hosts a series of social and cultural events throughout the year, boosting funds for charity and keeping the estate at the heart of the community. I asked Noel, chairman of the Hope for Youth charity, how Covid- has impacted le at Finnebrogue.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNoel Lamb in the library at Finnebrogue House FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNoel Lamb in the library at Finnebrogue HouseUnfortunately, the current lockdown has caused several cancellations, he says.We have a iety of events here at Finnebrogue, but one of the most successful is where I offer to host a dinner in the main dining room as an auction lot. One of the guests at the auction, either an inidual or a corporate, makes a bid, with the highest winning the auction lot.On the whole, I#ve no doubt that the situation will have an impact on all historic homes. Those depending on revenue from tours, events and gardens will suffer this year Noel LambThe most disappointing cancellation so far is a charity dinner due in May. Originally, this had been bid for at the Hope for Youth lunch at the Culloden Hotel with Roddy Doyle. It is a black tie event and the saloon, library and dining room would all have been used during the evening. Hopefully we can rearrange it for a later date, depending on social distancing guidelines.Last November, Hope for Youth also bid for a charity dinner at the House of Lords versus House of Commons swim. It was due to take place in November but I think we#ll have to make a decision in July. On the whole, I#ve no doubt that the situation will have an impact on all historic homes. Those depending on revenue from tours, events and gardens will suffer this year. As for Finnebrogue, most of the events are charity-related, so the charities will struggle as donations dry up.Whatever the changes at Finnebrogue, coronavirus has given Noel a new perspective on le.I was in London in mid-March when I suffered a sharp abdominal pain, he tells me. It took four trips to AE before a CT scan revealed a kidney stone. I was admitted to hospital for two days and during that time they tested me for coronavirus. I had none of the listed symptoms, so when it came back positive it was a bit of a shock.For two of those days in hospital I was placed in a Covid- ward where most people were on ventilators and suffering other ailments. I was unlucky to get ill but very fortunate not to have symptoms of the virus. I#ve been feeling fine ever since, but I came out of it with a rather dferent perspective. Now, I just enjoy every day, spending time in spring sunshine, appreciating the beautul gardens.Covid-#s greatest sting is the lack of contact between friends and family.Yes, I am missing the social interaction from friends and family, Noel says. I find not seeing people during the day very strange but fortunately there#s WhatsApp calls and other means of communication. Now, whenever I think of friends far away or those I haven#t seen in a while, I make a point of calling them. So far I have resisted Zoom! But when we get back to normality we#ll appreciate meeting people all the more.What is he looking forward to most when le s to normal I think, at the end of the day, there will have to be re-evaluations. We#ll all get a clearer image of what is really important and have more awareness of others. I#m looking forward to brighter days. Just sitting with friends, around the kitchen table, enjoying a salad or a bowl of pasta - such joy!‘We have so much sympathy for those couples who have had to postpone their wedding plans, but we have found everyone so cooperative’Coronavirus has brought an unprecedented challenge to Richard and Rosalind Mulholland of Ballyscullion Park, an estate which sits on the shores of Lough Beg in Co Londonderry, but it#s not the first the couple have faced.In , Ballyscullion was operating as a dairy farm until TB was detected among the herd and the couple were forced to start again. Making the most of their historic legacy - the Park dates back to  while the house was built in  - they ventured down the hospitality and tourism route, becoming one of Northern Ireland#s top event and wedding destinations.Now, even in light of the pandemic, Rosalind remains upbeat.We#re so fortunate to have the gardens, she says. They keep us busy and give us plenty to do. We took the opportunity of having no weddings to do some repairs on the lawns - levelling and reseeding - but it needs the rain to get it growing again! It#s lovely having three of our children at home and although Cordelia is in lockdown in Italy where she lives with her husband, rugby player Ian McKinley, we keep in touch via the internet.The advantage of a private venue like Ballyscullion Park is that the only people around the estate on the day are those connected to the wedding. We hope that will work in our favour as lockdown eases Rosalind MulhollandOur daughter Oliviais here, also working from home. She is project managing for University College London Hospital Trust, having regular meetings with her team in London. Her husband Kieran is also working from here although at the moment he#s quarantined in one of our cottages because he was in London till last Friday. Our youngest son, Georgegoes shopping once or twice a week to the supermarket or the Hilltown farm shop.

Initially, we didn#t think anything was wrong with him. He even passed his seven month hearing test. We took him everywhere, first to a Harley Street doctor then to Manchester University Hospital for further tests. Later we took him to Holland to a school for the deaf in St Michelgestel. He was five when we discovered he had autism. That was another shock but it also helped us make sense of the way he was. You know, people sometimes say #poor you#. My answer to that is, it#s not poor us - it#s poor James, he#s the one who has to cope. But he has done brilliantly and has thrived at Parkanaur College, near Dungannon, working in the gardening centre, the upholstery workshop and he loves cooking. I think he#s coping well with the lockdown.How did she explain the situation to James I told him the whole world is sick and we have to stay at home. I crossed out all the exciting things on his calendar - weddings, family parties, holidays. He has taken it well and is quite a happy chap.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJames Mulholland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJames MulhollandHow has the lockdown affected business It has been a real challenge, and we have so much sympathy for the couples who have had to re-think their wedding plans, but everyone has been so cooperative, she says. All weddings to the end of June have been postponed, and even some July dates have reserved a back-up slot just in case. The advantage of a private venue like Ballyscullion Park is that the only people around the estate on the day are those connected to the wedding. We hope that will work in our favour as lockdown eases. We are inviting couples who can#t get married on their chosen date to come for a picnic in the garden, once restrictions have eased. They will be able to enjoy the garden without anyone  around, so they can still make some happy memories for their day.What about tour groups All cancelled and I can#t see them starting up till much later in the year, Rosalind remarks. It is really hard for the hospitality industry. Mid Ulster Council has been fantastic and has organized regular Zoom presentations from key people in tourism, legal and financial experts and marketing gurus. Ironically,  was to be the year when so many businesses took off!‘Our BB is closed, weddings and events are cancelled ... we’re looking at ways to ersy’Just a few miles from Bushmills, Ballylough estate has been in the Traill family since . Down through the centuries, the beautul Georgian property has housed many distinguished residents, including Colonel William Traill, pioneer of the first commercially run hydro-electro powered tram system that once operated between Portrush and the Giant#s Causeway. In more recent times, current owners June and David Traill have put the historic property on the hospitality map, including running their house as a bed and breakfast.There is no farming here, so for us to make the property #wash its face# and bring in an income, we#ve had to come up with new business ideas, June explains.In keeping with our charity, Ballylough Living History Trust, we ran the popular event known as Battle of the Boar. I#m also interested in social prescription projects including taking therapies such as counselling outdoors. Now, everything is on hold.We have taken a mortgage holiday thanks to the support of our mortgage supplier, but other loans and costs still have to be paid June TraillOn March , my mother had a hip operation and when she came out of hospital three days later lockdown was just beginning. She needed three carers a day, so it was a no-brainer that I move in with her. I#ve been locked down at mum#s house ever since, while David looks after the house.June#s mum, Christine Wright, a well-known artist, isn#t the only one needing the Traills# help. We have some students from the charity staying at our house, she explains. They couldn#t get home as they live in remote Islands, as far away as Martinique. We all get on well and it#s great that they can keep in touch with their families via Skype and suchlike. We also have two of our sons at home. Henryand his brother Brucehave finished university but with the current situation I don#t know what#ll happen about finding jobs. Our other two boys, Shaneand Paddyare both working from home in England and, like everyone , we use the internet to stay connected.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJune and David Traill at their home in Bushmills FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJune and David Traill at their home in BushmillsCoronavirus has left the economy reeling and, as June points out, for many small businesses the prognosis is poor.Usually, our bed and breakfast funds a lot of the charity work, which we are continuing to support where possible. But now the BB is shut, which means our income is zero. We reinvested every penny into the business, so we had no profits. Weddings have been cancelled, which means refunding deposits that have already been used to upgrade the site. We have taken a mortgage holiday thanks to the support of our mortgage supplier, but other loans and costs still have to be paid.Sadly many, like those in the tourism sector who rely on a very short income period will be badly affected or, indeed, go under.June, however, maintains a glimmer of hope. I#m busy thinking of ways to ersy, she explains. We#ve had time to finish a little free publication about the heritage of the Ballylough area. We#ll be able to hand it out to visitors, guests and the local community. We#re also working on preserving and recreating some of the historical costumes on site, although no idea how we#ll eventually be able to showcase them. Meantime, we#re finishing all those little jobs that have waited for years to be done. The garden, in particular, is getting a lot more attention, so we have been planting plenty of veg and flowers.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is through them that I have been able to help so many others.This has affected hundreds of families but I think things will start to settle down soon because the Universal Credit payments will be coming through, butI have to keep doing what I am doing until the lockdown is lted then so be it.Belfast Most ReadAnger over #ring of steel# at Chinese Consulate in BelfastThai police hold NI man after brutal murder of a prostituteTributes to man who built Northern Ireland#s #smallest church#NI past coronavirus peak but more people flouting lockdown guidelines, warns Chief Scientic OfficerPastor Mark McClurg reveals fears he had infected church goers amid calls for places of worship to reopen ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Committee on Wednesday, West Tyrone MLA Daniel McCrossan said that officials had confirmed that , of Northern Ireland#s , students are not using online resources.However, a DENI spokesperson responded by saying that it does not agree with Mr McCrossan#s interpretation of the figures.Schools have been closed for five weeks since the start of the coronavirus lockdown, with many teachers delivering sessions through online apps and websites such as Google Classroom and Zoom.However, concerns have been raised that many young people are missing out as they do not have access to devices or broadband.DENI has sent principals a questionnaire to find out how successful online learning has been.Mr McCrossan said it was hugely worrying that students in Northern Ireland have not engaged with online classes since schools closed their doors.Not only could this impact on educational outcomes and exams, but it also calls into question whether other means of teaching students have been successfully deployed, he added.The root causes of this problem need to be investigated immediately.I have written to the ministerrequesting that his department review this issue immediately and propose recommendations.This could have a hugely detrimental impact on students should online classes be inaccessible for many.In response, a spokesperson for the department said that its officials had not confirmed the figures that Mr McCrossan had used.Secondly, Mr McCrossan would appear to believe that nursery and pre-school children should be engaging daily in online classes as he has included them in the total number he quotes, the spokesperson continued.Thirdly, the figures presented show daily snapshots of some aspects of online learning activity, but they do not reflect the totality of such activity, nor would anyone expect all learners to be engaging in online lessons every day.The department also said that the figures which were quoted related to one of a range of metrics provided by the Education Authority#s CK system, indicating use of the applications they are able to track.It is therefore not reflective of the entire access to online learning being made by our schools, the spokesperson said.The Education Authority#s CK system has seen a signicant increase in online learning activity since schools have closed.Pupils also have access to multiple other online learning resources outside of those which can be monitored by CK, for example, BBC learning websites.They added: Additionally, a range of other educational software providers have also made their resources available free during this crisis and schools in Northern Ireland can avail of these online tools.Many schools are also making hard copy resources and learning materials available to their pupils.Belfast Most ReadAnger over #ring of steel# at Chinese Consulate in BelfastThai police hold NI man after brutal murder of a prostituteTributes to man who built Northern Ireland#s

What is even more confusing is that the recommendation comes on the back of a report by Cornwall Insight which recognised a rise in fuel prices as well as boiler service and maintenance costs. We want to see the full reinstatement of a fair tarf that reflects their costs. It is a very reasonable request and the least boiler operators deserve at this late stage. UFU vice president Victor Chesnutt Yet DfE have only increased one tarf by .p and the other by .p which could result in many boiler operators moving to oil centred heating especially with the current price of oil.The review was tasked with looking into hardship experienced by participants on the scheme after tarfs were slashed. This came after it was discovered the scheme was creating a perverse incentive for boiler owners to burn fuel. An inquiry into the scheme found corrupt or malicious activity on the part of officials, ministers or special advisers was not the cause of went wrong with the NI RHI scheme.Rather it was an accumulation of errors, omissions over time and a failure of attention, of those involved.Read More RHI Inquiry Report finds no evidence of corruption but criticises behaviour of Stormont ministers and special advisers“UFU boiler operators invested in the RHI scheme in good faith only to be sold out and the UFU’s position remains unchanged, Mr Chesnutt added. We want to see the full reinstatement of a fair tarf that reflects their costs. It is a very reasonable request and the least boiler operators deserve at this late stage.Mr Chesnutt said there is a shortage of biomass on the back of the coronavirus lockdown. He added: There have been moves in Great Britain to extend their RHI scheme meanwhile in Northern Ireland, our Government continue to offer our members mere crumbs from the table.Announcing the move, Economy Minister Diane Dodds said: I have made it clear that, in relation to matters involving the RHI Scheme, I will always seek to act in a manner that is fair to both scheme participants who joined in good faith and to taxpayers who are funding the scheme.A DfE spokesperson said: “The consultation on tarfs is based on independent, expert analysis of the costs faced by RHI participants in Northern Ireland. The Department will consider all evidence put forward by the UFU and other stakeholders during this consultation period which will help inform the Executive’s decision on RHI tarfs.”Belfast Most ReadAnger over #ring of steel# at Chinese Consulate in BelfastThai police hold NI man after brutal murder of a prostituteTributes to man who built Northern Ireland#s #smallest church#NI past coronavirus peak but more people flouting lockdown guidelines, warns Chief Scientic OfficerPastor Mark McClurg reveals fears he had infected church goers amid calls for places of worship to reopen ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its target for the period was  million.The airline group said it is in “active negotiations” with Boeing to cut the number of planned aircraft deliveries over the next  months.It expects to report a net loss of more than  million eurosbetween April and May, with “further losses” in the following three months.The statement went on: “Ryanair entered this unprecedented Covid- crisis with almost  billion eurosin cash, and we continue to actively manage these cash resources to ensure that we can survive this Covid- pandemic, and more importantly theto lower fare flight schedules as soon as possible.“Our customers can look forward to more low air fares as we are forced to compete with flag carrier airlines who have received  billion eurosin state aid ‘doping’ to allow them to sustain below-cost selling for months after this Covid- crisis has passed, as it certainly will over the coming months.”Mr O’Leary said customers may have to wait up to six months for cash refunds for cancelled flights.He told the BBC the group normally processes around , refunds a month, but has a backlog of about  million claims.“The May refunds may take three to six months, he said.“We simply have a gigantic problem. We didn’t cancel these flights out of choice.“These cancellations have been imposed on us by government, almost out of nowhere.“But, we will, I can guarantee you in Ryanair, every customer will receive a cash refundthey want it.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said: “We recognise that this is a very dficult time for employees and their families and, of course, stand ready to support those impacted.“The aviation sector is important to the UK economy and we know that these are challenging times.”Airlines around the world are facing a struggle to survive due to the coronavirus pandemic.On Tuesday it was announced that up to , British Airways workers will lose their jobs, which is more than one in four employees.Sir Richard Branson has warned that Virgin Atlantic will collapse unless it receives Government support.PAMost ReadSinn Fein leader denies using coronavirus pandemic to score political pointsRyanair announces up to , job losses across pilots and cabin crewAnother Irish coronavirus surge ‘dficult to manage’Daniel O#Donnell rumours hurt my mother, says sister MargoTwo men arrested after huge cash haul seized at Dublin Port,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Adele Heaney has been working in the Covid- centre at the Mater Hospital in Belfast after being redeployed from the Royal Victoria Hospital to combat the outbreak. The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ronan McIlvenny has been living in Wellington with his partner Oonagh Morley for almost two years and says the response to the pandemic has been well-received. “They announced a four-stage system when everything started,” said the Limavady native. “Stage  was just trying to control things. Stage  was people starting to work from home and stopping gatherings. Stage  was all non-essential businesses closed and Stage  was lockdown. “We were in full lockdown for four weeks. It was slightly stricter than at home, there were no takeaways or anything like that open, just the supermarkets and hospitals. googletag.cmd.push Initially, the country was toto Stage  on Friday, but the government made the decision to delay the move until after the Anzac Day bank holiday celebrations. From today, cafes will be able to offer takeaway and non-essential businesses such as physio practices can open, but schools will remain shut, with restriction remaining on movement. Ronan believes the country’s response to the pandemic has greatly reduced its effect on the country. He said: “People here are being very strict. You’re still not allowed to meet anybody who’s not in your house, but people are supportive because the number of cases has stayed so low. googletag.cmd.push “All the lockdown restrictions came in here around the same time as at home, but because we were a few weeks behind in terms of cases, it never got out of control. “They completely closed the borders and didn’t let any tourists into the country. If we left the country, we wouldn’t get back in because we’re not New Zealand citizens. “We know two people who got stranded in Ireland, who were home for a holiday. They are probably still paying rent and they have to get someone to send their stuff home.”  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been widely praised for her response to the pandemic but has also achieved respect for how she dealt with the Christchurch shooting last March. “I don’t know how popular she is in terms of day-to-day policies, but she is really well liked as a leader,” said Ronan. “She handled the Christchurch massacre really well last year and she is handling this well. Everyone is happy to believe what she says – it’s the opposite of Boris Johnson in the UK. Experiencing lockdown on the other side of the globe has had a sobering effect on the -year-old secondary school teacher. “It’s the first time I’ve really felt like I don’t live in Ireland anymore,” he said. “We came here planning to live here for a year and although we’ve stayed a bit longer, it still felt like an extended holiday that we could end when we wanted. Now we can’t leave. “A friend’s brother died of a cardiac arrest at the weekend and he couldn’t get home. That’s the worst-case scenario.” Like many of us, Ronan is turning to nostalgia to fill the monotonous days under lockdown and reaching for the glory days that remind him of home. “I watched Derry’s ’ All-Ireland win on YouTube the other day again, so that was a good use of a few hours!”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Long-running plans for a medical school at Ulster University’s Magee campus have been plagued with set-backs. The revised timeline was for enrolment to commence in . The Derry News asked the department whether it expects the medical school to be approved and for medical students to enrol at Magee next year. In response, a Department of Health spokesperson said: “The establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach. googletag.cmd.push “The Department of Health has been clear that there are two separate business case processes in relation to the development of a Graduate Entry Medical School. “The first process, which has been under way since , has involved signicant assistance from departmental officials on the development of Ulster University’s own business case. “Ulster University has been grateful for this assistance, which has ensured that their business case meets the standards within government financial guidance.” He added: “The second process is the development of the Department of Health’s own business case which will outline the need to be addressed by any expansion of medical education. googletag.cmd.push “That business case will be formally submitted to the Minister very shortly. It will be appreciated that the department’s immediate and overriding priority has been the local response to the Coronavirus pandemic. “The Department of Health must ensure that any proposal represents value for money for health and social care. It is for the Executive to collectively decide on the best approach for Northern Ireland as a whole.” There was renewed optimism in January of this year when a deal was agreed by Northern Ireland’s political parties to restore devolved government three years after it collapsed. The New Decade, New Approach document contains firm commitments to a Magee Medical School from both the British and Irish governments. It states: “The Executive will expand university provision at Magee in line with commitments made by the previous Executive, including through the establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School.” Furthermore, under the section outlining the UK government’s financial and economic commitments to Northern Ireland it says: “Capital and resource funding for the Medical School in Derry subject to the Northern Ireland Executive’s approval of the project.” While the Irish government adds that it is ‘willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government.’ COMMITMENTS The commitment referred to above by the previous Executive was for , full-time students at Magee. In   there were , full-time students enrolled at Magee – , overall. Five years previous,  , there were , full-time enrolments – , overall. Shortly after the ‘New Approach’ document was published it emerged that the exact financial package on the table was unknown. When revealed it was described as ‘woefully inadequate’ by Sinn Feacutein finance minister Conor Murphy. At the end of January, the Department for the Economysaid it was committed to delivering expansion of Ulster University’s Belfast campus and would provide UU with a poundm bailout to complete the build. In February, DfE was asked what funding the UK and Irish Governments have committed towards realising , undergraduate places at the Magee campus. DUP economy minister Diane Dodds said: “No funding has, as yet, been formally committed by the UK or Irish Governments towards increasing undergraduate places at the Magee Campus as outlined in New Decade, New Approach. “The Department of Finance remains in discussions with Her Majesty’s Treasuryon the UK Government financial package associated with the priorities in New Decade, New Approach.” For the past month all government departments have understandably been focused on their response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Department of Finance and the Economy were both asked for comment but did not provide any at the time of publishing.

Liam Tunney tells the story of the Kilrea man who swapped the cleaver for the canvas and never looked back. Light plays a key role in County Derry artist Conor Larkin’s work, but for years he carried his own talent with such modesty that it seemed destined to remain in the shadows. The self-taught artist has taken the scenic route to turning his passion into a profession and began his working le in McAtamney’s on Kilrea’s Bridge Street. “I didn’t go to art school or anything, I just left school and got a job in the butchers,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I served my time in McAtamney’s and was there until I was  or . After that I did a bit of travelling, went to Australia and America and got that out of my system. “When I came back, I spent some time on building sites and picking fruit. I’ve only really been painting full time for the past five or six years.”  His artistic talent had not gone unnoticed though and was celebrated in the early days by one of his teachers at Crossroads Primary School. “Mrs Magill was the teacher at the time, and she brought my mum in to look at a picture I had painted. I was maybe P or P,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I remember her telling my mother that the painting was above what I should be doing for my age at that time. “That is my first real memory of somebody picking it up. I even remember what it was – it was a lorry with a sunset behind it. I remember that vividly.” “Even when I was a butcher, I decorated the windows at Christmas and kept painting old milk churns and that to get a few extra pounds. If I could find a smooth surface, I’d paint it. “I would do skateboards and stuff like that when I was at school and I was encouraged by my teachers, but I never took it any further. I was lazy, I suppose. “I ended up getting a job in a glass company and that was the first time I got a job where I was doing something creative.”  Conor’s work at Diamond Glass, in Slaughtneil, involved painting stained glass windows and he began to hone his creative talent, spending more time painting. Even as the shoots of a possible career change were appearing, Conor’s professional radar hadn’t been finely tuned just yet. “Probably the first few I did, I gave them away. It was easy to me, so I just gave them to people,” he said. “The first one I sold was a picture of the Fleadh in Rasharkin. Well, I didn’t actually sell it, I swapped it for an amplier for a guitar. “I had started it, but then realised there were too many people in it and this man approached me and said ‘Look,you finish that, I’ll buy you an amplier for it’. We were playing in a band together. I play a bit of guitar and sing a bit. I still have the amplier, but it probably wasn’t that great a deal when I look at it now!”  Although the talent and ambition were there, there was still the lingering thought that painting was destined only to be a hobby. It took the intervention of a local man to allow Conor to showcase his talent and provided the confidence boost he needed to move things to the next level. He said: “There was a fella in Kilrea called Brendan McAllister, from Edenbane Art. He does a bit of dealing and he askedI’d paint him a few just to see how it went. “I did a few paintings and never really thought much of them, but he came back a week later to say: ‘I’ve sold those, would you do a few more ’ “That made me realise that people were willing to buy them, and it gave me that bit of encouragement.”  If McAllister’s support provided the carrot, the stick came in the form of a conversation with a former butchering colleague, while he was still painting stained glass in Slaughtneil. “It was during that recession when things were getting bad. We were down to a three-day week and the stained glass work was getting less and less. “I got talking to one of the butchers I used to work with. He’s actually a chocolatier now and he said: “If you don’t jump, how are you going to find outyou can do it or not ”  Conor jumped, without looking back. Seven years later there is a -month waiting list for his commissions, requests for which arrive from all over the world. His inspiration though, stems from closer to home. “I live down near the Bann in Kilrea and I’m out on that road a dozen times a day usually,” he said. “There was one day there was a tree and whatever way the sun was shining on it, it got me. I ended up painting it a few times, at dferent times of the year. “Sunsets and autumn light are great. I get fidgety round that time of the evening and I have to get out and get looking at stuff. That’s what I mostly like to paint. “I also love painting old cottages. Sometimes I would drive round the country looking for old, deserted dwellings. I love the way the light plays on the whitewashed walls. “I think everybody has a nostalgic thing for them. Where I grew up, there was an old man who lived across the fields from us and I used to spend time before I went to school over there. “That was the real McCoy, no electricity or anything. There’s a romance about old houses., but there are less of them now. They conjure up memories for many people.”  The Covid- lockdown hasn’t been too taxing for Conor, who doesn’t mind the solitude. It is something to which he has become accustomed. “I’m finding it easy enough because I’m sort of used to it,” he said. “I live out in the sticks anyway so there are days I wouldn’t see a sinner, especially when my we is at work and the weans are at school. “I’m pretty much on my own most of the time anyway, but I do miss being able to jump in the car and head off to the coastI know there is going to be a nice sunset. “I do an online painting demo now every Thursday night from  o’clock. The first painting we did was a few cottages on an old lane and I’m planning to give that away to a key worker. “People are nominating others for it. Somebody on the front line will end up getting that painting. Every wee bit helps.” The Kilrea man carries conversation with the relaxed confidence of a man who has found the holy grail of job satisfaction by turning his hobby into his occupation. “I have done working on building sites, on farms and fruit picking, served my time as a butcher, but while I was doing that, I was always doing the odd wee drawing. “It’s what I’ve always wanted to do. The dream was always to pack in the day job and paint full time, so I suppose I’m living that dream.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Light plays a key role in County Derry artist Conor Larkin’s work, but for years he carried his own talent with such modesty that it seemed destined to remain in the shadows. The self-taught artist has taken the scenic route to turning his passion into a profession and began his working le in McAtamney’s on Kilrea’s Bridge Street. “I didn’t go to art school or anything, I just left school and got a job in the butchers,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I served my time in McAtamney’s and was there until I was  or . After that I did a bit of travelling, went to Australia and America and got that out of my system. “When I came back, I spent some time on building sites and picking fruit. I’ve only really been painting full time for the past five or six years.”  His artistic talent had not gone unnoticed though and was celebrated in the early days by one of his teachers at Crossroads Primary School. “Mrs Magill was the teacher at the time, and she brought my mum in to look at a picture I had painted. I was maybe P or P,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I remember her telling my mother that the painting was above what I should be doing for my age at that time. “That is my first real memory of somebody picking it up. I even remember what it was – it was a lorry with a sunset behind it. I remember that vividly.” “Even when I was a butcher, I decorated the windows at Christmas and kept painting old milk churns and that to get a few extra pounds. If I could find a smooth surface, I’d paint it. “I would do skateboards and stuff like that when I was at school and I was encouraged by my teachers, but I never took it any further. I was lazy, I suppose. “I ended up getting a job in a glass company and that was the first time I got a job where I was doing something creative.”  Conor’s work at Diamond Glass, in Slaughtneil, involved painting stained glass windows and he began to hone his creative talent, spending more time painting. Even as the shoots of a possible career change were appearing, Conor’s professional radar hadn’t been finely tuned just yet. “Probably the first few I did, I gave them away. It was easy to me, so I just gave them to people,” he said. “The first one I sold was a picture of the Fleadh in Rasharkin. Well, I didn’t actually sell it, I swapped it for an amplier for a guitar. “I had started it, but then realised there were too many people in it and this man approached me and said ‘Look,you finish that, I’ll buy you an amplier for it’. We were playing in a band together. I play a bit of guitar and sing a bit. I still have the amplier, but it probably wasn’t that great a deal when I look at it now!”  Although the talent and ambition were there, there was still the lingering thought that painting was destined only to be a hobby. It took the intervention of a local man to allow Conor to showcase his talent and provided the confidence boost he needed to move things to the next level. He said: “There was a fella in Kilrea called Brendan McAllister, from Edenbane Art. He does a bit of dealing and he askedI’d paint him a few just to see how it went. “I did a few paintings and never really thought much of them, but he came back a week later to say: ‘I’ve sold those, would you do a few more ’ “That made me realise that people were willing to buy them, and it gave me that bit of encouragement.”  If McAllister’s support provided the carrot, the stick came in the form of a conversation with a former butchering colleague, while he was still painting stained glass in Slaughtneil. “It was during that recession when things were getting bad. We were down to a three-day week and the stained glass work was getting less and less. “I got talking to one of the butchers I used to work with. He’s actually a chocolatier now and he said: “If you don’t jump, how are you going to find outyou can do it or not ”  Conor jumped, without looking back. Seven years later there is a -month waiting list for his commissions, requests for which arrive from all over the world. His inspiration though, stems from closer to home. “I live down near the Bann in Kilrea and I’m out on that road a dozen times a day usually,” he said. “There was one day there was a tree and whatever way the sun was shining on it, it got me. I ended up painting it a few times, at dferent times of the year. “Sunsets and autumn light are great. I get fidgety round that time of the evening and I have to get out and get looking at stuff. That’s what I mostly like to paint. “I also love painting old cottages. Sometimes I would drive round the country looking for old, deserted dwellings. I love the way the light plays on the whitewashed walls. “I think everybody has a nostalgic thing for them. Where I grew up, there was an old man who lived across the fields from us and I used to spend time before I went to school over there. “That was the real McCoy, no electricity or anything. There’s a romance about old houses., but there are less of them now. They conjure up memories for many people.”  The Covid- lockdown hasn’t been too taxing for Conor, who doesn’t mind the solitude. It is something to which he has become accustomed. “I’m finding it easy enough because I’m sort of used to it,” he said. “I live out in the sticks anyway so there are days I wouldn’t see a sinner, especially when my we is at work and the weans are at school. “I’m pretty much on my own most of the time anyway, but I do miss being able to jump in the car and head off to the coastI know there is going to be a nice sunset. “I do an online painting demo now every Thursday night from  o’clock. The first painting we did was a few cottages on an old lane and I’m planning to give that away to a key worker. “People are nominating others for it. Somebody on the front line will end up getting that painting. Every wee bit helps.” The Kilrea man carries conversation with the relaxed confidence of a man who has found the holy grail of job satisfaction by turning his hobby into his occupation. “I have done working on building sites, on farms and fruit picking, served my time as a butcher, but while I was doing that, I was always doing the odd wee drawing. “It’s what I’ve always wanted to do. The dream was always to pack in the day job and paint full time, so I suppose I’m living that dream.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He was just outside his own half, but distance was no obstacle It was All-Ireland semi-final day, but Derrys  year-old secret weapon played with expression. Termed by some as a pop star footballer, three months younger than Bjoumlrn Borg, McElhinney was inspired by the Swedes headband. It wasnt a spice-boy image without substance. Derrys sorcerer could also walk the walk. He was a boxing champion in his youth and his soccer career, as a centre-half, took him to Northern Irelands -  European qualier win over West Germany. googletag.cmd.push “It was the fastest  minutes, it just went past in a flash. It was just a game...all I wanted to do was play football,” McElhinney said of that night in Hamburg. He held captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge scoreless and on the periphery. McElhinneys shuddering tackle put down a marker early in the game. For all the stages he performed on, he was as modest as he was magical. No airs or graces, just fanatical about playing. Growing up, playing two games every Saturday and Sunday was the grounding that made him. The  All-Ireland semi-final was just an extension and commentator Michael OHehirs exhilarating tones announced Gerry McElhinney to the nation. He took one solo before thundering through a Dublin midfield who were clutching at straws. An explosion of power careered past four Dublin players. Nobody could get a hand on him. He was electrying. He kept the ball under perfect control, while in full flow. As goalkeeper Paddy Cullen came into view, Gerry squeezed a shot through two helpless defenders before it went over the bar. It wasnt enough to prise Sam Maguire away from the Dubs, but unbeknownst to him, it was another reason for the all-stars to select him in his debut season. “I was fit and I just went out and enjoyed myself,” McElhinney said, from his home in Draycott – between Nottingham and Derby - where he has lived with his second we Val for the last  years. “I was training about six nights a week. When I say it was easy...it just came to me. I learned a lot from experienced men around me, about what to do and where to go. I was no longer a baby, I was coming .” He teased opponents as much as he did the Derry fans, who had to be satisfied with four seasons at senior level. As his soccer career tapered to a conclusion, Fr Sean Hegarty recalled him for the  Ulster championship. He was sent on as a sub to try and save a lost cause in the semi-final with a rampant Donegal. With his head stitched up from colliding into a goalpost, he drove away from Clones that day, heading for Dublin to catch a boat. He was Peterborough bound, where he played his last years under manager Mark Lawrenson. “He was a big loss to Derry, he was talented and as tough as they come. He was a great player, even from a young age – a man before his time,” remembers former Derry manager Paddy Crozier, who played with McElhinney on the  Derry minor team beaten by Cavan in the Ulster final. Another Derry all-star, Johnny McGurk, was inspired by him and mesmerised by his dummy, calling it the McElhinney tip – one Owen Mulligan would later tease defences with. Gerry would win his only club championship in the colours of Craigbane. Their  winning goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin, who would have been directing kick-outs to him, made the comparison to Anthony Tohill. “He was the most complete player I remember, he had everything...until big Tohill came along.” Much water would pass under the bridge first. *** The late Mickey and Annie McElhinney raised their family in the townland of Dreen, outside Park, under the shadow of Sawel Mountain. Gerry is the oldest of , with five brothers , Colm, Kieran and five sisters . “We always played football in the field,” he recalls of his childhood. “The girls were the goalkeepers and the boys were playing out the field. We got neighbours over to play and it was always great craic.”  The family home outside Park Gerry would walk half a mile across the fields to attend Moneyhaughan Primary School, a typical country school with limited facilities, an outside toilet and no football pitch. “There was an old field beside it, but you wouldnt have put cows in it, never mind play football on it.” His early footballing days stem back to his time at secondary school in St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy. “Gerry Burns was the PE teacher and there was a guy Hugh Doherty,” McElhinney states. “He was a teacher, but most of the time he spent playing football in the gym.” Doherty pointed him in the direction of Dungiven Celtic, which started his soccer career. Gerry also mentions his former French teacher Seamus Mullan, who was also a local GAA reporter. “Sometimes he wrote good things about me and sometimes he wrote bad things about me,” Gerry laughs. “Seamus wrote about me because I think he wanted me to stay and play for Derry until the day I died. “Hughiewould take us to the hall. Wed play football and basketball there after school. My mother thought I was never coming home, I was never home to about six oclock at night.” There was no electric at home until Gerrys early teens. The first game he remembers watching on television was the replay of the  FA Cup Final. Having received a full blue kit as a present, he began to support Cha and after drawing with Leeds in the final, the replay at Old Trafford went to extra time. David Webb headed in at the far post from Ian Hutchinsons throw-in to win the cup for the blues. It lit a fire in McElhinney. “I thought I want to play at Wembley and I fulfilled my dreams,” he said, having later played at the famous stadium in Northern Irelands - defeat to England. He could have turned his hand to any sport. A natural, but his Gaelic football career would come first. *** Every Saturday morning in his teenage years, Gerry McElhinney would play for Derry City, before turning out for Dungiven Celtic in the afternoon. He played for Banagher on Sunday and hed squeeze in a game for Dungivens Sunday league team in the morning. “Banagher came first, butI could I would playin the morning. In the evening, we would maybe even have went off somewhere to a carnival and play a seven-a-side game,” McElhinney explains. “That was our weekend and during the week we trained. A lot of players did that. Mickey Lynch and Laurence OKane would have played for Derry City after they left the Irish League.” On the GAA front, Banagher knocked on the door of county finals, but never managed to squeeze into the winners enclosure. McElhinney had signed for Bolton by the time their  defeat to Ballinderry came around and an ankle injury in a soccer game the week before the  decider hampered his progress.  The Banagher squad pictured before the  Derry SFC Final.Gerry is fth from the left in the back row. “I ended up playing corner-back,” he remembers of the decision to start him, in the hope he would run it off. “I borrowed big Liam Hinpheys boots. He wore the rugby boots and I thought it would give my ankle some support.” He didnt last the game and Ballinderry edged home. In McElhinneys opinion, their best chance was against Magherafelt in the  final. “I remember both finals, it pissed down with rain. The Magherafelt game was in Swatragh and we definitely shouldve won that one. “We had three county players – Mickey Lynch, Fintan McCloskey and myself.Seamus Hasson had just retired from playing for Derry. SeamusStevenson was a dual player and played for Derry, so basically Banagher had five county players.” By the time his next championship run came around, he had crossed the county border. His first we hailed from Gortin and he played with the club for four seasons, during his time with Bolton. He wasnt the only newcomer. Liam Reilly – who also played in the  final - also moved to Tyrone and joined Gortin. Gortin reached the senior final in  against Augher, who had brothers Eugene and Dessie McKenna in their ranks and were champions three years earlier. It was Gortins first decider and McElhinneys absence was colossal. He had been known for getting the ball at midfield and rampaging all the way forward before hammering to the net. “I was with Bolton at the time and our pre-season had started, so I couldnt get over,” he said of their five-point defeat. It was time to head back to his roots and his brothers who had joined the emerging Craigbane. In  they beat Loup to win the first of seven intermediate titles, the record in the county. In , they were back in the final. This time it was against neighbours Claudy and Gerry McElhinney was in the team. “I was playing soccer and in the summer, at that time, I came home to visit my family and would stay for six or seven weeks. I played during championship time and won a few Dr Kerlin Cups,” he remembers. Craigbane were seven points down with seven minutes remaining and missed a first half penalty. The title was slipping away, but Conrad McGuigan found the net before player coach Paul Dixon hit a second goal to salvage a draw, - to -. “Tommy White and Charlie Kerrigan were playing, Claudy had a good side,” McElhinney explains.  Craigbanes winning team of . Gerry has his head bowed on the back row Dixon trained them like dogs for the two weeks before the replay. Six or seven sessions were combined with a challenge game with Donemana to sharpen their attacking game. The replay was a dferent story, with Craigbane in control, winning - to -. Gerry scored a point in the game. He later pulled his hamstring, but played on and later went to full-forward, as he picked up his only club championship medal. *** When Derry came knocking in the early s, McElhinney was in his prime. On top of an already bulging schedule, he boxed off and on for two years with Draperstown, under Jim Noonan. He holds a Mid Ulster title and was balancing the spinning plates. He had a spell in Glasgow Celtics reserves while playing at home with Derry minor footballers. Celtic was fitted in around his work, on a semi-professional deal. He failed to break into the first team, but would come for the weekend to play for the reserves. While Noonan urged him to keep his weight down, Jock Stein wanted him to bulk up. “My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney recalls of his time in Glasgow. “I was only  stone  and boxing welterweight, by the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry, I was  stone ...I went from welterweight to middleweight.” In , his first year out of minor, Frankie Kearney called him up to a Derry senior team gearing up for one of of the most successful eras in the countys history. “My Dad lted me at the airport on my way back from Celtic and took me straight to Magherafelt for a McKenna Cup game with Antrim and Gerry Armstrong was playing for them.” The season snowballed into a march to Croke Park. In Ulster, Derry needed a replay to see off Monaghan in the semi-final. They were staring defeat in the face when Eugene Laverty won a penalty that Peter Stevenson scored to give the Oakleafers a second chance. Five McElhinney points and his influence at midfield tamed the Farney men in the replay. In the final with Down, Gerrys early goal set Derry on their way to the first of their back to back titles. Man of the match was his Banagher teammate Mickey Lynch with - to his name. The Dubs ended their All-Ireland dreams, but the following year they retained the Ulster title and were humbled in the All-Ireland semi-final by the Kerry team at the beginning of their golden years. Mickey ODwyer rated Derry as the best team never to have won an All-Ireland. Did McElhinney think they were serious contenders  “We knew we were close when we ran Dublin to a point in the  league final. If we had won that  national league, we wouldve given the All-Ireland a run for it,” he remembers. “It is hard to pick it up after being beat by a point, especially in Croke Park on their home patch. “We had some great players on that team. Anthony McGurk was an all-star by that time. Sean OConnell and Seamus Lagan, sadly not with us anymore, they were all big guns then. “Tom McGuinness, Johnny OLeary and Mickey Lynch...Mickey was my team mate and we travelled everywhere together.” Eight points from Brendan Kelly and a man of the match performance from Anthony McGurk helped Derry to an extra time win over Cavan in the  Ulster final. Derry led by four points after  minutes of the All-Ireland semi-final final, with McElhinney in fine fettle at midfield, against Jack OShea. The Ulster champions led Kerry until early in the second half when super sub Seanie Walsh found the net. The wheels fell off the wagon as the Munster men rattled - in the second half. *** Wins over Tyrone and Donegal took Derry back to an Ulster final in . On the cusp of a third Ulster title and with the Connacht champions to come in the All-Ireland semi-final, they would avoid the Dubs and Kerry until the final. Armagh had other ideas. “Paddy Moriarty destroyed us and we just ran out of steam...that was a bad result.” said McElhinney of their - to - drubbing. He wouldfor the  season. Barring his late cameo in , he bowed away from the county scene. All too early, but his soccer career came calling. Also at that time, Mickey John Forbes ran charity football weekends and players from all over Ulster would play. “They came up from Kerry. It was a couple of times a year and you were getting as many at it, as youd get any many club finals. “There was a hooley after with singers like Susan McCann, Eileen Keane and Philomena Begley. All the top names turned out, it was almost like two all-star selects.” McElhinneys passport was well-stamped and he has been to USA over a dozen times during his career. “If Derry were ever knocked out of anything, I used to just go to America to play Gaelic. I played in New York for Sligo. A Banagher man, Martin Murphy, was manager there and he put me up. “They would fly me over for the weekend to play in Gaelic Park. I always remember the trains going past every ten minutes, alongside the pitch almost. “I played with Cavan in Philadelphia after Armagh beat us. Tom Farrelly was heavily involved in the GAA out there and I worked for him as a landscape gardener. “Tyrone were a big team out there most years with Frankie McGuigan and boys like Brendan Donnelly and Dominic Daly. We played against each other, but all met up and were the best of friends.” The summer of  was his last footballing foray across the Atlantic. “We won the championship in Chicago for Connemara Gaels. I worked out there and played out there. “There wasnt much training involved. They got you work on building sites and there were plenty of contractors out there, Irish guys who were trying to make a buck. “I remember having a car, it only cost me . I parked it up in the car park at OHare Airport and home I went.” Is the wagon still here, I ponder  “It might be,” McElhinney says with a laugh. With the s around the corner, it was soccer time. In part two, McElhinney rolls the clock back on Billy Bingham handing him his debut against the Germans and the trials and tribulations of transferring to the English leagues.

McElhinney had signed for Bolton by the time their  defeat to Ballinderry came around and an ankle injury in a soccer game the week before the  decider hampered his progress.  The Banagher squad pictured before the  Derry SFC Final.Gerry is fth from the left in the back row. “I ended up playing corner-back,” he remembers of the decision to start him, in the hope he would run it off. “I borrowed big Liam Hinpheys boots. He wore the rugby boots and I thought it would give my ankle some support.” He didnt last the game and Ballinderry edged home. In McElhinneys opinion, their best chance was against Magherafelt in the  final. “I remember both finals, it pissed down with rain. The Magherafelt game was in Swatragh and we definitely shouldve won that one. “We had three county players – Mickey Lynch, Fintan McCloskey and myself.Seamus Hasson had just retired from playing for Derry. SeamusStevenson was a dual player and played for Derry, so basically Banagher had five county players.” By the time his next championship run came around, he had crossed the county border. His first we hailed from Gortin and he played with the club for four seasons, during his time with Bolton. He wasnt the only newcomer. Liam Reilly – who also played in the  final - also moved to Tyrone and joined Gortin. Gortin reached the senior final in  against Augher, who had brothers Eugene and Dessie McKenna in their ranks and were champions three years earlier. It was Gortins first decider and McElhinneys absence was colossal. He had been known for getting the ball at midfield and rampaging all the way forward before hammering to the net. “I was with Bolton at the time and our pre-season had started, so I couldnt get over,” he said of their five-point defeat. It was time to head back to his roots and his brothers who had joined the emerging Craigbane. In  they beat Loup to win the first of seven intermediate titles, the record in the county. In , they were back in the final. This time it was against neighbours Claudy and Gerry McElhinney was in the team. “I was playing soccer and in the summer, at that time, I came home to visit my family and would stay for six or seven weeks. I played during championship time and won a few Dr Kerlin Cups,” he remembers. Craigbane were seven points down with seven minutes remaining and missed a first half penalty. The title was slipping away, but Conrad McGuigan found the net before player coach Paul Dixon hit a second goal to salvage a draw, - to -. “Tommy White and Charlie Kerrigan were playing, Claudy had a good side,” McElhinney explains.  Craigbanes winning team of . Gerry has his head bowed on the back row Dixon trained them like dogs for the two weeks before the replay. Six or seven sessions were combined with a challenge game with Donemana to sharpen their attacking game. The replay was a dferent story, with Craigbane in control, winning - to -. Gerry scored a point in the game. He later pulled his hamstring, but played on and later went to full-forward, as he picked up his only club championship medal. *** When Derry came knocking in the early s, McElhinney was in his prime. On top of an already bulging schedule, he boxed off and on for two years with Draperstown, under Jim Noonan. He holds a Mid Ulster title and was balancing the spinning plates. He had a spell in Glasgow Celtics reserves while playing at home with Derry minor footballers. Celtic was fitted in around his work, on a semi-professional deal. He failed to break into the first team, but would come for the weekend to play for the reserves. While Noonan urged him to keep his weight down, Jock Stein wanted him to bulk up. “My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney recalls of his time in Glasgow. “I was only  stone  and boxing welterweight, by the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry, I was  stone ...I went from welterweight to middleweight.” In , his first year out of minor, Frankie Kearney called him up to a Derry senior team gearing up for one of of the most successful eras in the countys history. “My Dad lted me at the airport on my way back from Celtic and took me straight to Magherafelt for a McKenna Cup game with Antrim and Gerry Armstrong was playing for them.” The season snowballed into a march to Croke Park. In Ulster, Derry needed a replay to see off Monaghan in the semi-final. They were staring defeat in the face when Eugene Laverty won a penalty that Peter Stevenson scored to give the Oakleafers a second chance. Five McElhinney points and his influence at midfield tamed the Farney men in the replay. In the final with Down, Gerrys early goal set Derry on their way to the first of their back to back titles. Man of the match was his Banagher teammate Mickey Lynch with - to his name. The Dubs ended their All-Ireland dreams, but the following year they retained the Ulster title and were humbled in the All-Ireland semi-final by the Kerry team at the beginning of their golden years. Mickey ODwyer rated Derry as the best team never to have won an All-Ireland. Did McElhinney think they were serious contenders  “We knew we were close when we ran Dublin to a point in the  league final. If we had won that  national league, we wouldve given the All-Ireland a run for it,” he remembers. “It is hard to pick it up after being beat by a point, especially in Croke Park on their home patch. “We had some great players on that team. Anthony McGurk was an all-star by that time. Sean OConnell and Seamus Lagan, sadly not with us anymore, they were all big guns then. “Tom McGuinness, Johnny OLeary and Mickey Lynch...Mickey was my team mate and we travelled everywhere together.” Eight points from Brendan Kelly and a man of the match performance from Anthony McGurk helped Derry to an extra time win over Cavan in the  Ulster final. Derry led by four points after  minutes of the All-Ireland semi-final final, with McElhinney in fine fettle at midfield, against Jack OShea. The Ulster champions led Kerry until early in the second half when super sub Seanie Walsh found the net. The wheels fell off the wagon as the Munster men rattled - in the second half. *** Wins over Tyrone and Donegal took Derry back to an Ulster final in . On the cusp of a third Ulster title and with the Connacht champions to come in the All-Ireland semi-final, they would avoid the Dubs and Kerry until the final. Armagh had other ideas. “Paddy Moriarty destroyed us and we just ran out of steam...that was a bad result.” said McElhinney of their - to - drubbing. He wouldfor the  season. Barring his late cameo in , he bowed away from the county scene. All too early, but his soccer career came calling. Also at that time, Mickey John Forbes ran charity football weekends and players from all over Ulster would play. “They came up from Kerry. It was a couple of times a year and you were getting as many at it, as youd get any many club finals. “There was a hooley after with singers like Susan McCann, Eileen Keane and Philomena Begley. All the top names turned out, it was almost like two all-star selects.” McElhinneys passport was well-stamped and he has been to USA over a dozen times during his career. “If Derry were ever knocked out of anything, I used to just go to America to play Gaelic. I played in New York for Sligo. A Banagher man, Martin Murphy, was manager there and he put me up. “They would fly me over for the weekend to play in Gaelic Park. I always remember the trains going past every ten minutes, alongside the pitch almost. “I played with Cavan in Philadelphia after Armagh beat us. Tom Farrelly was heavily involved in the GAA out there and I worked for him as a landscape gardener. “Tyrone were a big team out there most years with Frankie McGuigan and boys like Brendan Donnelly and Dominic Daly. We played against each other, but all met up and were the best of friends.” The summer of  was his last footballing foray across the Atlantic. “We won the championship in Chicago for Connemara Gaels. I worked out there and played out there. “There wasnt much training involved. They got you work on building sites and there were plenty of contractors out there, Irish guys who were trying to make a buck. “I remember having a car, it only cost me . I parked it up in the car park at OHare Airport and home I went.” Is the wagon still here, I ponder  “It might be,” McElhinney says with a laugh. With the s around the corner, it was soccer time. In part two, McElhinney rolls the clock back on Billy Bingham handing him his debut against the Germans and the trials and tribulations of transferring to the English leagues.

He felt any chance of landing Sam disappeared when his team of the s failed to deliver in Croke Park. Derry won three Ulster senior titles in the decade and lost the  to All-Ireland finalists Armagh.

The smiling photograph of the little girl in a First Communion dress was taken by former Derry Journal photographerLarry Doherty in the s. It lay uncollected in a box for many years until Larrys daughter, Moira Doherty, discovered it recently and posted it on Facebook in the hope of reuniting it with its owner.

As time went on more and more people contacted her who suggested it was her mum, Maura Wade nee Doherty, who passed away almost seven years ago. At first Mrs Morroiwas unsureit wasdefinitely her, and she didnt want to collect the picture in case it belonged to another family. However, she was inundated with calls and messages from people who remembered her mother as a young girl and confirmed it was indeed her in the picture. Maura Dohertywas born in  the front room of her grandparentshome in  Bishops Street, which is now the Oakgrove Bar. googletag.cmd.push Her parents Maureen and George Doherty then moved to  Long Tower STreet where she grew up and attended the Wee Nuns school. My mammy worked in all the factories so everybody knew her, explained Mrs Morroi. She was a really bubbly person and would have chatted to anyone.

Its so special to get it because I only have two other pictures of my mother as a child.  Mrs Morroisaid the whole experience has been very emotional.

The -strong group managed to raise pound, after abseiling down the Tower Museum building in Derry in the inaugural charity event at the beginning of March. Money raised from the event will go towards the pound million per year cost associated with running the le-saving Helicopter Emergency Medical Service . HEMS paramedic Jason Rosborough was among those who took part in the event and said the funds were vital to the running of the service. “As a service we rely heavily on charitable donations to keep us in the air, delivering critical care to patients who have suffered trauma throughout Northern Ireland,” said the Eglinton native. googletag.cmd.push “With the sponsorship raised for taking on this exciting challenge, we have all done our bit to raise much needed funds for Air Ambulance NI.” Earlier this year Jason told the County Derry Post why the HEMS service was so important. He said: “The helicopter means we can deliver critical care interventions to patients that they wouldn’t get unless they were in a hospital department. “We bring the hospital department to the patient and deliver those interventions that have the potential to save le.” The service operates for  hours per day,  days a week and aims to reach anywhere in Northern Ireland within  minutes. googletag.cmd.push Regular donations allow AANI to better predict income levels to keep the helicopter flying and public support for the service is vital. Deputy Chair of AANI, Ian Crowe, has encouraged people to support their membership scheme. He said: “We are so grateful to everyone who took part in the Tower Museum Abseil, I put my fear of heights aside to join in. “The event was a brilliant success for the charity and something we will run again when the time is right. As a charity we rely on the support of local people to keep our helicopter flying. “With the current absence of fundraising events such as this one, I urge anyone who can to donate online or sign up to become a Club AANI member.” Anyone interested in becoming a member can contact AANI via email at info@airambulance.org or visit the website for more information.

The -strong group managed to raise pound, after abseiling down the Tower Museum building in Derry in the inaugural charity event at the beginning of March. Money raised from the event will go towards the pound million per year cost associated with running the le-saving Helicopter Emergency Medical Service . HEMS paramedic Jason Rosborough was among those who took part in the event and said the funds were vital to the running of the service. “As a service we rely heavily on charitable donations to keep us in the air, delivering critical care to patients who have suffered trauma throughout Northern Ireland,” said the Eglinton native. googletag.cmd.push “With the sponsorship raised for taking on this exciting challenge, we have all done our bit to raise much needed funds for Air Ambulance NI.” Earlier this year Jason told the County Derry Post why the HEMS service was so important. He said: “The helicopter means we can deliver critical care interventions to patients that they wouldn’t get unless they were in a hospital department. “We bring the hospital department to the patient and deliver those interventions that have the potential to save le.” The service operates for  hours per day,  days a week and aims to reach anywhere in Northern Ireland within  minutes. googletag.cmd.push Regular donations allow AANI to better predict income levels to keep the helicopter flying and public support for the service is vital. Deputy Chair of AANI, Ian Crowe, has encouraged people to support their membership scheme. He said: “We are so grateful to everyone who took part in the Tower Museum Abseil, I put my fear of heights aside to join in. “The event was a brilliant success for the charity and something we will run again when the time is right. As a charity we rely on the support of local people to keep our helicopter flying. “With the current absence of fundraising events such as this one, I urge anyone who can to donate online or sign up to become a Club AANI member.” Anyone interested in becoming a member can contact AANI via email at info@airambulance.org or visit the website for more information.

He sat down with Michael McMullan to talk about how he almost missed out on Derry’s greatest hour. When Brian McGilligan shakes your hand, it stays shook. Locked, like a wench. It reminds you of the toughness of a man who turned the midfield battlegrounds of Ireland upside down. A man who Ireland manager Kevin Heffernan took one glance at and knew he would not need baby-sitting when faced with any form thuggery the Australians could heave at him. The man that, alongside Anthony Tohill, formed the perfect midfield partnership. A duo that dozed all before it. googletag.cmd.push He is one of six players to start and finish all five games on the way to the historic summit of . It is put to him that he played a central part in something that has never been equalled. “Do you think so sur ” came the instant reply. With  minutes of the All-Ireland Final gone Niall Cahalane’s mis-directed fist pass is too high and squirms through the fingers of Teddy McCarthy. McGilligan laps up the gt before slotting over his third score of the campaign. Four minutes previous, with Cork - to - ahead, he was involved in the move that led to Johnny McGurk’s point - Derry’s first of a jittery start. googletag.cmd.push The midfield warrior’s input didn’t end there. Wing-forward Barry Coffey had a height advantage over Johnny McGurk. The pre-game chat suggested that goalkeeper John Kerins was expected to exploit it. Kerins’ th minute kick-out was angled towards Coffey, who was hugging the Cusack Stand sideline. McGilligan scampered across - effortlessly almost - before thundering through Coffey for the breaking ball. His physique didn’t suggest he was fast. He was deceptive. “Over  metres nobody could touch me,” McGilligan states. “Tony Scullion would be close, Joe Brolly over the first  or  yards would have been fast but I would have stuffed them after that. “Every evening after school you were running and feeding sheep. I was naturally fit and was carrying no weight.” In Coffey’s wake and with the leather in his grasp, McGilligan thumped the ball goalwards. It was the days when you had to fight your own corner. He had done his bit. Now the forwards needed to man up. Enda Gormley nipped ahead of Cahalane to flick the wet ball into the path of Damian Cassidy. Cassidy’s left-footed kick evaded Cahalane’s intended block and hung in the air above full-back Mark O’Connor before Seamus Downey punched to the net and Derry were two points ahead. The measure of a leader is how they respond to adversity. As Derry’s landmark Sunday flirted with failure, before it had left the starting blocks, McGilligan was involved in three of the game’s key moments. The craved All-Ireland title would follow, but it so nearly passed him by. *** It’s a Wednesday night in the McGilligan household. Like a scene from game day in any corner of Ireland. Brian Oacuteg and Fiontan are gathering their gear for a game. Cathair points me in the direction of the farmyard. After a day on the site, Brian senior is out feeding the stock. In full view below, through the open side of the shed, is the Benedy. We head up to the house. Traversing back through the living room is like walking through a museum. The walls are scarcely visible, around framed pictures of Dungiven, Derry and Ulster teams. Charting the career of one of the Derry’s most famous sons. But hurling was his first love. He was reared in the cottages at Owenbeg and went to Dernaflaw school which, despite its small size, also produced Joe Brolly to Derry’s winning team. “The Damperwas there and we had a pretty good hurling team and won a couple of Feacuteiles,” McGilligan recalled. It was pre-Kevin Lynch’s and Dernaflaw would always be beating Dungiven at underage. McGilligan’s football career began as a goalkeeper at U and U. The genuine interest wasn’t there but with flailing numbers, he played almost out of necessity. Now at ‘the big school’ in Dungiven, the oldest of a family of six was now needed on the farm. Spare time was a limited commodity. “You had to go and look sheep and feed them. That was every evening. My fatherwas working and it was up to me. My motherwould lt me at the school gates.” An U title in  was followed two years later by U glory but it wasn’t until the minor grade, under George Murphy, that he made the breakthrough. A championship game with Magherafelt came around the corner and his dual with Joe Beattie, who had a huge reputation at the time, changed the direction of McGilligan’s career. “They threw me out at centre-half back to mark him,” he outlined. Dungiven went on to win two minor championships, but he never was able to break into the mould at county level. In his final year, , he watched on as an unused substitute as Cork beat Derry in the All-Ireland Minor Final. “They put on every Tom, Dick and Harry. It was all about who you were, who your father was and what pedigree you had. They weren’t going to put a rahery like me on,” McGilligan said. As he admits himself, there is a stubbornness. He stuck at it and took his chances when they came. One Sunday, Dungiven reserve manager Liam Harrycoaxed McGilligan from a corn field to make up the numbers for a trip to Ballinderry. Never an easy place to go to. “It was like something from a ‘Carry on’ film,” McGilligan described. “A boy was going to hit a penalty and somebody would run up behind him and trip him. It was the Wild West - there is no other way to say it.” The experience of the reserve and senior games on a Sunday was a lesson for a decorated career that would follow. Andy Murphy came in as manager in . He saw something in McGilligan and pushed him towards the team. His instincts paid off. A year later at Ballinascreen, a star-studded Magherafelt side led Dungiven - to -, as the county final ticked into the final moments. Liam McElhinney’s kick hung in the air. It was the last hurrah. Out of nowhere, McGilligan got a fist to the ball – punching to the net. It lives long in Dungiven folklore and that winning goal helped him to the first of five county medals. His career began to take root. *** It was Sunday, June   at Omagh’s Healey. Derry were trailing Tyrone by ‘five or six points’ and Jim McKeever called Brian McGilligan from the dug-out. There was no warm up required. “I was mad keen to get on. I thought I should have started,” McGilligan recalls of his debut. “I went on and I won a couple of balls and we turned it, but Noel McGinn hit a wonder strike.” The goal ended Derry’s hopes but Tyrone would later have a major part to play in McGilligan’s summer. The Kevin Barry’s club in Philadelphia came calling and he headed across the pond. As time went by, he felt he may never . “I wasn’t for coming back. I had work and plenty of money...everything…and the weather was favourable. I was playing football and hurling – it was a home away from home.” With no mobile phones, communication wasn’t as it is now. The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story. It’s not going to be back again,” he recalled thinking. In the lead-up to the game, he had asked his fatherhe was going to the game. He wasn’t. It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope. McGilligan, Tony Scullion and Kieran McKeever – with their partners – were among those unable to get a seat in the mainroom. “It was like something out of a Monty Python sketch - it was hilarious. There were no seats for us. It wasn’t big enough to hold thefor starters. I actually saw somebody move name pieces and sit on the Bishop’s seat.” Seated in dferent room, upstairs, they began to tuck into their soup, one of the RTE staff came upstairs. The Sunday Game was about to go on air but McGilligan was reluctant to go downstairs. He was ‘embarrassed’ as others were forced to give up their seat in the middle of the . Even back at the Airport Hotel, later that night, where Derry were staying, there was only a ‘wee hatch’ open to serve up to  people, including Henry Downey and a certain Sam Maguire. With the cup needing filled, McGilligan issued a ‘bit of advice’ to the night porter and eventually two shutters opened on the bar. It was Monday before the occasion began to seep fully into the mind. Now it was real. *** The Moy was packed and when Derry bus-driver Benny Vincent opened the door - in came Plunkett Donaghy. The previous season, he spilled Anthony Tohill’s ‘’ into the net in the league final to start the ball rolling on Derry’s odyssey. This was dferent. This was a tribute to the sons of Ulster bringing home the Sam. “You had the Garda escort coming out of Dublin and you were stopping in every town,” McGilligan recalls. “There were thousands of people waiting on us on a lorry in every town on the way up.” In Cookstown there was a Loyalist road block. Plan B was to ert via Coalisland. But McGilligan instructed Vincent to head on up the town – as far as they could go. There were thousands of Tyrone people wanting a glance at Sam. “It was unheard of for a team from the North. Down had done it before and it wasn’t new to them - it was new to Derry.” The homecoming seemed to go on forever. In every town, before they were greeted by the huge crowd in Maghera, outside Glen club, before the cup was taken to the four corners of the county. When it was McGilligan’s turn to have the cup, he paraded it around the homes of the Benedy. Back to the days when Liam Harry came rounding him up to make up the numbers. His career had now come full circle. He hosted a night in his house. It was packed, with cars strewn alongside the road. “There was a death up in the Benedy,” added McGilligan, remembering the night vividly. A stranger to the area saw the commotion and stopped off. “He said to somebody ‘where’s the remains at’ – he saw all the cars and thought it was the wake house. He laughed and away he went.” *** The glory days ended abruptly. With Ciaran McCabe’s winning goal for Down in , Derry’s world came crashing down. There was no back door and Derry’s All-Ireland dreams were in tatters. McGilligan laments the  years since meeting Sam. “Any other county would have got their act together. Too many boys partied, lived the high le and thought it was only matter of turning up. “We definitely should have won another one. The players were good enough, you can’t pinpoint any one thing. It was the perfect storm. There was a whole lot of things going on behind. You see where things have gone,” he continued. “We are still as far away from winning another one. We are starting from the bottom again – we are in ision four.” That aside, McGilligan is content on how his GAA career panned out. “It kept me on the straight and narrow. Everybody has their vices and the GAA was a vice for me. If it wasn’t football it was hurling.” Nulling the impact of Joe Beattie, punching home a county final winning goal and answering Kevin Heffernan’s call tofrom America. The important markers in the career of one of Derry’s famous sons. RELATED - Gerry McElhinney - the greatest showman. Click here...

He sat down with Michael McMullan to talk about how he almost missed out on Derry’s greatest hour. When Brian McGilligan shakes your hand, it stays shook. Locked, like a wench. It reminds you of the toughness of a man who turned the midfield battlegrounds of Ireland upside down. A man who Ireland manager Kevin Heffernan took one glance at and knew he would not need baby-sitting when faced with any form thuggery the Australians could heave at him. The man that, alongside Anthony Tohill, formed the perfect midfield partnership. A duo that dozed all before it. googletag.cmd.push He is one of six players to start and finish all five games on the way to the historic summit of . It is put to him that he played a central part in something that has never been equalled. “Do you think so sur ” came the instant reply. With  minutes of the All-Ireland Final gone Niall Cahalane’s mis-directed fist pass is too high and squirms through the fingers of Teddy McCarthy. McGilligan laps up the gt before slotting over his third score of the campaign. Four minutes previous, with Cork - to - ahead, he was involved in the move that led to Johnny McGurk’s point - Derry’s first of a jittery start. googletag.cmd.push The midfield warrior’s input didn’t end there. Wing-forward Barry Coffey had a height advantage over Johnny McGurk. The pre-game chat suggested that goalkeeper John Kerins was expected to exploit it. Kerins’ th minute kick-out was angled towards Coffey, who was hugging the Cusack Stand sideline. McGilligan scampered across - effortlessly almost - before thundering through Coffey for the breaking ball. His physique didn’t suggest he was fast. He was deceptive. “Over  metres nobody could touch me,” McGilligan states. “Tony Scullion would be close, Joe Brolly over the first  or  yards would have been fast but I would have stuffed them after that. “Every evening after school you were running and feeding sheep. I was naturally fit and was carrying no weight.” In Coffey’s wake and with the leather in his grasp, McGilligan thumped the ball goalwards. It was the days when you had to fight your own corner. He had done his bit. Now the forwards needed to man up. Enda Gormley nipped ahead of Cahalane to flick the wet ball into the path of Damian Cassidy. Cassidy’s left-footed kick evaded Cahalane’s intended block and hung in the air above full-back Mark O’Connor before Seamus Downey punched to the net and Derry were two points ahead. The measure of a leader is how they respond to adversity. As Derry’s landmark Sunday flirted with failure, before it had left the starting blocks, McGilligan was involved in three of the game’s key moments. The craved All-Ireland title would follow, but it so nearly passed him by. *** It’s a Wednesday night in the McGilligan household. Like a scene from game day in any corner of Ireland. Brian Oacuteg and Fiontan are gathering their gear for a game. Cathair points me in the direction of the farmyard. After a day on the site, Brian senior is out feeding the stock. In full view below, through the open side of the shed, is the Benedy. We head up to the house. Traversing back through the living room is like walking through a museum. The walls are scarcely visible, around framed pictures of Dungiven, Derry and Ulster teams. Charting the career of one of the Derry’s most famous sons. But hurling was his first love. He was reared in the cottages at Owenbeg and went to Dernaflaw school which, despite its small size, also produced Joe Brolly to Derry’s winning team. “The Damperwas there and we had a pretty good hurling team and won a couple of Feacuteiles,” McGilligan recalled. It was pre-Kevin Lynch’s and Dernaflaw would always be beating Dungiven at underage. McGilligan’s football career began as a goalkeeper at U and U. The genuine interest wasn’t there but with flailing numbers, he played almost out of necessity. Now at ‘the big school’ in Dungiven, the oldest of a family of six was now needed on the farm. Spare time was a limited commodity. “You had to go and look sheep and feed them. That was every evening. My fatherwas working and it was up to me. My motherwould lt me at the school gates.” An U title in  was followed two years later by U glory but it wasn’t until the minor grade, under George Murphy, that he made the breakthrough. A championship game with Magherafelt came around the corner and his dual with Joe Beattie, who had a huge reputation at the time, changed the direction of McGilligan’s career. “They threw me out at centre-half back to mark him,” he outlined. Dungiven went on to win two minor championships, but he never was able to break into the mould at county level. In his final year, , he watched on as an unused substitute as Cork beat Derry in the All-Ireland Minor Final. “They put on every Tom, Dick and Harry. It was all about who you were, who your father was and what pedigree you had. They weren’t going to put a rahery like me on,” McGilligan said. As he admits himself, there is a stubbornness. He stuck at it and took his chances when they came. One Sunday, Dungiven reserve manager Liam Harrycoaxed McGilligan from a corn field to make up the numbers for a trip to Ballinderry. Never an easy place to go to. “It was like something from a ‘Carry on’ film,” McGilligan described. “A boy was going to hit a penalty and somebody would run up behind him and trip him. It was the Wild West - there is no other way to say it.” The experience of the reserve and senior games on a Sunday was a lesson for a decorated career that would follow. Andy Murphy came in as manager in . He saw something in McGilligan and pushed him towards the team. His instincts paid off. A year later at Ballinascreen, a star-studded Magherafelt side led Dungiven - to -, as the county final ticked into the final moments. Liam McElhinney’s kick hung in the air. It was the last hurrah. Out of nowhere, McGilligan got a fist to the ball – punching to the net. It lives long in Dungiven folklore and that winning goal helped him to the first of five county medals. His career began to take root. *** It was Sunday, June   at Omagh’s Healey. Derry were trailing Tyrone by ‘five or six points’ and Jim McKeever called Brian McGilligan from the dug-out. There was no warm up required. “I was mad keen to get on. I thought I should have started,” McGilligan recalls of his debut. “I went on and I won a couple of balls and we turned it, but Noel McGinn hit a wonder strike.” The goal ended Derry’s hopes but Tyrone would later have a major part to play in McGilligan’s summer. The Kevin Barry’s club in Philadelphia came calling and he headed across the pond. As time went by, he felt he may never . “I wasn’t for coming back. I had work and plenty of money...everything…and the weather was favourable. I was playing football and hurling – it was a home away from home.” With no mobile phones, communication wasn’t as it is now. The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story. It’s not going to be back again,” he recalled thinking. In the lead-up to the game, he had asked his fatherhe was going to the game. He wasn’t. It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope. McGilligan, Tony Scullion and Kieran McKeever – with their partners – were among those unable to get a seat in the mainroom. “It was like something out of a Monty Python sketch - it was hilarious. There were no seats for us. It wasn’t big enough to hold thefor starters. I actually saw somebody move name pieces and sit on the Bishop’s seat.” Seated in dferent room, upstairs, they began to tuck into their soup, one of the RTE staff came upstairs. The Sunday Game was about to go on air but McGilligan was reluctant to go downstairs. He was ‘embarrassed’ as others were forced to give up their seat in the middle of the . Even back at the Airport Hotel, later that night, where Derry were staying, there was only a ‘wee hatch’ open to serve up to  people, including Henry Downey and a certain Sam Maguire. With the cup needing filled, McGilligan issued a ‘bit of advice’ to the night porter and eventually two shutters opened on the bar. It was Monday before the occasion began to seep fully into the mind. Now it was real. *** The Moy was packed and when Derry bus-driver Benny Vincent opened the door - in came Plunkett Donaghy. The previous season, he spilled Anthony Tohill’s ‘’ into the net in the league final to start the ball rolling on Derry’s odyssey. This was dferent. This was a tribute to the sons of Ulster bringing home the Sam. “You had the Garda escort coming out of Dublin and you were stopping in every town,” McGilligan recalls. “There were thousands of people waiting on us on a lorry in every town on the way up.” In Cookstown there was a Loyalist road block. Plan B was to ert via Coalisland. But McGilligan instructed Vincent to head on up the town – as far as they could go. There were thousands of Tyrone people wanting a glance at Sam. “It was unheard of for a team from the North. Down had done it before and it wasn’t new to them - it was new to Derry.” The homecoming seemed to go on forever. In every town, before they were greeted by the huge crowd in Maghera, outside Glen club, before the cup was taken to the four corners of the county. When it was McGilligan’s turn to have the cup, he paraded it around the homes of the Benedy. Back to the days when Liam Harry came rounding him up to make up the numbers. His career had now come full circle. He hosted a night in his house. It was packed, with cars strewn alongside the road. “There was a death up in the Benedy,” added McGilligan, remembering the night vividly. A stranger to the area saw the commotion and stopped off. “He said to somebody ‘where’s the remains at’ – he saw all the cars and thought it was the wake house. He laughed and away he went.” *** The glory days ended abruptly. With Ciaran McCabe’s winning goal for Down in , Derry’s world came crashing down. There was no back door and Derry’s All-Ireland dreams were in tatters. McGilligan laments the  years since meeting Sam. “Any other county would have got their act together. Too many boys partied, lived the high le and thought it was only matter of turning up. “We definitely should have won another one. The players were good enough, you can’t pinpoint any one thing. It was the perfect storm. There was a whole lot of things going on behind. You see where things have gone,” he continued. “We are still as far away from winning another one. We are starting from the bottom again – we are in ision four.” That aside, McGilligan is content on how his GAA career panned out. “It kept me on the straight and narrow. Everybody has their vices and the GAA was a vice for me. If it wasn’t football it was hurling.” Nulling the impact of Joe Beattie, punching home a county final winning goal and answering Kevin Heffernan’s call tofrom America. The important markers in the career of one of Derry’s famous sons. RELATED - Gerry McElhinney - the greatest showman. Click here...

The working paper has been drafted following a video conference between all three parties on Tuesday when the PFAI submitted a high-level paper prepared by their world governing body FIFPRO on protocols around player safety. Those recommendations have now been incorporated into the FAI’s working document - entitled ‘Return To Football – Behind Closed Doors’ - around best practice for the staging of matches when senior Irish football gets the green light to resume action from the HealthService Executive . googletag.cmd.push This document incorporates all elements around the safe staging of games behind closed doors to ensure the health and safety of players, match officials and club employees and volunteers. All clubs have been asked to assess the document andtheir views to the working group. NLEC chairperson Noel Byrne said: “This working document is the next step in assessing what is best for Irish footballthe HSE and the Government give the green light for ato action, but behind closed doors. The document is the produce of very fruitful, positive and considered talks between the NLEC, the FAI and the PFAI. googletag.cmd.push “It is vital that we examine what is needed in the event of games going on in closed stadiums, from a health and safety perspective for all stakeholders and from a financial aspect as far as the clubs are concerned. This document, produced by all stakeholders working together, presents options to the clubs and we look forward to their views when they have had a chance to study the document.” PFAI General Secretary Stephen McGuinness said: “We welcome the opportunity to be part of this very important debate in these dficult times for Irish football. Our players are keen to support the efforts of the FAI and the NLEC to examine ato football in a manner that is safe for all involved be they players, match officials or club staff. “The FIFPRO document is a high-level recommendation and the FAI have put together the fine details of what playing behind closed doors looks like for all concerned. This is very much a work in progress with all stakeholders working together towards the best solution possible for our game in the event of a closed doors recommendation from the HSE and Government.” The FAI and the NLEC remain committed to looking at alternative income streams for SSE Airtricity League clubs in the event of ato National League football behind closed doors, with live streaming opportunities under discussion. Interim Deputy CEO of the FAI, Niall Quinn said: “The working document presented to the clubs today offers a real  for debate about ato football when we get the go-ahead from Government and health officials. They will of course have the final say on when weand under what circumstances, but it is imperative on us as a working group to present the best options available to our clubs. “This document offers the clubs an insight into best practice for staging games behind closed doors. The Association also remains committed to exploring the best financial proposition available to our clubs and players at this time. Analysis of the financial impact of playing behind doors is well underway with our clubs and we are examining potential revenue streams from live streaming and other sources. This is a united effort and we look forward to further engagement with the NLEC, the PFAI, the referees and the clubs themselves.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The response to the classes has been brilliant and I have kept it on, even though I am teaching PE full-time in Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch.ldquoObviously with COVID- I am off work now and with no GAA or fitness classes I have more time on my hands.ldquoI put out the idea on social media on Friday morning and then spent the weekend putting together the first class to upload Monday morning.ldquoI honestly didnrsquot know what to expect really. I was thinking maybeI managed to pull in a hundred people at pound each, pound would be a reasonable target.But I have really been overwhelmed by the response.Members of her usual weekly classes in Pilates for Paula responded immediately, but her school quickly weighed in behind the effort and her many acquaintances in GAA and camogie.Despite her organisation of the fundraiser, in her words being ldquoa bit last minute, her target was realised eight-fold and she presented a cheque for pound, last week.ldquoI couldnrsquot believe it really. When I saw Instagram stories of Sophie Colgan in New York taking part, Eiliacutes Niacute Chaiside [the Slaughtneil camog], who has been in New Zealand for the past year, signing up, and Sarah Donnelly, the Tyrone footballer in Australia, it just shows you that the people you meet through the GAA will always support each other.Paula last year captained Clonduff to the All-Ireland club title and she has played for Down and Ulster over many years, while her husband Darren is the Down football captain.ldquoThe GAA camogie community is absolutely fabulous. They rallied around my family after Christmas and provided a lot of comfort and again the response has been phenomenal.ldquoCOVID- has challenged the family once more. Clodaghrsquos parents, my brother Darren and his we Carol, live in Coleraine and it has been very dficult for us as a family to support them. What has happened over Easter week has given us all a huge lt and we are very thankful for all that support from our GAA family.ldquoI have got a lot of messages since the last class on Friday and everyone seems to have enjoyed them. A lot had never done exercise like that and now want me to provide more classes online and keep it going for as long as we are all prevented from going back to work.ldquoI think plenty of people are finding the lockdown very tough mentally and I got that back in the messages too, about how they felt a lot more positive after doing the exercise, a lot fresher and ready to face the day.She added: ldquoThe people who supported the fundraiser have helped themselves, helped Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI Research and really supported the Gribben family.You can still contribute to Leukaemia Lymphonania Research by searching for Carol and Darren Gribbenrsquos fundraiser in aid of Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI on Facebook or follow this link https:www.facebook donate  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Delamont.jpg","title":"Delamont remains closed in lockdown  ","story":"DELAMONT Country Park outside Killyleagh is to remain closed to visitors.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has confirmed that the gates to the stunning park on the shores of Strangford Lough will not reopen, despite last weekrsquos decision by Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots to reopen Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks.The decision not to allow visitors into Delamont was taken by the leaders of the local councilrsquos main parties during a meeting held via Skype last week and has been welcomed by local councillors Billy Walker and Dermot Curran.Cllr Walker said all the party leaders agreed that is it too soon to reopen Delamont, confirming that the closure decision will be reviewed next month.ldquoThere are real concerns that allowing the public to access the country park could lead to a major surge in visitors which is not what anyone wants at this particular time. The last thing we need is for family picnics and hundreds of other visitors arriving at a time when coronavirus remains a very real and present danger, continued the Rowallane councillor.Cllr Walker described the decision to reopen forest parks as ldquopremature and said Newry, Mourne and Down Council deserved praise for keeping all its country parks closed for the time being.He added: ldquoThe closure decision is being kept under review and I believe that there is still some way to go before council-owned parks will be open to the public.ldquoThere will be people upset that Delamont remains closed, but we all have to adhere to the public advice we have been given in relation to social distancing and, where possible, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Cllr Curran said he supports the decision to keep Delamont closed and praised what he described as the local authorityrsquos ldquocourageous decision.He argued that the big danger with warmer weather and clearer evenings now here is that reopening the country park could lead to a major influx of visitors and that enforcing social distancing measures would be particularly dficult,not impossible.ldquoThere was perhaps a temptation to reopen Delamont given the decision to allow people to access Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks, but the local council has stood firm, putting the safety of people front and centre and is to be applauded for doing so, said Cllr Curran.ldquoErring on the side of caution is the right thing to do at this time. It would be an awful situation to reopen the park and for someone to contract coronavirus as a result. The park will reopen at some stage, but not just now. Peoplersquos health and safety must come first.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said despite the decision by Mr Poots to reopen parks managed by the Forest Service all those that the local authority is responsible for, including Delamont, will remain closed.Council officials say that the decision to close Delamont taken on March  remains in place for the time being, but will be reviewed as public health advice guidance develops.ldquoMembers decided that it was too soon to consider reopening parks at this time, said a council spokesman.In addition, he said it was felt that reopening local authority-owned country park would encourageresidents from outside the district to make a non-essential journey to these facilities for exercise, thus increasing the volume of traffic and congestion at these locations and increasing the risk of further spread of COVID- across the district.ldquoThe focus of the council at this time must be the safety of our citizens and implementing measures to reduce the spread of the virus, said the spokesman.ldquoThe council continues to advise our citizens that the single most important action they can take is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Doreen.jpg","title":"Doreen to step down after 20 years as leader at Leitrim playgroup  ","story":"A LEITRIM woman, who has been the driving force behind a local playgroup for almost  years, is stepping down.Doreen Shahmohammadi is a familiar face around the village, especially to young people as the leader of Leitrim Community Playgroup.Doreen, her Iranian husband, Reza, and twin sons, Michael and Colm, settled in Leitrim a few years before she began the playgroup in January . She soon experienced a strong sense of community and friendship that has kept them there ever since.She started the playgroup with the support of the local GAA club, Liatroim Fontenoys, which offered her use of their premises to begin with.ldquoIn the first year we went from having five children to  children, she said. ldquoWe had no funding in the first year, but the Fontenoys were very good to us by covering the cost of heating and telephone charges.ldquoBy the second year funding was made available by the Southern Education and Library Board for  pre-school places and it wasnrsquot long before we secured funding to build a purpose-built playgroup which sits within the boundary of the Fontenoys club.ldquoWithin a few years and thanks to additional funding enrolment rose to  places. Depending on the birth rate it has usually remains around the same number each year.Doreen loves to have children around her. In fact, Reza reminds her all the time that she is a magnet in attracting them wherever she goes.Doreen is a very proud mother. Her sons, now , graduated as doctors five years ago and both are working on the frontline during the COVID- pandemic. Colm is working in intensive care, while Michael works between cardiology and intensive care.ldquoOver the years, I have loved, cared for and educated every child that has come to the playgroup as though they were my own children, he says.ldquoI am going to miss them all very much, more than you can ever imagine. I hope Irsquom not to be a stranger to the playgroup after my retirement.Doreen says the current playgroup team, made up of deputy leader Michelle McCabe and temporary assistant, Danielle Clarke, have worked well together over the past few years. Other long term members of staff were Janet King, Tina Owens and Diane Baxter.ldquoThe playgroup has been my le and I have enjoyed welcoming hundreds of children to their pre-school year experience. It is a lovely learning environment to be part of, she continued.ldquoWe are blessed with the children and their families in the community who have entered our setting and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff and committees past and present, children, grandparents, childminders and, of course, the wider community who have supported me and who have been so generous over the years.ldquoMost of all, I would like to thank the trustees who have supported me for all these years and provided me with the opportunity to establish an excellent learning environment for pre-school children, not forgetting my sincere thanks to the Fontenoys for all their support and encouragement.She added: ldquoI wish my successor every success and I hope they will enjoy and appreciate every single minute they spend with the children as I have done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Life.jpg","title":"Ex Drumaness man praises Kiwis as country comes out of lockdown  ","story":"A FORMER Drumaness man who has been living in New Zealand for the past  years has this week revealed what le in lockdown has been like Down Under.Barry Brennanrsquos adopted homeland has been praised for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, with the country this week emerging from a strict five-week quarantine which included the strictest constraints paced on New Zealanders in modern history.The countryrsquos prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, hailed New Zealanders for their incredible work to ldquobreak the virusrsquos chain of transmission which has allowed the country to downgrade its highest alert level from four to three, with amendedrestrictions expected to be in place for around two more weeks.The move means that many shops have reopened while public gatherings of  people are now permissible for weddings and funerals, with schools also set to reopen. In addition, Kiwis can now fish, hunt, surf, swim and play golf.New Zealand has suffered only , confirmed coronavirus cases and  deaths after moving quickly to impose a lockdown last month, with the easing of quarantine measures paving the way for around , people toto work under a more relaxed regime.Barry mdash who specialises in home renovations and employs several people mdash has not ed to work yet, but is more than happy in the idyllic rural setting of Mangawhai in the North Island just five minutes from the beach, where he lives with his we, Sian, and children Sean, Danny and Liam.The New Zealand government is still asking citizens to stay at home and to practise social distancing, with Barry hoping that it wonrsquot be long before the country again enjoys some sense of normality.And he has the praised prime minister for her approach to COVID-, with Arden arguing that a drastic short-term action would benefit the countryrsquos economy in the long run.On Monday, it was confirmed that there is no widespread underlying community transmission in New Zealand, with Ms Arden warning that the country was not yet out of the woods.ldquoWhen you look at what happened where in the world in relation to coronavirus, the prime minister did a good job, said Barry, who headed to New Zealand with his friend Barry Armstrong in .ldquoI was a qualied carpenter and Barry, who lived just up the road from me, was a bricklayer who had a contact in New Zealand so we headed off on a -month visa to Auckland. Barry stayed for  months before heading home but I am still here, married with three boys.ldquoThe coronavirus has had a worldwide impact and while many people were wondering what would happen in New Zealand, I always had a feeling that the prime minister would go at the pandemic hard and fast and that is exactly what she did.Barry revealed that New Zealanders were told to prepare for lockdown on March  and that two days later a series of strict measures were introduced.ldquoClearly the prime minister had a look at what was happening in other parts of the world before the virus got a hold here and she moved to minimise its impact. I think that she has done an amazing job to be quite honest.ldquoFour and a half weeks after the lockdown measures were implemented, there was only one confirmed coronavirus case in New Zealand at the start of this week. Indeed, the government knows exactly where every case is in the country.Barry said anyone arriving in the country and is suspected of having the virus is quarantined and believes thatthere was ever to be another pandemic in the future, countries would do well to take a close look at what New Zealand did to halt its deadly spread.ldquoEverything really happened so fast here and we did not have that much time to think about what was going in, he continued.ldquoI played golf with the principal of the school my youngest boy attends and he said he did not think NewZealand would go into lockdown. Forty eight hours later we were told it was happening.Barry said the country rightly decided that it wasnrsquot taking any chances and locked everything down, apart from supermarkets, with strict social distancing rules in place.ldquoWe have gone from a level four alert to level three but I am still not back at work as there a lot of iables that I need to consider, explained the former Drumaness man. ldquoIn my line of work I would be close to homeowners so I will just wait until the restrictions ease a bit more.Barry relocated from Auckland to Mangawhai six years ago and home is now a three and a half acre plot where he built a shooting gallery and what he describes as a ldquobit of a golf course. He also looks after a few animals.With no immediateto work on the horizon, Barry is keeping busy mowing lawns and feeding his animals, with a little help from his sons.With his parents, Sean and Mary, still living at the family home at the Cumber Road in Drumaness, Barry says he is in regular contact with them. He said his dad is good with Whatsapp and regularly tells him that New Zealand lamb is cheaper in Ireland than down under.ldquoWe have lots of contact with my parents and are in touch once or twice a week. I also have an older brother, Seamus who lives in Auckland. We both played for Loughinisland GAC. I also keep up-to-date with what is going there via social media and stuff, he continued.ldquoMy brother, Mark, is a former Loughinisland club chairman who was involved in the plans for building the new clubhouse. I also keep tabs on Down GAArsquos fortunes.As Barry waits for the right time toto work, he said that during the lockdown, New Zealanders mostly did what they were told.He added: ldquoThey were sensible and the approach has worked as things are slowly ing to normal, but we know that we have a little way to go yet..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 29%2C 1980  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ndash A new library for Newcastle is to be given priority soon by the South Eastern Education Board, it was claimed this week.The claim came from Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, who said she believed that Board members realised they had made a bad mistake and are now prepared to reverse their attitude.Mrs Smyth, addressing a meeting of Down councillors on Monday, explained that she had recently asked the Board for an undertaking that the Newcastle Library project would be given a priority rating for new capital schemes.ldquoI think the whole Board realised they made a bad mistake and they are quite willing to go ahead and get something done quickly, said Mrs Smyth.Mrs Smyth made her surprise announcement after Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue attacked the Boardrsquos attitude over a new library for the seaside town.Mr OrsquoDonoghue claimed that an original Board decision to put Newcastle on a low priority rating was taken without consulting the Boardrsquos chief librarian who was in favour of early attention for Newcastle.He called the lack of consultation and criticised the Board for not responding fully to points raised by a council deputation several months ago.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Ballynahinch Chamber of Commerce is beginning to draw up plans for another trade week ndash and such was the success of the last venture that itrsquos been decided to extend this yearrsquos event to ten days.The dates being set aside for the trade week are Thursday, June th to Saturday, June st, and it is hoped that the townrsquos traders will offer many bargains to help attract business.Last yearrsquos trade week was a major success and most businesses in the town have reaped the benefit since. New customers were attracted to the town and quality goods and competitive prices have encouraged many toon a regular basis.The growing stature of the town as a shopping centre has been helped by the introduction of new shops, particularly in the Dromore Street area, and by the good car parking facilities on offer.Market Day every Thursday brings hundreds of people from the surrounding district flooding into the town ndash and with two Market Days cropping up in the new extended trade week this year, the Chamber is hopeful that shopping will hit a new peak in June.QUOILE ndash A concerted effort is being made by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Down District Council to make the -mile stretch of the Quoile River into a fishing paradise.Regarded as one of the best fishing waters in the province, the Quoile is hardly known nationally, and itrsquos the aim of the Tourist Board and the council to make it as popular as the Fermanagh Lakelands, the current number one fishing haven.The joint effort to put the Quoile on the fishing map is being spearheaded by Ian Heaps, the former inidual world champion angler and current member of the English international team, who has been carrying out a survey over the past ten days.And his report could influence the Tourist Board to pump more money into publicising the Quoile to world-wide anglers.Already Heaps has spent ten days fishing the Quoile and its ancillary waters ndash and his expert opinion is that itrsquos one of the best that Northern Ireland has to offer.KILLYLEAGH ndash The Vikings ed to invade Killyleagh this week ndash but this time it was a more peaceful visit.The invaders, instead of arriving by longship to pillage and plunder, came to look over youth provision in the area and they left totally impressed by the friendly reception they received.The unlikely invaders were a group of youth workers from Norway and Spain, who visited the area as part of a five-day study of youth work and facilities in the province.Local stops were at the Seaboard Sailing Centre in Killyleagh, Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre in Castlewellan and Downpatrick Folk Club.Tuesday afternoon and night was spent in the area, with the first stop for the Norwegians being at the Seaboard centre.STRANGFORD ndash The recently formed Strangford Village Improvement Committee is to seek public support to have an order enforcing the one-way system in the village revoked.The committee discussed the system at their monthly meeting on Thursday and, after hearing of the failure of a meeting between the Department of Environment officials, traffic police and RUC representatives to have something done about it, they decided that the support of the public is needed.The committee chairman told members that the top level meeting had fallen on deaf ears and that nothing could be done about the situation.They had discussed the possibility of altering the system, the ious proposals which the committee had made as alternatives to it, and the fact that the majority of residents did not want the system.Unfortunately the Department rejected all the committeersquos proposals and insisted that the system, in its present form, would have to remain, said the chairman.The chairman had askedthe one-way system would not be made permanent until all attempts to accommodate the residentrsquos wishes had been made but the Department replied that the systemis already permanentand had been made so by Government order. Nothing could be done about it unless the order was revoked.KILLINCHY ndash The st Killinchy Company of the Boys Brigade held its th annual display in the Church Hall on Friday evening.Chairman for the evening was the Rev R A McKee, the inspecting officer was Mr C T Johnston, of st Cargycreevy, and the presentation of prizes was made by Mrs M Moles.The company gave the usual high standard display, with a ied programme of drill, games and sketches, before captain, Raymond Finlay, gave his annual report.Three boys received their Queens Badges, the highest award in the BB, namely Alistair Davidson, Robin Thompson and Samuel Dines.Three had also received their presidentrsquos badges, namely Bill Dunlop, Wesley Blythe and Andrew Bishop, and four had received their Duke of Edinburgh bronze awards, namely David Morrow, Mark Davidson, Robin Thompson and Robert McBurney.DOWNPATRICK ndash A breathtaking two-hour pageant is being drawn up as the centrepiece of this yearrsquos St Patrickrsquos Festival in Downpatrick.An outdoor site has already been chosen and plans are well advanced to produce a startling display of battle scenes, comedy scenes, music and games.And to show they mean business the organisers have appointed one of the countryrsquos leading stage producers, Mr Michael Poynor, to act as a full-time director.The site, which is near the Quoile, will resemble a giant film set with authentic costumes and props depicting the time of the earliest settlers in Lecale to the arrival of the Normans.CASTLEWELLAN ndash Kilmegan Youth Club, Castlewellan, triumphed in the final of the South Eastern Education and Library Board Youth Club quiz held in Downpatrick on Monday night.

The online sales are set to continue as marts across the province begin to reopen.Cllr Lewis said the marts have a crucial role to play, allowing farmers to buy and sell livestock, at what is a traditionally a busy time of the year for them. Crucially, he said reopening marts will help with their respective incomes.He said there was ldquosignicant concern when the marts closed last month, with farmers expressing concern that they could find themselves overstocked with animals, particularly store cattle and ped calves.ldquoNews of the gradual reopening of local marts is an important development and will be widely welcomed across the agricultural sector at this time, said Cllr Lewis.The Slieve Croob councillor said DAERA was to be applauded for its decision, particularly given the key role farmers play in supplying the local food chain.ldquoIt is essential that in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public, he continued.ldquoAt this time of year, many farmers are seeking to purchase stock for the grazing season and obviously others are selling their stock through the marts. Dairy farms will also find themselves overstocked with dropped calves that they would normally be selling.Cllr Lewis said there were farmers wishing to sell and buy livestock and it was ldquovital in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public.A DAERA spokesman said farmers were key workers and were continuing to provide food for everyone in ldquovery challenging circumstances with part of the food supply chain the ability to trade and sell animals.ldquoStaff within the department have maintained regular contact with livestock mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements, he continued.ldquoFarmers, like all businesses, are facing financial dficulties as a result of COVID-. Being able to trade again at the marts will provide much needed cash flow..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Into.jpg","title":"Into the Blues   Jake signs pro contract with Linfield  ","story":"A TEENAGE local footballer says hersquos ldquoover the moon after signing professional terms with Linfield.Eighteen year-old Jake Corbett, from Dromara, has signed his first professional contract with the Blues after some stellar performances for Linfield Swts.The exciting young player has scored around  goals this season, despite playing in midfield.And he also helped the Swts lt the Steel  Sons Cup as they beat Newington - in the Christmas Day showdown.Jake, who joined the Windsor Park outfit three years ago, has been football mad since the age of ten.He played youth football for Dromore Amateurs, then broke his way into the clubrsquos first team and played in the Amateur League.After spells with Banbridge Town, Lisburn Distillery and Crusaders he joined Linfield at the age of .An attacking central midfielder, he made an immediate impact and firmly established himself in the Swts set-up.His prowess has also earned international honours.

In many ways, itrsquos strange to think that by staying home I can save a le.My sister, Martina, loved le, but she was only  when she passed away in . Seasonal flu was the culprit which overwhelmed her body. COVID- is a frightening virus for the world to contend with. But it is especially frightening for people like me.Martina and I were born with spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic muscle wasting condition which robs people of the ability to walk, eat and breathe.I now live an active, productive le, thanks to many interventions that started in my childhood. I had a tube ed into my stomach to ensure that I could get the nutrients I could no longer eat as half of the muscles I use to swallow became paralysed. I also began using a non-invasive ventilator.COVID- has been on our radar since the beginning of January. I could do little but watch and wait. The plans would not be much dferent than my usual flu-time plans which ensure that I am in protective bubble, which allows my family to do everything it can to maintain an infection-free environment around me.Sure enough, almost  days ago, it was time to take action, with the Hollywood lockdown coming almost two weeks before it was implemented for everyone . And within a few days of the official lockdown beginning, I was also furloughed from work at a leading charity for people with conditions like mine.This has been one of the most emotionally and mentally dficult parts of the pandemic for me personally. Since I was  I have been working with and for this charity to improve lives. But within a few short days my le had drastically changed.Last September, I took eight flights in three weeks as I was selected for an Emerging Leaders programme by the US State Department for my work with disabled people and for a national conference for people with conditions like mine in London.Now, I have to stay within the bounds of my driveway. I can only go outside because my neighbours are all so far away. A small mercy.It quickly became obvious that getting food and other essential supplies was not going to be easy. Large supermarkets only started offering registration to extremely vulnerable customers a few weeks in to the lockdown.Before lockdown began few,any supermarkets offered a dedicated shopping time to extremely vulnerable customers, making getting food dficult during a time when it was flying off the shelves in panic buying.Crossgarrsquos SuperValu store got us through those first few weeks as it was able to deliver some essentials, while Gordons Pharmacy in Downpatrick has been delivering to us for some time now. But the pharmacyrsquos willingness to collect our preions has been a huge weight off our shoulders.I have now been able to register the family with Sainsburyrsquos for deliveries of other items we need to keep us ticking over, while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos food delivery package service has been much more successful than those in other parts of the UK.The one that we have received included food that I could eat ndash something many of my friends in the rest of the UK are not so lucky with. The parcel is one small, yet very important part of the support our government is offering that it has got right, even though it has only been in place for us for three weeks.It took us several weeks to set up everything we needed, but I know that many others are still trying and are having to take drastic, le-endangering measures to keep it going.However, COVID- is not just a negative in the lives of disabled people.Virtual concerts, musicals on YouTube for all and even online quiz nights have become the new normal of socialising.Many jobs and educational institutions have moved staff to work from home and online, something that some disabled people were often refused when they asked for it. Even the community spirit and volunteering has left us feeling overwhelmed with offers of help.It is my hope that we can use this opportunity to see what our future can be.A more accepting and inclusive society, where disabled people can fully take part.

Unfortunately after all of the hard work of labour, I had to have a C-section and James Patrick was born at .pm on Tuesday. Ryan was allowed into the recovery room with me for two hours, but after that he didnrsquot see me or the baby until Thursday afternoon when we were allowed home.Prospective parents have been told that only one birth partner is currently allowed into the delivery ward, but onlythey are well and show no signs of coronavirus.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoApart from the labour and the C-section, it was a positive experience. I think I was more anxious in the days coming up to the birth as I didnrsquot know what the restrictions would mean. In hindsight, it wasnrsquot that bad and it was probably worse for Ryan sitting at home. He rang his sister who has four children and asked when she thought he could do and she said clean the house.Baby James Patrick was only one day overdue, but Mrs Lawlor was delighted that he decided to make an appearance when he did. A clue to his birth weight may be due to his mother being ft  inches tall, while dad Ryanis ft  inches.While Mrs Lawlor did not have to wear a face mask during her labour, but the midwives who attended her afterwards were masked.She said: ldquoI suppose as this was an all-new experience for both Ryan and I we have nothing to compare it to.ldquoI remember waking up the next day, not that I slept that much in the night, and thought, lsquoOh no, I have a whole day by myself in here with this brand new babyrsquo. But the nurses and midwives are coming that often to do a iety of checks that the days went quite fast.ldquoHowever, I remember that I felt the second night in hospital was awfully long and I really struggled with dealing with James. Normally,you have a bit of help during the day and night, you can manage better to get a bit of sleep.ldquoThe strangest thing was seeing quite a few of the staff with masks and visors on. While they were all lovely, you lost a bit of the personal touch and connection with them because of the masks. Sometimesthey were maintaining social distancing and werenrsquot close to you, you couldnrsquot actually see who it was. The staff were all wonderful but you didnrsquot know what they looked like.As a sportswoman, who used to play for Loughinisland GACrsquos senior ladies and at county level, Mrs Lawlor is recovering well after the birth. Her husband is also well-known in local sporting circles as hersquos on the executive committee of Loughinisland GAC.They are becoming accustomed to the lsquonewrsquo normal at home of being first-time parents amid the lockdown.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoWe have had visitors to the house looking through the window at the baby. Itrsquos still hard for everyone as my sister is itching to get a wee cuddle and all our family members want to hold him. That canrsquot happen for very good reasons and I donrsquot know when that will change. Thatrsquos one of the strange things about having a baby in the lockdown.ldquoHowever, the simplicity of le today is quite nice. I think itrsquos possibly the best time to have a baby. We have plenty to keep ourselves busy with James Patrick in the lockdown and therersquos nothing  to distract us.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Ciara.jpg","title":"Portaferry athlete takes lockdown in her stride  ","story":"CIARA Mageeanrsquos Olympic ambitions may have been put on hold owing to coronavirus, but shersquos taking the lockdown in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig.

I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Railway.jpg","title":"Railway vandals condemned  ","story":"VANDALS have struck at the heritage steam railway in Downpatrick.The window of a railway carriage was smashed with a concrete block some time over the weekend.The damage was discovered by a volunteer at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway premises on Monday morning.Part of a concrete block was found inside the carriage along with evidence that the vandals had been smoking.

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reality is we will look at the medical evidence. The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well. Itrsquoll be a decision that all four nations take together based on the evidence, he said.Mr. Lewis said he was aware of the complexities of Northern Irelandrsquos Border with the Republic of Ireland amid the pandemic, explaining that he has been meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney.ldquoEven where there are dferences in the approach between the Republic and the North,there are,we know that we can make sure we are clear with residents why those dferences are there.ldquoThe challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that.An investigation in The Sunday Times at the weekend featured a Whitehall source claiming the government ldquomissed the boat on testing and PPEand ldquojust watched as the death toll mounted in Wuhan, China.The report also claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five crucial COBRA meetings in the Cabinet Office in London.When asked to respond to these serious allegations, Mr. Lewis said: ldquoI didnrsquot recognise some of what I saw in the Times.ldquoI was in the Cobra meetings in January and February COBRA meetings are chaired by the Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland. Wersquove been able to supply that itrsquos in good order. I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Neil McCarthy says the anonymous doctor quoted in the News Letter \"simply revealed something that has been reported in US and Great Britain hospitals that medical staff have almost nothing to do\"Sinn Féin have even seen themselves successfully outflanked on an all Ireland approach to Covid- by the DUPin relation to families being able to visit the graves of their loved ones . With contact tracing set to resume shortly throughout the UK, any dferences between the approaches of the two administrations on this island have all but vanished and death rates from the disease in the two jurisdictions are almost identical. So there is now space to look at this crisis beyond the politics of Orange and Green. Neil McCarthy is a writer and teacher based in Dublin and London : Other rd Party \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Two remarkable things have happened here in the last few days. First, Michelle O’Neill let slip at a news conference last Friday that, in her view, social distancing “[is] going to be a feature of our lives for perhaps up to a couple of years and beyond”. That this was not some uninformed solo run has been made clear in comments made to this newspaper by Queen’s University, Belfast medical professor Dr Ultan Power and expert virologist Dr Connor Bamford, also of QUB, in the days since. Both made comments broadly compatible with what the deputy first minister said. The second remarkable thing was the anonymous interview given to this newspaper by a doctor who has worked in one of Northern Ireland’s dedicated Covid- centres and published earlier this week. Doctors on Covid wards sitting around with nothing to do – whilst NI hospitals are nearly emptied of regular patients,’ April He simply revealed something that has been widely reported on in American hospitals and hospitals outside of the larger cities in Great Britain: that medical staff have almost nothing to do whilst people with legitimate non-coronavirus symptoms are not visiting out of fear. These are facts. PUP man and retired GP John Kyle has echoed his comments. Yet it would seem that these comments have brought on quite the backlash, to the extent that it was deemed necessary for an editorial comment to be released by the News Letter  to counter any possible offence taken, albeit that the editorial focussed on the doctor’s personal view that these facts meant for him that the lockdown is “doing at least as much harm as good”. I would add that on Channel  news this Wednesday evening, the second part of a special report showing how Craigavon Area General Hospital is dealing with the crisis contained an arresting moment when the director of Emergency Medicine took the reporter Paraic O’Brien into the special Accident and Emergency for respiratory patients and revealed it to be empty. When O’Brien expressed surprise, the director paused and said: “To see it empty is … unsettling.” These local developments are remarkable in my view because they show that even though the disease is clearly in retreat in Northern Ireland at the moment, there appears to be a stultying orthodoxy taking hold in our political and medical decision making circles. Social distancing is here to stay for the foreseeable future. The lockdown is here to stay for a good while too, and even when it comes to an end, it may well be followed by new ones should there be any upswing in cases. The ‘indirect’ costs of the lockdownare not to be talked about and our hospitals are, for the time being, for Covid patients and Covid patients alone. Bear in mind three sets of newly issued statistics this week: for cancer patients in the UK as a whole the Dailyreports that “lack of treatment during the coronavirus crisis” may lead to , excess cancer deaths in the next year British Airways have announced that they are planning to lay off, not furlough, , of their staffBBC health correspondent Nick Triggle has revealed that University of Bristol researchers have posited that a .% decline in the size of the economy is a “tipping point” whichreached would see a loss of three months of le on average across the population. These three terrying statistics were all released on the same day this week: Wednesday April th, one day after the anonymous doctor’s interview.The critical sentence uttered by that doctor, and the one that got this newspaper into trouble, was, let us remind ourselves, this: “the lockdown is doing at least as much harm as good.”You must admit, the good doctor certainly had a point.• Neil McCarthy is a writer and teacher based in Dublin and London• Editorial April :  ‘Lockdown has been an entirely appropriate precautionary response to a health crisis’• Neil McCarthy March : Some voices in Ireland have used Covid to cast Britain as backward—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

He was also a big figure in all our lives and I would like to extend a special welcome to Tony’s we Mary, to his sons Stephen and Conor, to his daughters Cathy and Laura.“Tony’s death was not unexpected but even so there are just no easy words we can say to take away the pain.“It is a time of heartache, a time of tears. All we can do today is be whatever comfort we can to you at this dficult time.“Anyone who knew Tony ‘Archie’ Moore will know that he loved the social event of a big Wake and attended many a funeral in his day and yet here we are with just his family and a few friends here in this church.“It seems so surreal but as you all know we are living in strange times due to the restrictions imposed on us by the Coronavirus pandemic.“If these were normal times, this church would be overflowing such was Tony’s popularity.“He was first and foremost a giant of the community and the irony is, as much as he would have loved a big send off, he would have wanted us to do our best to respect the guidelines, to keep people safe and healthy at this unusual time.“Thanks to the wonders of technology, many of you in the community are watching online.”He also welcome members of Tony’s family from Australia who are also watching online.“We were all deeply saddened that Tony has left us and it is dficult to let go of the man we came to know and love.“We are privileged to be able to gather together as his family and friends here and online to pray for him.“Someone once said everyone gets to preach at their own funeral by the way they lived their le.“Well knowing Tony as I did, the man he was I believe he will preach very well.”He refered to the Gospel which was on the Beatitudes and said Tony was ‘keenly aware’ of all the blessings.“Those quality Jesus mentions became a lived reality for him.“He was keenly aware of all of the blessings God had given him and he was proud to share them with everyone he knew.“Today we mourn the death of Tony but we also celebrate a le well lived.“Tony was a man who loved le. His family was incredibly important to him and was one of the things that distinguished him and helped define who he was as a man. He loved his we Mary, his children and his grandchildren. There is nothing he wouldn’t do for them. The pain upon us is real but so is the joy.“Each one of you here and each one of you watching online have a story to tell about Tony. “We can look back at the times when Tony was so kind to so many, brightened and enriched lives.“We can see in him love through his love for others. We can see in him compassion, honesty, integrity and courtesy and how everyone was special to him. We can see in him his wonderful sense of humour. his smile and infectious laugh which lted all our spirits.”He spoke of how fondly people spoke of Tony on Facebook, describing him as ‘an absolute gentleman’.“He always had time for everbody. He was generous to a fault, always the first to give. He was a superb neighbour. He was one of le’s real gems. He was one of le’s good guys. He was always fun-loving. He was a great man to know. He never passed you by. Always ready for a chat. He was a wonderful human being and a real friend to all who knew him. He was one of the nicest people put on this earth.“These are just some of the hundreds of comments posted on Facebook. Comments from so many who will feel his loss keenly because of the person he was and with his unique gts he touched all our lives.“Tony was indeed a person who had a great abundance of humanity. He cared about people all his le.“He was born in Shankill in Lurgan whre he grew up but he would spend most of his le living in Craigavon.“He started his working career with Farrens then went to work in the Goodyear factory when it opened in  til its closure.“He was one of the founding members of the Goodyear Sports and Social Club and he will be remembered by many as the ‘Captain of the Ship’ at the Goodyear SSC where he facilitated s that raised thousands of pounds for charities.“He loved and enjoyed the craic and banter with all the people who came through the door over the years.“Tony had a great love for young people and when he was younger he worked as a volunteer youth leader for many years.“He was also a keen supporter of Armagh, Clan na Gael and Eire Og. He loved the GAA. He was a true Gael.“Tony Moore was truly special and that came from something within. And that something was his faith. Tony was a man of immense faith. He embraced his Catholic faith. His whole le was founded on a deep unshakeable faith.“I had the privilege of knowing Tony. He was a great friend to me and I can pay him no greater compliment when I say he was one of the best people you’d ever meet and it was a pleasure knowing him. He was one of le’s true gents. Quite simply, he was a legend who warmed our hearts and we were all privileged to have our lives touched by him.“Tony should have got a real good send off and I know the whole of Craigavon will come to a standstill as he gave everything to the people of Craigavon and beyond. But sadly that can’t be because of this awful virus.“He will be a big loss.”Anthony Moore was the beloved husband of Mary and much loved father of Stephen, Connor, Cathy and Laura, beloved father-in-law of Claire, Joanne, Gary and Cormac and a loving granda to Oísin, Naoise, Tristan, Christine, Clodagh, Cillian, Caoimhe, Caitlin, Ciarán, Jack, and Líodhna, and beloved brother of Anne and Margaret and the late William and Jim R.I.P.After his funeral at St Anthony’s Church, interment was in St Colman’s Cemetery Lurgan.Due to Current Circumstances House and Funeral Strictly Private for Immediate Family Only Please.No flowers please, donations in lieudesired to St Anthony’s Church Craigavon c o Jack McLearnon  Son Funeral Directors  North Street, Lurgan BT AH.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
