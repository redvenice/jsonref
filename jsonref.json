It’s the way older homeowners can boost their finances and help turn their lives around in retirement. It’s called equity release. And if you’re over 55 then it could work for you. Here are the SEVEN key facts every homeowner aged 55 and over should know... ONE: It’s all about releasing tax-free cash tied up in the value of your home While some people choose to downsize, many are retiring and finding their homes are worth more than their pension funds. Equity release lets you access the money in your home, just like turning 55 lets you access the cash in your pension. The money you release from your home is tax-free and you can spend it however you like.  Even if you have an outstanding mortgage, you can still take out equity release, as long as you pay off any debt secured against your property.  You can use some or all of the funds released to do this.          If you retire and find your home is worth more than your pension fund, equity release can helpTWO: It’s a simple process The most common way is to take out a lifetime mortgage which is a loan secured against your home, but unlike a traditional mortgage there are typically no monthly payments, allowing you to get on with enjoying your retirement.The loan plus roll-up interest is repaid when your equity release plan ends. This is normally when you or your surviving spouse pass away or go into long term care.As straightforward as it sounds, seeking the advice of a leading independent broker like Key Equity Release is crucial to help find a plan that meets your needs. They will also encourage you to involve your closest family so that everyone understands and is involved in the decision. They will explain how it will reduce the value of your estate and may affect your entitlement to means tested benefits – your expert equity release adviser will help you understand any implications specific to your inidual circumstances.            Organising equity release is a simple process, but talk it through with your grown up childrenTHREE: You will still own your homeWith a lifetime mortgage you always own your own home. Plans approved by the Equity Release Council, which Key recommends, offer a cast iron guarantee that you can stay in your home until the plan comes to an end and you can never owe more than your home is worth – so there’s no need to worry about house prices or how much interest builds up.          With a lifetime mortgage you will still own your home - all you\u0027ve done is take out a new loan on itFOUR: The amount you can raise will varyHow much cash you can release with an equity release plan will depend on things such as the value of your home, your age and health. At the time of writing an example from industry expert Key says a 65-year-old in good health could release up to 36 per cent of the value of his or her home. A healthy 80-year-old could release up to 52 per cent. In fact, last year Key enabled their customers to access an average of £86k of tax-free cash from their home. FIVE: You can use the money for anything you wantMany people use the money they release to clear outstanding credit card debts or interest only mortgages – but equally, lots of people use it for life\u0027s luxuries, such as holidays or new cars. A large percentage of people alternatively use it for home improvements, often \u0027future proofing\u0027 their family home with a new en-suite or a downstairs bathroom for the years ahead. Some use the money to help their children or grandchildren pay for homes or education. It\u0027s entirely up to you.Of course, it is always important to remember when releasing equity that you balance current needs with future wants and you should always think carefully before securing a loan against your home.       "},{"url":null,"title":"Seven metrics prove world better longer life poverty better health outcomes","story":"    The worldwide distribution of wealth has become more equitable since 1800, when much of the world lived on less than $2 a dayWhile income inequality in the U.S. continues to grow,  the worldwide distribution of wealth has become more equitable since 1800, when much of the world lived on less than $2 a day. Over the past 20 years, the proportion of people in the world who are living in extreme poverty has been cut in half.\u0027This is absolutely revolutionary,\u0027 Rosling writes in \u0027Factfulness.\u0027 \u0027I consider it to be the most important change that has happened in the world in my lifetime.\u0027 However, when Rosling and his team polled Americans, only 5 percent were able to correctly identify how the proportion of people living in poverty has changed in recent decades.Rosling maintained that it was just one of many widespread, negative misconceptions that we hold about the world – which Rosling called an \u0027overdramatic worldview.\u0027\u0027In fact, the vast majority of the world\u0027s population lives somewhere in the middle of the income scale,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027Perhaps they are not what we think of as middle class, but they are not living in extreme poverty. Their girls go to school, their children get vaccinated, they live in two-child families and they want to go abroad on holiday, not as refugees.\u0027 2. Life expectancy is higher across the globe than ever before Life expectancy across Europe during the Industrial Revolution hovered around 35 years – a number likely held down by high infant and child mortality rates, widespread disease in the pre-antibiotics era and  high rates of women dying in childbirth.Now life expectancy worldwide is nearly 72 years – an astounding achievement of modern medicine. In the Americas alone it  reached 76.9 by 2015.Rosling attributed the longer life expectancies to the fact that \u0027basic modernizations have reached most people and improved their lives drastically. They have plastic bags to store and transport food. They have plastic buckets to carry water and soap to kill germs.\u0027 3. Worldwide child mortality rates have dropped significantly Child mortality rates have also fallen steadily over the past century, reaching a low in 2015 of 4.5 percent of children around the globe dying before age 5. Compare that to 1950 when more than 22 percent of the world\u0027s children died before age 5. Even in the U.S. that number was 19.7 percent in 1950.Again, the contributions of modern medicine and improved public safety has helped eliminate many common causes of infant and child mortality.\u0027A lot of what went right was public health interventions,\u0027 Roser told DailyMail.com. \u0027The water supply today is much safer, has less pathogens that vulnerable children can succumb to and another big public health intervention is vaccinations. A lot of the diseases which previously killed millions of children were ones for which we developed vaccines.\u0027   \u0027It\u0027s also just an improvement in overall living conditions,\u0027 added Roser, whose work parallels Rosling\u0027s. \u0027The fact that people are much better nourished, that education has improved and people have a better understanding of how to ensure their children stay healthy, (and they have) better housing conditions.\u0027 4. Overpopulation is not going to be a problem anytime soon Those worried about overpopulation may be happy to learn that fertility rates are falling worldwide, down to an average of 2.49 children per woman in 2015 compared to of 5.5 children per woman in 1950. The U.S. alone is down from 3.58 children in 1958 to  1.91 children in 2011.\u0027We definitely know this population growth is coming to an end because the number of children born in the world is close to its peak already and the number of children born per women has halved,\u0027 Roser said.  Much of the decrease in fertility rates is linked to improving conditions for women around the world, he added. Across the tracks: Where a child lives in America - often...Share this articleAs women gain educations, footing in the workforce and access to birth control, they are able to  determine for themselves if \u0027they prefer that life to having seven children at home,\u0027 Roser said. The fertility numbers are also connected to the decrease in child morbidity - when fewer children are expected to die young, women don\u0027t need to have as many children to ensure that at least one child survives.  5. Global economies have been growing, driving up income levelsAt the same time, the Gross Domestic Product (the value of all goods and services produced in a country) in developed nations has been growing by roughly 2 percent a year for the past 150 years – causing income levels to approximately double every 36 years.The GDP ebbs and flows with the economy, taking dips during recessions and the Great Depression, but overall its growth rate has been a constant in the west.Ultimately the rise in incomes and in GDP per capita are like the metaphorical chicken and egg. While a rising GDP pushes up incomes, so too, do rising incomes drive GDP by providing more disposable income for citizens of a country to spend on its goods. Meanwhile, countries with lower incomes, such as China and India, have been growing at even faster rates during the past several decades and are beginning to catch up to Europe and America. In addition, Roser says the poorer, less-advanced countries have benefited from the technologies and innovations of the developed world - affecting everything from nutrition to vaccinations, or even large-scale manufacturing efficiencies. 6. Worldwide, fewer people live under authoritarian governments In other good news, more people around the world – some 55.8 percent – are living in Democracies than any other time in human history, Rosling noted. That\u0027s compared to 31.4 percent in 1950.As of 2015, just 23.23 percent of the world\u0027s population lived in an autocracy – a system of government in which one person holds absolute power – and 90 percent of them are in China. Compare that to 1980 when 43.6 percent of the world lived under an autocracy.Roser attributes this in part to the rapid information sharing now possible through the news and social media. As a society becomes more educated and has greater access to information about how its leaders are managing (or mismanaging) their country, citizens become empowered to push back against authoritarian leaders. In addition, the rapid pace of technological developments creates a more dynamic economy, making it harder for wealth to be limited to those who have inherited it. \u0027Once you have a much more agile transformed society where people do have the chance to rise from poor backgrounds to much more powerful backgrounds, they are much less likely to accept the status quo,\u0027 Roser said. 7. This is a time of relative peace, with fewer  international conflicts            This chart illustrates the worldwide decrease in international conflicts since 1500Finally, Rosling observes that international conflicts and wars are actually on the decline after centuries of unrest. Since roughly 1500, two or more of the world\u0027s most powerful countries have been at war more than half of the time.While conflicts in Syria and Yemen are currently creating massive humanitarian crises, it\u0027s notable that there has been no war in Western Europe for about three generations. \u0027Many people overestimate how many people are killed in conflict because there is a lot of  news coverage of these items,\u0027 Roser said. \u0027If you look at the number of people who are killed by terrorism for 2016, 0.06 percent of the people that died in 2016 died because of terrorist attacks,\u0027 Roser added. \u0027And if we include conflict, that\u0027s a fifth of a percent. So much, much less than a percent of the world is dying from this (type of) violence.\u0027 Ultimately, Rosling - and Roser - held that there is much to be hopeful about as we look to the future and learn from the past.\u0027We shouldn\u0027t diminish the tragedies of the droughts and famines happening right now,\u0027 Rosling wrote. \u0027But knowledge of the tragedies of the past should help everyone realize how the world has become both much more transparent and much better at getting help to where it\u0027s needed.\u0027 Our World in Data"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/16/13/190F5BF800000578-0-An_exterior_view_of_the_Pembroke_College_a_college_of_Oxford_Uni-a-19_1547645329048.jpg","title":"State school one Londons poorest areas sees 41 pupils offered places Oxford Cambridge","story":"    The students at Brampton Manor Academy in East Ham, Newham, to gain Oxbridge offers this yearThe academy\u0027s sixth form director Sam Dobin told the Evening Standard: \u0027We always thought it was possible because the students are stunningly able, but it\u0027s an amazing achievement for them.\u0027 Hopes are now high that most of the 41, who are mostly of ethnic minority backgrounds, will get the A-level grades to secure their place. There are about 600 pupils in the schools sixth form, with roughly 300 taking their A-Levels next year.           In 2014, one student received an offer to Oxbridge, it rose to 25 in 2018, of whom 20 began their studies in the autumn, and now 41 this year.

It is as far removed from the sort of tomato-growing operation most of us might have in our back gardens — except in one respect: the delicious smell of fresh tomatoes.These plants (all traditional varieties, nothing genetically modified) emerge from growbags filled with coir (recycled coconut husks) plus charcoal and friendly bacteria. Each bag has a couple of hydroponic straws feeding it a liquid diet of nutrient-rich rainwater captured from the roof, while violently pink LED lights make up for the lack of sunshine on a wet and freezing East Anglian afternoon.I arrive on the same morning as a fresh consignment of 15,000 baby vines from a Dutch propagation unit. They\u0027re laid out in just a few hours by a workforce of 27.Things move fast round here. Next month, the first batch of plants — which arrived just before Christmas — will already be producing their fruit, all premium plum and cherry tomatoes still on the vine and destined for British supermarkets.As operations director Richard Lewis points out, keeping harvested fruit on the vine retains freshness, as the last thing you want to do with a tomato is chill it.\u0027A tomato is like a Brie. Put it in the fridge and you loses all the flavour and texture,\u0027 he explains.          In the pink: Staff tend to the young plants at the East Anglia greenhouse At this time of year, the large majority of tomatoes in Britain have to be imported by refrigerated lorries from southern Europe. Even modern British glasshouses wind down production in the winter due to the lack of light. But this place will be generating home-grown tomatoes all year round.I am in phase one of the scheme which stretches across 14 acres — or 5.6 hectares as they say in a business that is firmly metric. This shiny new building will shortly be extended across another three hectares.Then, a similar glasshouse is due to go up in a neighbouring field. Eventually — after a total outlay of £30 million — the whole lot will cover 42 acres and employ 150 people.Even though I am looking at what will amount to a fraction of the final operation, it is still a mammoth project. This would make a perfectly respectable mid-size international airport.What hits you first is the sheer pinkness of it all. The plants need artificial light to produce all year round and white light generates too much heat, hence the choice of red and blue LED lights to bathe everything in pink.On walking through the airtight door, you sense a gentle breeze. All the plants sit on a raised metal platform beneath a tubular duct gently pumping extra air and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This raises the air pressure, which is another barrier to pesky insects (no pesticides are allowed in here) and makes it easier to control the heat.Tomatoes grow best at 23 degrees. In winter, heated water from the rainwater reservoir is circulated just like a central heating system.On a sunny day in midsummer, though, temperatures can get to a tropical 30 degrees-plus in a glasshouse. Most places can do little more than open the windows, which even then does little to reduce the heat.This one has an air-conditioning system which involves pouring recycled rainwater over huge panels of waxed cardboard next to the air-ducts, which blow the water particles around. Apparently, it can reduce the temperature by up to 15 degrees.Richard Lewis is one of Britain\u0027s best-known tomato growers, with 35 years experience in the business (he even has a cherry tomato named after him).His name will be on the packaging when this produce hits the shops, and he is bursting with enthusiasm as he shows me round, much like a child with a new train set.But then he does have a new train set. All the central heating pipes, 40 miles of them in parallel lines, double up as rail-tracks running along the floor. A fleet of electric carriages with cherry-picker platforms run along the tracks to help with maintenance and harvesting.

Each plant will have a life cycle of 13 months before being replaced.None of it would happen without a crucial part of the workforce — the bumble bees, 150 of which live in each of the 65 cardboard box hives scattered around the building.The bumble bees, used to pollinate the plants, are in their element, though they must be replaced every few months when the queen gets restless.As they can\u0027t get out through the anti-insect wall, the hives are relocated to a large wild-flower meadow which has been planted nearby. It\u0027s a sort of twilight home for elderly bees while buzzing boxes of new workers are brought in.The human workforce is interesting, too. Richard says his only job advertising was to put a sign on the gate and people came flocking. Just over half are from Eastern Europe but the rest are locals and there\u0027s an apprenticeship scheme in the pipeline.Crop manager Liam Walker, 26, who began his career picking strawberries in neighbouring Norfolk, says this plant is the envy of the East Anglian greenhouse community.And it hasn\u0027t been put together by some monster corporation. In fact, it is down to a very British consortium involving a couple of adventurous local farmers, a few experts like Richard Lewis and a lot of small investors.When high street banks declined to back the idea, the founders went to a fund management company, Amberside Capital, which raised the £15 million for the first phase from small investors. Some people now even have a tomato Inidual Savings Account (ISA).Now that it\u0027s up and running, however, the banks are queuing up to help with phase two.After all, whatever happens on the Brexit front, Britain\u0027s appetite for fresh, succulent tomatoes is never going to change one bit.Bloody Mary, anyone? "},{"url":null,"title":"Burglar caught leaving DNA ice cream tub","story":"Cooling off during last summer’s heatwave, Paul Hayman helped himself to a refreshing ice cream.

House prices are forecast to fall in all regions by Rics member estate agents, apart from the North West, where positive sentiment remains strongIf house prices do fall across all regions except for the North West, as forecast, then it will reverse the upward trend seen in some parts of the UK property market recently.While  Rics members reported falling prices in  markets in London, the South East and West, East Anglia and the North over the past three months, those in the North West, Midlands, Scotland and Northern Ireland said prices were on the rise.However, many said the future looked less bright for their local markets.Tim Hughes, of estate agents Bartlams, in Wolverhampton, said: The market appears to be slowing down in terms of the numbers of buyers coming forward and the number of potential vendors. We feel that we can only put this uncertainty down to Brexit.\u0027This echoed the views of London agents, who have already seen a marked slowdown triggered by Brexit and high prices. Jeremy Leaf, of Leaf \u0026amp Co, in north London, said: \u0027Political uncertainty, particularly Brexit, seems to be weighing heavily on our buyers at present resulting in price softening and lengthening transaction times. We remain in a price sensitive, needs driven market.\u0027            House prices have been suffering in London and the South East, with estate agents reporting falling sale prices, but the Midlands, Yorkshire \u0026amp Humber and North West have fared betterThe Rics report came as separate figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that house prices across Britain rose by just 2.8 per cent in the year to November, with the average property valued at £231,000.Simon Rubinsohn, Rics chief economist, said: ‘It is hardly a surprise, with ongoing uncertainty about the path to Brexit dominating the news agenda, that even allowing for the normal patterns around the Christmas holidays, buyer interest in purchasing property in December was subdued.‘This is also very clearly reflected in a worsening trend in near-term sales expectations.’ Last month the Bank of England warned that demand was falling and the supply of new homes was also low.          Surveyors across the country expect the slump to continue as buyers are put off by Brexit uncertainty, research by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) has found.

In London, the number fell 22 per cent to 6,438.The capital – for decades a centre of red-hot growth – was the only region to experience an outright fall in property prices in the year to November, with a 0.7 per cent drop to an average £473,000.The West Midlands was the fastest-growing region for prices, with the average property’s value up 4.6 per cent at £197,000. East Midlands homes were the next best performers, with growth of 4.4 per cent and an average value of £192,000.In England the average value rose by 2.6 per cent to £247,000.Wales saw growth of 5.5 per cent to £161,000 Scottish prices rose 2.9 per cent to £151,000 and Northern Ireland prices were up 4.8 per cent at £135,000.Kevin Roberts, of Legal \u0026amp General Mortgage Club, said some buyers and sellers were taking a ‘wait-and-see approach when it comes to the property market’."},{"url":null,"title":"City giants demand second Brexit referendum","story":"    Philip Hammond (pictured) told business leaders the \u0027threat\u0027 of a No-Deal Brexit could be taken \u0027off the table\u0027, it emerged last night\u0027We have to reach out to MPs in the Commons first,\u0027 he said. \u0027There is a large majority in the Commons that is opposed to No Deal.\u0027Last night a source close to Mr Hammond said: \u0027He is comprehensively opposed to No Deal.

Air freight through Hong Kong International Airport (pictured above) was down 1.6 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarterAir freight volumes in Hong Kong were down by a massive 5 percent in December compared with the same month a year earlier, according to the Civil Aviation Department.Most economists have forecast a period of slower growth in 2019 but policymakers have expressed hope for a soft landing rather than an outright recession.Policymakers almost always aim for a soft landing, in an effort to maintain business and consumer confidence, but there are good reasons to be sceptical about the scenario.Experience shows the economy is characterised by a significant number of positive feedback mechanisms which amplify booms and slumps.Expansions tend to accelerate as business investment, employment, incomes, consumer spending and equity prices reinforce each other.Once the economy starts to lose momentum, however, all these factors tend to interact with each other in the opposite direction to intensify the slowdown.A soft landing is still possible but a hard landing is more likely unless something happens to kickstart global growth."},{"url":null,"title":"Footage shows Irish farmer new born calf bundled FORD FOCUS","story":"    Johnny Courtney rushed Bouncer to the vet and videoed himself with him on the journey back The hilarious footage was captured in June, 2017 in Killarney, County Kerry, Ireland but has started circulating widely online recently. It shows the young farmer taking a selfie video to the tune of Mr. Blue Sky by Electric Light Orchestra as the cow looks on.  It was shared this month by a Facebook user called Brendan Fleming, with the caption: \u0027No trailer licence!!

Calling it a flexitarian or \u0027flexi\u0027 burger is daft. It\u0027s just trying to tap into a trend.          Ms Paterson contacted Aldi on Facebook after seeing the burgers for sale.

This meant the children went to school even less. So hostels were opened, where children could stay during term time and have a full-time education.

and indicated that Labour will table more votes of no confidence in the Government as he doges making a choice on a second public vote.Although he repeated Labour party policy that \u0027all options\u0027 are on the table. On holding more no confidence votes, he said: \u0027We will come back on it again if necessary because we are determined...to give people the choice about who their MP should be.\u0027In the meantime all options are on the table, we are serious about finding a way through.           Theresa May (pictured in Downing Street last night) has offered to hold Brexit talks with the Labour leader - but he has sparked fury by snubbing her offer\u0027If the government remains intransigent...and the country is facing the potential disaster of no deal then our duty will be to look at the options set out in our conference motion - including that of a public vote.\u0027Mr Corbyn has faced a storm of criticism from MPs - including Labour backbenchers - for refusing the PM\u0027s offer of talks.And this morning Tony Blair also attacked his decision, saying it is wrong to make the snub at a \u0027moment of national crisis\u0027. The Labour former PM accused Mr Corbyn of deliberately avoiding engagement on Brexit.  \u0027If, in a moment of national crisis, the Prime Minister asks the Leader of the Opposition to come and talk, of course he should,\u0027 he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.  He added: \u0027At some point he is going to have to make his position clear,\u0027 he said. \u0027It is quite hard to read the runes sometimes in Labour policy right now, but, as I understand, our position is that if the no confidence motion fails, as it has, then there is an overwhelming majority for supporting putting this back to the people.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Chelsea England star Ruben Loftus Cheek 22 denies gay","story":"Chelsea and England footballer Ruben Loftus-Cheek, pictured, has denied online rumours that he had come out as gay to his fellow Chelsea team mates  The star, who is currently injured, wrote that he would fully support any player who came out          Loftus-Cheek wrote on Twitter that any player who wanted to come out would have his full support but said the rumour about his private life was untrueNo current premier league footballer has ever announced they were gay while playing in England. Former Aston Villa player Thomas Hitzlsperger announced he was gay after retiring from the sport in 2013 due to injury.  A Chelsea fan was recently fined almost £1,000 and banned from all football stadiums until 2022 after he admitted hurling homophobic abuse at Brighton and Hove Albion players on December 16 at the Amex Stadium in Brighton.  Japanese firm Hitachi scraps plans for its new £20billion...UK motorists will need a \u0027Green Card\u0027 to drive in Europe if...Share this articleGeorge Bradley was thrown out of the ground by stewards and police after he was heard furiously yelling foul abuse at players while his team played away at Brighton and Hove Albion on December 16.The 20-year-old was heard in the \u0027away\u0027 seating section and later arrested.

It’s a nostalgic image, with a touch of magic from those disembodied feet and hands’I took the picture in the summer of 2013, in a rural part of northern Austria. I grew up in Holland. I went back there in 2012 to try to recapture my own childhood, but the farm where I was born no longer existed and the people I knew as a child no longer lived there. And then I found my childhood – or what I wished it had been – here, in the Austrian countryside.I was asked to do a documentary project about the Waldviertel region, which is how I came to meet these two local little girls, Hannah and Alena. Their mother, Sonja, asked if I would take some pictures of them.That summer, I travelled to their grandmother’s farm in a village called Waldberg, between Vienna and the Czech Republic. It’s where they always spend their holidays. We became friends and I’ve been going back ever since to photograph them.The two boys – Martin, who is on the swing with the girls, and his brother Christian, whose hands and feet peek out from behind them – are their friends who spend their summers at the farm, too. When I first met Christian, all he wanted to talk about was my camera. But, from the outset, the girls simply did their own thing. I would start our sessions with a few posted portraits, but soon they would get bored and ignore me. And that’s when I would begin to work.I think I was lying on the ground to get this shot, with my 35mm. It’s a camera I love because it allows me to be right inside the image, and I want my viewers to feel the same thing.I don’t know if I purposefully avoided showing their full faces. It wasn’t to anonymise them. Rather, it was to capture something more universal. Instead of looking into their eyes, you follow their inidual gazes, and you see the social dynamics at play between them. But I’m not really interested in what they’re playing with. Here, I hate those metal pipes, they spoil my picture. And without the children, there is no picture.Alena, the older girl, is at the centre of the image, and that’s true in how they play together. It’s a role that naturally falls to her – she is in charge, she decides what they’re going to do, and where they’re going to play. The others are happy to follow her lead. And while any other adult – a parent or a grandparent – might be tempted to intervene (“Don’t do that” or “That’s too rough”), I don’t judge, I don’t comment, or direct anything. I might be present, but the kids are on their own. Wherever they go, I go. They don’t see me. They’re in their own world.It’s a nostalgic image, with a touch of magic from those disembodied feet and hands of Christian’s. The longer I live, the more I long to be a child again. This project has perhaps been more about looking not for my actual childhood, but one I might have had.When I was two, my father and older sister Anita were in a car accident. Anita was killed, and my father was left with the mental age of a child of seven. So the only father I knew, growing up, was someone who was aggressive, and of whom I was ashamed. He wasn’t a normal father. Perhaps this is why I look for the idyllic, or the romantic in the stories I shoot – to balance things out, as a coping mechanism. I think that the most important things that happen to you, in life, happen between the ages of two and 12.When I see these four children here, in their own world, what I love is that they’re in charge. They are powerful. And that’s how I choose not only to depict children in my work, but also how I want to relate to them in everyday life: as human beings, as equals. Respected, empowered, not patronised. They inspire me.• Carla Kogelman’s I Am Waldviertel is at Schilt Gallery, Amsterdam, until 9 March.

His private papers tell a different storyThe historian Eric Hobsbawm, who was born in 1917, the year of the Russian Revolution, and died in 2012 at the age of 95, was widely regarded as an unrepentant Stalinist, a man who, unlike other Marxist historians such as EP Thompson and Christopher Hill, never resigned his membership of the Communist party, and never expressed any regret for his commitment to the communist cause.In the later part of his long life he was most probably the world’s best-known historian, his books translated into more than 50 languages and selling millions of copies across the globe (about a million in Brazil alone, for example). Yet when the BBC invited him on to the radio programme Desert Island Discs in 1995, the presenter Sue Lawley addressed him distantly as “Professor Hobsbawm”, left his books more or less unmentioned, and focused her attention so unremittingly on his lifelong commitment to communism that the programme turned from the usual comfortable chat into a hostile interrogation.Many of the reviews of his bestselling history of the 20th century, The Age of Extremes, a work translated into 30 languages, charged him with playing down the evils of Stalinism, and the influential anti-communist French historians Pierre Nora and François Furet were so successful in preventing its publication in France that it was eventually translated into French by an obscure publishing house based in Belgium.The label “Stalinist” dogged Hobsbawm throughout his adult life and affected his career in numerous ways. Even before the cold war had properly started, it prevented him from getting a job with the BBC. In 1945, he applied for a full-time post making educational broadcasts to help servicemen adjust to civilian life after a long period in the forces. The BBC found him “a most suitable candidate”, but the appointment was swiftly vetoed by MI5. Hobsbawm was, it warned, “not likely to lose any opportunity he may get to disseminate propaganda and obtain recruits for the Communist party”. By 1947 he had managed to secure employment as a lecturer in history at Birkbeck College, London, then something of a haven for leftwingers whose academic careers had got into difficulties because of their political views. Although he had produced some specialised academic articles, his other publication plans had been frustrated by the same kind of suspicion that had blocked his career in the BBC. In 1955 his book The Rise of the Wage-Worker was rejected on the recommendation of two anonymous academic reviewers who found it lacking in objectivity because it was Marxist. The book remains unpublished to this day.Despite his growing reputation as an economic historian, Hobsbawm was for a long time unable to obtain promotion at Birkbeck. His applications for academic positions in economic history at Oxford and Cambridge were turned down on political grounds. In 1972, his problems with the BBC resurfaced after his broadcast on why America was losing the Vietnam war, delivered as part of a series called A Personal View, ran into trouble because of its support for the Vietnamese cause. The Americans pressured the BBC into commissioning a rebuttal by a former British intelligence officer, who argued somewhat implausibly that America was not losing the war at all. Of course, hostility to communism was, as Hobsbawm himself pointed out, much milder in Britain than it was in, say, the US. Still, it had a clearly discernible effect on his career.Was Hobsbawm really the dangerous communist, the Stalinist apologist, the unrepentantly hardline Marxist that so many have assumed him to be? A careful reading of his autobiography, Interesting Times, published in 2002, as well of his other published work, will do a lot to dispel this simplistic view. But it is in the vast mass of private papers, including diaries, letters and unpublished personal reminiscences that the real answers are to be found. They can be supplemented by other sources, including the many files MI5 kept on him for several decades. What is the story this material tells?Some of the prejudice against Hobsbawm was clearly based on a feeling that he was somehow not quite British (in contrast to real enemies of the country such as the Cambridge spies, who were graduates of public schools and therefore above suspicion). Born in Alexandria, he had spent his childhood in Vienna. This aroused suspicion in establishment circles. He was also Jewish by origin, a further black mark against his reputation (one Special Branch report described his uncle Harry, with whom he lived for a time in his teens, as “a sneering, critical type of person, harsh of speech, half Jew in appearance, having a long nose, thinning hair and blue eyes”). It was, and still is, widely thought that Hobsbawm was a refugee who fled with his family from Germany to England in 1933 in order to escape Hitler. In fact his father was British, and so he was a British citizen by birth. His mother, a passionate anglophile and professional translator, insisted on English being spoken at their home in Vienna. He was known by his fellow pupils at school as “the English boy”. There is no doubt, however, about his early commitment to the communist cause. In 1931, when he was sent to live in Berlin with an uncle and aunt following the premature death of his parents (his father from a heart attack, his mother from tuberculosis), he encountered an overheated political atmosphere that presented the young with a stark choice between communism and nazism. As an English boy from a liberal Jewish family, Hobsbawm had no option but to commit himself to communism.But there were other, more personal reasons for his choice, reasons that help explain why he never abandoned the communist ideals he acquired in Berlin. The genteel poverty in which he had grown up in Vienna, and the miserable financial position of his uncle in Berlin, who had lost his job in the Depression as a result of laws restricting the numbers of foreign employees in German businesses, contrasted sharply with the relative prosperity of his fellow pupils at his high school. He felt ashamed of his shabby appearance and the straitened circumstances in which he lived. “Only by turning this completely around,” he confessed to his diary, “and becoming proud of it did I conquer the shame.” The real attraction of the communists was that they turned poverty into a virtue.In these, his teenage years, following the death of his parents, Hobsbawm was engaged in a desperate search for a sense of family and belonging that was only partially satisfied by living with his uncle and aunt. For a short while he found it in the unlikely form of the Scouts, but it was the communist movement that really met all these deep emotional needs. He read a few basic Marxist texts, involved himself in the activities of the Socialist School Students’ League, and took part in the last great Communist party demonstration in Berlin, on 25 January 1933. A few days later, Hitler was appointed chancellor. Life became increasingly dangerous for communists and Jews. But it was for economic rather than political reasons that Hobsbawm’s uncle Sidney decided to move the family to Britain, after the failure of yet another business venture, this time in Barcelona. So many of Hobsbawm’s relatives were failed businessmen that it is hardly surprising he saw little future in capitalism.The German Communist party had continued to grow even while, towards the end of 1932, the Nazis were starting to lose support. Here was a movement that had 100 representatives in the national legislature. When Hobsbawm encountered the Communist party of Great Britain, the contrast could not have been greater. With not a single MP in Westminster until 1935, and a membership that made it little more than a sect, it did not impress Hobsbawm in the least. What’s more, it was an aggressively working-class organisation that had no time for intellectuals. Writing his diaries at home, in German, every day, Hobsbawm concluded it was not for him. He had already decided quite self-consciously that, as he put it, “I am an intellectual through and through.” He was beginning to realise that he was unusually clever, but he was already haunted by the feeling that he was physically unattractive. His cousin Denis said to him brutally he was “ugly as sin, but you have a mind”. Hobsbawm began reading voraciously, week by week, all the major Marxist texts. “Drown yourself in Leninism,” was his note to himself. “Let it become your second nature.” After reading 12 pages of Lenin he noted in his diary: “Astonishing how that cheers me up and clears my mind. I was in a total good mood afterwards.” This is not the feeling that most people have after ploughing through works such as Materialism and Empirio-Criticism. As for Stalin, Hobsbawm barely mentioned him at all.He was also a political realist. The only mass movement of the left in Britain in the 1930s was the Labour party, and so Hobsbawm shunned the Communists and volunteered to help Labour in the local elections of 1934 (as he did in the general election of 1945). And he was far from narrow in his interests, visiting the major London galleries and museums, and reading numerous works (in English, French and German) of fiction, poetry and drama, as well as developing an enthusiasm for jazz, at a time when it was anathematised by the official cultural policy of the Communist party.This breadth of pursuits only increased after he became an undergraduate at King’s College, Cambridge, in 1936. It was at this point, finding a growing number of students committing themselves to communism as a result of the Labour party’s failure to support the republic in the Spanish civil war, that he finally joined the Communist party, in the form of the university’s Socialist Club. But he quickly became bored with the club’s political dogmatism. He found its activities and especially its regular Bulletin, which he was charged with editing, “barren”, so he abandoned it for the non-political student periodical the Granta, duly becoming its editor, too. Here he had the scope for writing about cinema, a particular passion, but also producing profiles of leading Cambridge characters and visiting politicians.After the war, he continued as a member of the party and did some work in supporting sister parties in central Europe, at least until they began to fall victim to a ruthless process of Stalinisation at the end of the 1940s. But in truth, Hobsbawm never behaved as a Communist was supposed to. He was not an activist, he did not sell Communist party literature on the street corner and he wrote regularly for non-Communist (“bourgeois”) publications, earning the party’s disapproval. He confessed himself an “outsider in the movement”. His main focus was on the work of the Communist Party Historians’ Group (CPHG), a relatively short-lived organisation of the late 1940s and early 50s largely confined to “theoretical discussions”. MI5 operatives, monitoring bugged conversations at Communist party HQ in London, noted that despite its attempts to make him behave like a loyal member, one senior official complained that “he had just ceased to answer any letters!”What Hobsbawm was committed to was an ideal of communism with a small “C”, an ideal he had imbibed as an adolescent more through reading the Marxist classics than through taking an active part in the real politics of the movement. He also remained convinced, as he had been in the 1930s, that Communists would have to cooperate with other leftist parties in the struggle for power: hence his enthusiasm for the French Popular Front, which established a socialist and liberal government in 1936 with the support of the Communist party.In the 50s, however, the chances of collaborating were minimal. The British Communist party was obdurately Stalinist, and without mass support. As time went on, Hobsbawm’s disillusion with it steadily grew. How could he, for example, possibly support Stalin’s policies when these involved show trials of “cosmopolitans”, or in other words, Jewish members, in Czechoslovakia and other communist-dominated countries in eastern Europe? After all, he knew a good number of them, and was aware that they were innocent of the charges brought against them.Not long after the death of Stalin in 1953 the international communist movement was plunged into a deep crisis. On 25 February 1956, at the 20th congress of the Communist party of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin for the “cult of personality” that had grown up around him, and for the numberless murders and atrocities he had committed. As the contents of the speech found their way to the west, the British party leadership tried to ignore them. But in April 1956 the historians’ group, led by Hobsbawm, Thompson and Hill, issued a stinging rebuke to the party for its failure to express regret for its “past uncritical endorsement of all Soviet polities and views”. An impassioned debate broke out in the party periodical World News, with Hobsbawm in particular calling for an open confrontation with the party’s past, its errors and its lies. He demanded that it had to be open to democratic change from below simply imposing a “party line” from above was unacceptable. He met with delaying tactics and obfuscation from the leadership.The crisis deepened in October 1956 when a liberal communist government came to power in Hungary on the back of mass popular demonstrations after months of stonewalling by the Stalinist regime in Budapest. On 4 November, Moscow responded with a military invasion, suppressing the new regime and killing at least 2,500 Hungarians who had tried to resist. These events, Hobsbawm declared, shocked party intellectuals and “pierced the core of their faith and hope”. Attempting to avoid an open confrontation with the leadership in London, which had backed the invasion, he conceded that the invasion was “a tragic necessity” in view of the threat of a reactionary rightwing government taking over, but demanded that “the USSR should withdraw its troops as soon as this is possible”.A furious debate broke out within the party as the leadership refused to budge. “Hobsbawm,” a phone conversation monitored by MI5 recorded one member as saying, “wants to call for the overthrow of the leadership and a new policy”. His attitude towards the party leaders was described as “bellicose”. As leading historians such as Thompson resigned from the CPGB in despair, Hobsbawm demanded the right to form an inner-party opposition. One leading figure in the party called him “a dangerous character”. He and the other historians, said another, were “a clueless lot of scruffs, potentially quite dangerous”. The “freedoms” they demanded would lead to “party anarchy”. Hobsbawm responded by attacking the CPGB’s “monumental complacency”. The party refused to budge. He and the other historians were “backboneless and spineless intellectuals”. Hill and most of the others resigned, having achieved nothing.Hobsbawm went with them in many respects, contributing to their periodical the New Reasoner and joining with them in the New Left Club, outside the party. George Matthews, editor of the party paper, the Daily Worker, declared that “it would, in his opinion, be a good thing” if they “provoked Hobsbawm to leave the party”. He was in any case “an outsider”. Hobsbawm was summoned to party headquarters and told that “they wanted him to remain in the party and not do things that might put him out of it. Hobsbawm,” reported the MI5 monitor, “had been frightfully upset, swearing that he never wanted to leave.”The exchange was a revealing one. Once again, Hobsbawm’s deep emotional commitment to the ideals of communism, symbolised for him by his continued membership of the party, had come to the fore. While most intellectuals in the party had become communists as part of the struggle against fascism in the 1930s, and so, once the struggle had been won, did not find it difficult to leave, Hobsbawm’s commitment went much deeper. Yet the obdurate Stalinism of the British party now left him out in the cold.After the mid-50s, he gravitated towards the very different model being forged by the reform-oriented “Eurocommunist” parties of Spain and Italy. By the 80s, following the ideas of Antonio Gramsci, he came to believe that the British Labour party had to reach out for an alliance with elements in the middle classes, since the old working class on which it had for so long relied for its support was now in decline otherwise democracy in Britain was doomed. Far from being a Stalinist, he had now become the prophet of New Labour. His ideas were taken up by Neil Kinnock when he became leader of the Labour party, and put into action by Tony Blair, though he later came to regret Blair’s failure to unravel the neoliberal policies implemented by the Conservatives in the 80s (“Thatcher in trousers” was his verdict on Blair).How did all this affect his practice as a historian? Is there any connection between Hobsbawm’s communism and the global fame and success of his historical writings?The first and perhaps the most important thing to note is that his historical work was never purely Marxist. Far from being a “central European intellectual”, as some have claimed, he was influenced above all by French intellectual ideas, particularly those of the group of historians associated with the periodical Annales. Hobsbawm’s mentor at Cambridge in the late 1930s and afterwards, the economic historian Mounia Postan, introduced him to the work of the Annales, inviting their leading figure Marc Bloch to Cambridge and sharing in many respects their belief in history as an all-encompassing discipline, dealing analytically not only with politics, economy and society but also with the arts and indeed all aspects of life in the past.Hobsbawm deepened this acquaintance with the French historical school in the 1950s, when he spent long periods in Paris mixing with dissident leftwing intellectuals. His book, The Age of Revolution, published in 1962, clearly showed the influence of the Annales, as did its successors The Age of Capital and The Age of Empire. What gave his writing a particularly wide appeal was nevertheless its indebtedness to Marxist models of interpretation, deployed with clarity and power and illustrated with examples and evidence taken from an astonishingly wide range of sources in a variety of languages. Here, his deep reading of European literature, beginning in his teenage years, displayed its influence in a style that combined elegance and wit, engaging the reader in a way that no conventional Marxist exposition could ever manage to do.At the same time, like the other English Marxist historians such as Thompson, Hobsbawm was intellectually liberated by his distancing from the British Communist party in 1956. From writing in the 1940s and early 1950s about the rise of the working class, he turned to studying marginal and deviant people in history, “primitive rebels”, millenarians, Luddites, bandits, seemingly irrational popular movements that in fact expressed a strong degree of rationality in their rebellion against the encroachments of capitalism on their way of life. Of course, he slotted them into a basically Marxist teleology (they were “primitive” rebels after all, unlike the supposedly sophisticated modern rebels of Marxist labour movements). Still, the sympathy with which he treated them was obvious to everyone who was able to read between the lines.Marxist ideas gave his work a coherence and structure that merely empirical history was unable to achieve they helped him to develop concepts that made sense of the inchoate material of history, and at the same time, because they were novel and controversial, provided topics for debates and discussions that are still going on among historians today – “the general crisis of the 17th century”, “the declining standard of living in the industrial revolution”, “social banditry”, “the invention of tradition”, “the long 19th century” and many more. At the same time, concepts and ideas never forced the basic evidence on to the sidelines. Where fact and interpretation clashed, Hobsbawm was almost always scrupulous enough to yield to fact, as, for example, in his abandonment of Marxist theories of imperialism in his book The Age of Empire. Neither as a communist intellectual nor as a practising historian was he ever a mere propagandist.As for his confrontation with the communist past in the final two decades of his life, following the fall of the Berlin Wall, there is no sign that he concealed or passed over the many crimes and atrocities that had disfigured it. The shrill demands to repent and recant with which he was so frequently confronted deserve to be treated with contempt. Rather, what gives The Age of Extremes much of its fascination is the spectacle of a lifelong communist trying, often but not always successfully, to come to terms with the failure of the cause he had served for so long as an intellectual.• Eric Hobsbawm: A Life in History by Richard J Evans is published by Little, Brown on 7 February (RRP £30).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.granitadicaffe has just “entered the gates of Purgatory” with Dante:In Il Purgatorio it takes 9 cantos before you reach Purgatory itself. On the way they meet and chat to various historical personages. The gates are a little hard to find and when you get there there are 3 large steps of marble outside: the first is white, smooth and polished, the second dark rough and cracked, and the third red like blood spurting from a vein. On these stands a big angel with a sword, who only opened the door after Virgil explained their mission. He used 2 keys, a silver and a gold one. If the latter, which is difficult to turn, won’t open then you can’t get in. It is hard to enter Purgatory but once you are inside you mustn’t look back!“I’m not a slow reader,” says kinson1964, but “I’ve been reading the same book since last year.” That book is Jerusalem by Alan Moore:A huge book (page numbers reach four figures) and it’s an amazing read. It deals with Northampton rather like Joyce deals with Dublin or Gray does with Glasgow - all human life (and death) is there together with a wealth of historical facts, trivia and metaphysical speculation. I now wish that I knew the town well for the extra psycho-geographical resonance.A Delicate Truth, “another le Carré novel leaving barbs deep in the body politic of the high and mighty of Britain”, has captivated notatalllover:Unputdownable, Toby Bell, the hero, showing the meaning of bouncebackability, having grabbed hold of the hand of someone under the cosh of the secret state faces brutal consequences in his desire to find the truth behind the lies and cover up hidden under the pacific blanket wielded by the Foreign Office. Again le Carré lets his readers know Britain is a police state in all but name. A rewarding read.A quick tip from Dennis89:Just finished Night Flight by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. A short novella and the ideal read for one sitting.... Beautiful prose and quite atmospheric for such a short book.And a fine idea from nkenny:I’ve been listening to the audiobook of Boswell’s Life of Samuel Johnson. It’s extremely funny and perfect for dipping in and out of during spare moments.Van Gogh’s letters have impressed marosc:They’re really good. The main element of his personality that’s coming out is commitment to authenticity - he’s determined to be himself even in the face of severe family pressure to conform and to be true to his artistic vision even when it means only selling a handful of pieces because he refuses to compromise to make his art more saleable. And his brother Theo must be the greatest art benefactor in history - pretty much single handedly supporting Vincent so he can dedicate himself to art - and what a legacy we’ve got because of that. The way Vincent writes about his art and comparing it with other artists (it’s not true that he was a loner - he was friends with Toulouse-Lautrec \u0026amp Seurat and, of course, began a failed attempt at an artists’ community with Gauguin) is totally engaging - you can really feel his excitement about what he’s doing.Emily Wilson’s translation of Homer’s Odyssey is, according to FrogC, “excellent”:It was not at all what I expected. The voyaging adventures are mostly told in flashback and take up a smaller part of the book than Odysseus’s return home and revenge upon the suitors who’ve been pestering his wife and eating him out of house and home. (I kept thinking, impertinently, that that was not how I would have written it.) And it’s a surprisingly cruel book - I ended up not liking Odysseus very much.Finally, Tom Mooney recommends A Different Drummer by William Melvin Kelley:In 1957, a young black farmer shoots his livestock, salts his fields and burns down his house. He then walks away from his fictional southern state. Every other black citizen follows his lead.From this brilliant set-up, Kelley tells the story of young Tucker Caliban, his ancestors and their masters, owners and bosses, entirely through the eyes of the white people left behind in town.There are a lot of moving parts in this novel but they tie together beautifully come the end. It’s at times hopeful and cynical, moral and immoral, simple and complex. Almost 60 years after it was first published it feels incredibly fresh and would sit happily alongside the works of Ellison, Baldwin and other great writers on civil rights in the US.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

While urging RPI to be fixed, it said the government should only use CPI until the error was removed.The government is gradually moving away from using RPI to CPI, with further plans to use another measurement of inflation known as CPIH, which also includes housing costs as well as the usual price changes measured by CPI.“Winners and losers” have however been created by the use of RPI instead of CPI in the meantime, according to the committee’s report. Investors in RPI-linked government bonds have been receiving about £1bn more in interest payments each year, even though others have lost out.A spokesperson for the Office for National Statistics, which publishes inflation data on a monthly basis, said: “We agree the RPI has significant shortcomings. We will therefore continue to work closely with our counterparts in government and at the Bank of England and respond to the committee.”A Treasury spokesperson also said RPI was flawed and added it was moving away from using it.“Given the extensive use of RPI across the public and private sectors, further moves away from the measure are complex and potentially costly. As set out at budget, the government’s objective is that CPIH will become its headline measure over time and that it will reduce the use of RPI when and where practicable,” the spokesperson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cb0cb58b0493aaf2114489d4b4976707e17fd96/0_613_3578_2146/master/3578.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=800821f4c470811777c23d03488c5edc","title":"native american routes the ancient trails hidden in chicagos grid system","story":"Many of the city’s roads began as indigenous pathways – just one example of Native American infrastructure that helped make Chicago a successful cityAt 65, Chicago’s American Indian Center is the oldest urban indigenous center in the US. Its current retrospective highlights its importance to the city and is intended to serve as “evidence of the Native experience, existence, and survival.” But there is an easier way to see the enduring indigenous influence on Chicago – simply walk a few blocks east to Clark Street.Named for George Rogers Clark, whose brother William was one half of the Lewis and Clark expedition, Clark Street was formed during the tail end of the ice age and has been a key trail for thousands of years. Its irregularity is an unnoticed but integral reminder of the many tribes that once called the area home, and a fitting example of the erasure of the Native influence on the city’s development.Over the course of four distinct periods of glacial melting, stretching as far back as 14,500 years ago, Chicago’s terrain was shaped by the ebbs and flows of melting ice. Through the process of littoral drift, where small bits of sand and organic matter drifted from place to place on the tide, small but distinct ridges were etched into the land. Those natural high grounds, rising no more than 10 or 15 feet above the rest of the terrain, became some of the pathways used by Native peoples as they began to inhabit the area about 11,000 years ago.These high points held obvious value: most of the land was swampy, and very little stayed dry year-round. Indigenous tribes passed down their understanding of the land’s natural features through oral traditions. Incoming European settlers, including French trappers traveling to the area during the 17th and 18th centuries, depended on this knowledge for survival. They also quickly came to understand the significance of the trails, adapting them for commercial and military purposes.However, that knowledge was rarely codified in printed form, and it was not until the early 20th century that the remaining Native camps and trails were comprehensively mapped by the surveyor Albert Scharf. His rendition remains the definitive representation of Native impact on the area, as any remaining sites were quickly wiped out in the development-heavy years that followed.The indigenous footpaths, for centuries not much wider than five or six feet across, were some of the first roads in Chicago to be widened and normalized.While the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 incorporated today’s midwestern states as a new territory and established the principle of iding the land into regular, square areas, Chicago’s modern grid system remained a fantasy for decades. Though a vision of regular six-mile square plots was enshrined in the Land Ordinance of 1785, the city’s first plat map wasn’t made until 1830, and only covered what is now downtown Chicago.“The whole idea of imposing a grid on this land is from one point of view kind of laughable,” said Henry Binford, a professor of urban history at Northwestern University. “The indigenous trail network made a lot more sense, at least in the beginning.”But mapping fever had important consequences for the city – in effect, the maps sold east coast investors on a process of land speculation that would, in time, create the city we know today. The grid was designed with this outcome in mind, making it easy for speculators to ide the city into identical, saleable plots that would also serve to speed up commerce by placing major roads every half-mile. Capitalism and Native removal worked hand in hand, and the grid slowly came into focus as settlers began to drain the swampy land for redevelopment.“The grid was always aspirational,” said Sam Kling, a research associate at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs whose PhD dissertation explored Chicago’s transportation infrastructure. “It was drawn on a map before it was actually built, and it was the blueprint for Chicago’s growth, even before the city reached anywhere near the extent to which the grid was supposed to extend.”While these plans held a prefigurative vision of a city on the make, they could not have existed without the legwork carried out by generations of Native Americans. The roads were only one small piece of indigenous infrastructure that proved essential to Chicago’s success as a midwestern metropolis in the 19th century: a number of tribes including the Illini, the Fox and the Potawatomi peoples used the Chicago area as a meeting site for generations, thanks to the near-confluence of several rivers in the area.Tribes carried boats from the Mississippi River to the Chicago and Des Plaines rivers by traversing the Chicago Portage, located in what is now the South Lawndale neighborhood, which connected Chicago to the western United States.The indigenous scholar and Potawatomi tribe member John Low, a professor at the Ohio State University – Newark, notes that Native people taught incoming white settlers these transportation routes, as well as giving them snowshoes, canoes and other transportation tools – necessary equipment as white colonizers spread further west.“Native people gave European settlers the ways and means of transportation,” Low says. “We haven’t gotten much in exchange.”Just as Clark Street betrays Chicago’s Native American roots by honoring those who saw to their removal, Rogers Avenue erases one of the few obvious markers of how Native removal was essential to the creation of Chicago. For years it was known as Indian Boundary Line Road, referencing the 1816 Treaty of St Louis that pushed indigenous people further out of Chicago. Only 17 years later, just a month after Chicago was formally incorporated as a town, the 1833 Treaty of Chicago revoked all indigenous claims to the area, allowing for the genocide of Native Americans to continue pushing westward.In 1909 Indian Boundary Line Road was renamed after Phillip Rogers, an early white settler who had already given his name to the surrounding neighborhood of Rogers Park. The decision to hide the street’s importance contributes to the ongoing erasure of Native influence on modern Chicago.The erasure of Indian Boundary Line Road, mitigated somewhat by a remaining nearby park with a similar name, as well as Pottawatomie Park, has historical implications for how Chicagoans today understand the legacy of Native removal. Other local street names such as Wabansia and Menomonee make direct reference to Native Americans who lived in the area centuries ago, but Low believes they don’t help people recognize the eradication of Native life that made Chicago possible.“We have to remember that the urban landscape often almost completely overwrote indigenous territories in places like Seattle and Chicago,” agrees Coll Thrush, a professor at the University of British Columbia.“Even when the urban geography has some of its roots in indigenous realities, we have to do the difficult work of reimagining those spaces as indigenous, by paying attention to the historical archive and by listening to descendant indigenous communities.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b74511d1b623a2d8559136e4dd172c0e37c9114/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9a5f96557e50cee7a7bfdebf69e62aa","title":"which is the worlds most vegan city","story":"Portland has a vegan strip club, Palitana is a meat-free zone and Bristol makes the most vegan-related Google searches, but what makes a city vegan-friendly?Since Greggs announced a new vegan alternative to its meaty sausage roll at the start of the year, the Quorn pastries have “flown off the shelves”, the bakery chain says, selling hundreds of thousands in the first week alone.Its success is a testament to both a remarkable PR stunt and the seemingly unstoppable rise of veganism, which, according to a new study, has been led by Bristol.According to Google Trends, the interest level around the world for all things vegan – restaurants, recipes, dog food – was highest in Bristol, followed by Portland, Edinburgh, Vancouver and Seattle. Six of the top 20 cities were in the US, with European and Australian cities also showing a strong interest in going meat-free.Google searches won’t give you an accurate idea of how many people commit to vegan diets or buy vegan products, but Chef’s Pencil says the analysis does tell you there “is an intent in taking action about your diet” in these cities.“In Bristol there is a vibrant local community,” says a spokesperson from Chef’s Pencil, “and having a core community of vegans plays a huge role because they’re so active and loud. If you have a vegan friend you will know it.”Bristol has long been seen as place for all things green and liberal. It’s home to the Viva! animal rights campaigning group. Three out of four Bristol MPs say they are vegan or veggie. And the online community Vegan Bristol has a long, thorough list of places that are meat-free.Portland’s vegan voice is equally loud. Paul McCartney and the animal rights campaign group Peta named it the most vegan-friendly city in 2016, even handing the mayor a bouquet of vegetables. Portland has a vegan summer camp, a venue for punk music that also promotes veganism, a vegan shopping mall and even a vegan strip club.The rise of veganism has undoubtedly been led by city dwellers. A 2016 UK survey by the Vegan Society found veganism was significantly more popular in urban areas rather than rural places. Two-thirds of those surveyed who said they didn’t eat meat and avoided dairy products lived in urban and suburban Britain.This is partly due to a greater ease of access to vegan options, according to Sam Calvert from the Vegan Society. A vegan for 24 years, she remembers a lot of friends in previous years saying it would be “too hard” to eat out and find suitable alternatives. With more choices available now, people are more likely to make that leap.“The typical vegan would be young and female, and you’re more likely to find young people in cities,” she says. “As with all communities it’s easier to find more people of the same in cities. There are lots of vegan meet-up groups, which tend to be in cities.”That same year Turin’s new mayor declared the Italian city to be the world’s first “vegan city”.“The promotion of vegan and vegetarian diets is a fundamental act in safeguarding our environment, the health of our citizens and the welfare of our animals,” the city said in a statement. It was intended as programme to raise awareness of sustainability and alternatives to meat, but was unsurprisingly isive.If being a true “vegan city” involved banning the sale of meat or dairy products, then the Gujarat town of Palitana would be on the list. A hunger strike by Jain monks in 2014 led to the local government declaring the city and its holy sites to be meat-free zones.Most lists of vegetarian- or vegan-friendly cities are based on the number of veggie restaurants or cafes in a place rather than the amount of people interested in practising veganism.According to Happy Cow, a crowdsourced list of veggie and vegan restaurants, London is the most vegan-friendly city in the world. It was the first on the site to surpass 100 completely vegan restaurants, in 2017, and currently has 110 vegan eateries in a five-mile radius within the city. It is closely followed by Berlin, with 65 vegan restaurants within a five-mile radius.But perhaps it is all in a name. Last year animal rights activists tried to change the name of the West Country village of Wool to “Vegan Wool”. If the proposal had been accepted by the parish council (it wasn’t), then this unassuming place in Dorset would have surely taken the title of the world’s vegan capital by default.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac8832d7fc4724f18329ed61fbe27d4002a1f5c2/68_0_3364_2019/master/3364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25c71116a9e35d7696dc88656a4b49b8","title":"theresa may compromise brexit","story":"The prime minister has survived a vote of no confidence. Her fate now rests on how flexible she is prepared to beIt is said that the past is a foreign country. But after the Brexit referendum, it is the present, not the past, where we do things differently. No government in British history has taken such a Commons beating as Theresa May suffered on Tuesday. Yet, 24 hours later, the selfsame MPs who had thrown out her UK-EU Brexit deal by 432 votes to 202 now handed her premiership a fresh lifeline. The 118 Conservative MPs who voted her policy down on Tuesday backed her on Wednesday, as though it were the most natural thing in the world to do.By voting by 325 to 306 that they still had confidence in May’s government, the House of Commons turned the ordinary meaning of words on their head. But this wasn’t a vote of confidence in any normal sense. It was a suboptimal tribal choice between a government led by May and one led by Jeremy Corbyn. It was a knockabout partisan ersion from the main national issue, which now resumes. The loss leaves Corbyn with fewer defences against Labour’s second-vote campaigners. But the victory also finds May still wedded to her defeated Brexit policy, and settled in for another year in Downing Street.There is no point in tut-tutting too much about this weird inversion. The Brexit referendum has challenged parliament’s legitimacy. It’s make-it-up-as-you-go-along time now for the Commons as Britain’s representative democracy, with its traditional Burkean emphasis on the assembled judgments of inidual local MPs, battles to accommodate itself to a referendum decision that most members didn’t want. Since June 2016, ministers, political parties and MPs have been continuously struggling to adjust, sometimes with the kind of bizarre consequences that we have witnessed this week.Get used to it, because the article 50 timetable is an implacable taskmaster. There are just 72 days before Brexit takes effect, on 29 March. Every day brings a new issue for MPs to focus on. Now the attention will shift to article 50. Unless it is stopped to permit the consideration of new options, such as a second referendum, or unless the withdrawal agreement MPs rejected this week is reinstated fairly soon in a different form, with a better prospect of success, Britain will tumble out of the EU with no deal – an outcome that most MPs say they oppose but which became more likely on Tuesday night.“What happens now?” is the question of the hour. May said on Tuesday that the government was listening to parliament. She has no alternative. But she has been a terrible listener in the past, and she has shown little appetite for serious listening in the last 48 hours either. After her win tonight she repeated Tuesday’s pledge to reach out to “parliamentarians” about ways forward. But that pledge is narrowly drawn. She remains foolishly focused on the priority of persuading Tory and DUP rebels to support her, not on looking for agreements with Labour or other opposition MPs.The days for that partisan approach are gone. She is in this mess because it does not work. She may be the least worst leader the Tory party has on offer, but she’s no Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with the magic touch. The penny dropped during the day that she would get nowhere if she insisted, as Andrea Leadsom appeared to say this morning, that she would not talk to Jeremy Corbyn and other party leaders but would instead talk directly to Labour and other opposition backbenchers.She can’t pick and choose whom to talk to. If she did so, she would hang them out to dry in their own parties. And she can’t insist on too many preconditions either. It is fair enough for May to insist that the goal, if she genuinely reaches out, is to deliver a Brexit opposition MPs will support. But that Brexit can only be a different one from the one she tried and failed to persuade her own party and the DUP to support this week. She has to be ready to compromise, and to change her red lines. She has to be open to ruling out a no-deal exit, to extending article 50, to a form of permanent customs union that would effectively eliminate the Northern Ireland backstop problem, and to guaranteed regulatory alignments with the single market.If she takes that approach, she will be denounced by the Tory extreme right. But she lives with that problem already. The extreme right denounces her anyway. They vote against her, both as party leader and on Brexit. They don’t want a compromise. They want no deal. They want a bonfire of the regulations. They don’t care about climate change, the “just about managing”, the union or Ireland.But if she reaches out in the way she has so far failed to do – and perhaps now understands that she must – she may yet get her Brexit through parliament. It is a mistake to say that “May’s deal” is dead. It isn’t. The withdrawal agreement part of last November’s UK-EU deal has widespread support in the Commons. Most MPs support its three key features: reciprocal post-Brexit rights for citizens, a settlement of the UK’s debts and the avoidance of a hard border in Ireland.The problem for Commons moderates is with the second, shorter part of May’s deal, the political declaration on the future relationship with the EU. Here May fudged almost everything last November, kicking the can into the transition period because she is fearful of antagonising her own party on future economic ties with the EU. That fudge prevents Brexit pragmatists on the opposition benches from backing her deal. They would be buying a pig in a poke, in which they might end up facilitating a hard, deregulatory Brexit.Yet this is also, potentially, an opportunity for those pragmatists and for May to come together. If she and they can agree a domestic deal on the goals of the future relationship, to last until the next election in 2022, she might get her Brexit and they might get the regulatory alignment, customs union and soft border in Ireland they seek. Something similar might be achieved under a so-called Norway plus deal. If she is really daring, she might even craft a devolution-of-powers deal that the SNP, which has its own party leadership problems, might grab at, as might Welsh Labour. Tonight the SNP’s Ian Blackford, a practical man fallen among fanatics, sounded cautiously interested. All this would mean Britain leaving the EU – which is why it would stick in the throat of us pro-Europeans – but it would keep Britain a more European society.Franklin Roosevelt was the greatest political leader of the 20th century for many reasons. One of these was his pragmatic flexibility. Roosevelt believed the seriousness of the crisis that faced America in the 1930s required “persistent experimentation”. He once said it was common sense to try a policy and “if it fails, admit it frankly and try another”. It is the profoundest political common sense too. It allows a politician to fail yet retain trust. May can hardly be compared with Roosevelt. But he wrote the playbook that she needs to follow at this dire moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a614ae9de6fceed9adc9517546d8e7db7934e12/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f835cefccfa0c70046e99f0e9d1f1afc","title":"bitcoin big oil environment energy","story":"As a Bitcoin maker who covered the oil industry as a journalist, I see parallels between the two that may haunt cryptocurrencyI make Bitcoin, and in a previous life, I covered the oil industry as a journalist. Increasingly, I’m realizing the two worlds are alike. Bitcoin is oil.And one day, Bitcoin will become big oil, and all who dabble in it will be reborn as enemies of the environmental movement, seen as plunderers of the planet and the bad guys in the fight against climate change – just like oil.Bitcoin’s environmental footprint will haunt it. Nobody has pointed this out, but it is painfully clear: if we can at all predict an industry’s growth by that of a different one, then oil is Bitcoin’s crystal ball.Most cryptocurrencies, of which Bitcoin is the first and most valuable, are created by running servers to crunch mathematical puzzles, or “mining”.I have a facility that does that in Canada’s oil capital of Calgary, and its business model is similar to that of the city’s dominant industry. Both profit by generating and selling a product whose price swings with supply and demand. Some in Calgary partake in both.The cryptocurrency world is bigger than mining, just as the vaguely defined big oil is more than those who extract crude. But shares in either industry move in sync with the value of the underlying asset.While oil has tangible uses, most buying and selling is done on paper by traders seeking profit, with barrels never changing hands. Long ago, I learned cryptocurrency trading from oil professionals.Then there is the environment. Oil is a big offender. So is Bitcoin. Mining uses as much power as a small country, according to some estimates. Miners compete for limited coins, resulting in an arms race, and that power usage increases constantly and rapidly.The two industries are hardly the only environmental offenders, but they make great targets. Oil is currently the biggest one. That is in part because the industry is prominent, represented internationally by organized and high-profile groups. Attacks on it are visible.Environmentalists also see oil as futureless and unnecessary. Cars pollute, but few protest outside a General Motors factory – one day, its products could all be electric, but oil remains forever oil.Those two points apply well to Bitcoin. “How to buy Bitcoin” was third-ranked in Google’s how-to searches for 2017. With mergers and acquisitions more than doubling in 2018, cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly organized.Big cryptocurrency players have been accused of price manipulation, and their conflicts have rocked the market. Sounds just like the Saudi Arabia-dominated Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel.Bitcoin, too, has been accused by pundits of being futureless and unnecessary. It does have great potential to revolutionize finance, but a decade after its birth, the everyday person still has no practical use for it.Granted, the total value of all cryptocurrencies is only one-tenth of the over-$1tn worth of oil produced every year. But the International Energy Agency has said global oil demand will peak by 2040, as the world seeks cleaner energy.It is not this day, but a day may come when big oil shrinks or changes, becoming less of a target for environmentalists. Bitcoin is the natural next enemy.The caveat is that cryptocurrency continues to grow. Bitcoin – both the currency and industry – has endured worse crashes than 2018’s and emerged stronger. But the past is no map for the future.The battle lines, however, are already being drawn. While academics and the media have long noted mining’s electricity usage, 2018 marked the year environmental and progressive publications started sounding the alarm.Last December, a writer for the green publication Treehugger gloated over the cryptocurrency’s fall in price: “Bitcoin is a colossal waste of energy that will soon be no more.

This is the day, in theory, when the country turns remain. Even if not a single person has changed their mind since the referendum, the demographic shift alone will have done the heavy lifting. Enough old leavers will have died and enough young remainers will have come on to the electoral register to turn the dial on what the country thinks about Brexit.The psephologist and founding YouGov president, Peter Kellner, calculates that the leave vote has been declining by about 1,350 a day, taking into account the differential turnout: the young turn out to vote much less often than the old. By using exactly the same proportion of every age group turning out to vote exactly as they did in 2016, demographics alone will have transformed the UK into a remainer nation.The true “will of the people” looks considerably more questionable if it turns out to be the will of dead people – not the will of those who have the most life ahead of them to face the consequences. Does this guarantee remain would win a referendum this year? Of course not. People are changing their minds, though polls show predominant movement in the pro-remain direction. But once a ferocious campaign gets under way there’s no knowing what might swing opinion. No one expected the leavers’ two toxic lies to spring out of the wicked imagination of the likes of Dominic Cummings and Michael Gove – £350m a week extra for the NHS and 70 million Turks destined for our shores.It’s right to fear how much further they might go in the case of a second referendum, always wrong-footing a painfully fact-based gentler remain campaign. I like the remain campaigners’ self-mocking and unshrill homemade placards on their upbeat Ode to Joy demonstrations: “Brexit – is it worth it?”, “This doesn’t seem very well thought through”, “Let’s call the whole thing off”, “CakeNotHate”,”I want to have my gateau and share it”, “I want my continent back”. Will the remainers be up to the bare-knuckle bloody fistfight of a bitter second round? Factual rebuttals are so much harder to explain than crude bare-faced lies. Can they ensure young fresh faces lead, and muzzle Tony Blair, whose Today programme contribution this morning was singularly unhelpful.One placard outside Westminster on Tuesday night read: “Who’s afraid of a people’s vote?” The answer, of course, is the leavers. Why would it anger them so much if they didn’t fear losing? They say another vote would “disrespect” democracy. But what a curious argument to suggest that when all else fails in parliament, asking the people to decide between options not available last time is somehow undemocratic.The long-time Eurosceptic Charles Moore writes in the  that Brexiters should boycott any such referendum: that can only be because they fear remain is on the rise. As for the first result being fixed in the firmament for all time, they never say for how long exactly. It will be three years since the last, so should it be five, 10, or “never, never, never!”, as old Ian Paisley Sr would be bellowing? Democracy is kinetic, on the move, as mercifully people do change their minds with changing circumstances – and populations change.A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal. As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government. That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit. “The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs. Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.Theresa May’s inexplicable intransigence makes a referendum more likely as the only resolution left available. Reaching out? With her Paisleyite steel-trap mentality, she refuses to cross any of the fatal red lines that set her on the wrong course from the start: no customs union, no free movement, no European court to oversee agreements. She cleaves to her hard Brexiters, more afraid of splitting her party than sinking her country.Jeremy Corbyn has rightly laid down just one essential red line: no no-deal Brexit. That’s the only fixed point that parliament agrees is the disaster to be averted at all costs, cabinet ministers ready to resign to stop it. But a soft Brexit where Britain obeys all rules but loses its voice and its veto over them doesn’t have his party’s support. The will of his party will before long oblige him to opt for a vote: his members overwhelmingly back one, including Momentum’s great heft. His voters are in favour, and they are mainly remainers.Labour is caught between a small number of Labour leave voters, who are often swing voters in certain seats, and the overwhelming number of Labour remainers. Kellner warns that “it would be suicidal if Labour were to facilitate Brexit”, causing a stampede against it in all the metropolitan and university seats that are also Labour heartlands. Labour needs to win in both the Mansfields and its new turf in the Kensingtons and Canterburys. Brexit is an entirely Tory project: Labour must always be internationalist remainers. Corbyn and his close circle will find the only way out of the conundrum is to ask the people. Parliament will need to force this on May – and secretly, even if she doesn’t know it, it will be a relief to her, solving her dilemma too.No one sensible bets on what happens next. Parliament must seize control in parliament when there is, in effect, no government. But logic – if logic were to prevail – suggests the only answer that will rescue both party leaders is to have a great national consultation and a referendum imposed upon them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb4354043cc649b5c20e6551cc54c83b991ab700/0_21_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c47a4d975a6d9b34ab2311fa9637e09","title":"semi brexit england wales leaving eu solution","story":"If Scotland and Northern Ireland remained, as voters there wanted, it would open the door to a better deal all round When all solutions are bad, it’s time to reinvent the problem. Is it still possible to honour the initial Brexit referendum without crossing the EU’s red lines? Yes – through semi-Brexit.The UK is ided into four nations, two of which voted remain and two of which voted leave. The British government could honour those decisions and allow Scotland and Northern Ireland to remain in the EU as the successor state to the UK, while permitting England and Wales (if it still wants to) to exit.Semi-Brexit does not mean breaking up the UK. Rather the reverse: semi-Brexit may be the only way to hold the UK together. If the UK drags Scotland and Northern Ireland out of the EU, the chances of a UK breakup are much higher. But if Scotland and Northern Ireland remain, then England and Wales would have more flexibility to negotiate a better deal. Third states – that is, states outside the EU – cannot cherry-pick the bits of the EU that they want and reject those bits they don’t. But parts of EU member states that are otherwise outside the EU can.At least 35 countries and territories already have special deals with the EU that include, for example, free movement of goods into the EU without triggering the free movement of EU nationals back. Or deals that include something close to free trade without the jurisdiction of the European court of justice (ECJ). And on and on and on. The combinations of inside-EU privileges with extra-EU independence are very nearly endless. And they already exist.There’s just one catch: the territories that get to cherry-pick from the EU in these ways must remain constitutionally attached to a current EU member state. From “outermost regions” (nine of them) to “overseas territories” (25 of them) to bespoke agreements with the EU on the part of special regions (a half dozen or so), far-flung – and not so far-flung – territories have worked out special arrangements with the EU through their associated member state.One does not have to look far to see how. The Isle of Man has free trade with the EU for agricultural and manufactured products but is otherwise not bound by EU law. Guernsey has free trade in goods more generally, but no EU nationals have free movement rights into Guernsey. In fact, the array of models one could use for a bespoke deal for England and Wales is nearly endless. But getting these options requires part of the UK to stay in the EU.How would this be possible? The EU law questions are relatively easy while the heavy lifting, legally speaking, falls to UK constitutional law. The ECJ has just held that the UK can halt article 50 unilaterally. By doing that, the UK could put its negotiations with the EU on a different track.Of course, the EU wouldn’t tolerate an open-ended Brexit process wreaking havoc with long-term planning. The EU would have to know soon how to figure the UK into its parliamentary election cycle in 2019 and new budget cycle shortly after that. If, however, the UK were to announce that Scotland and Northern Ireland were staying in the EU while England and Wales exited, then the number of MEPs the new UK should elect in the new European parliament follows a formula. Ditto with the budget contribution. With these adjustments, the EU could go ahead and plan its future.Once the UK’s parameters in Europe were settled, the EU could begin negotiations with England and Wales over a new long-term relationship. The EU framework for special territories has no draconian deadlines – by contrast with the short deadlines of article 50.The harder transitional questions fall in UK constitutional law. The Westminster parliament would have to give the four nations the power to make international agreements in their own name so that each could remain a member of the EU (or not) separately. All subject areas covered by EU law would have to be devolved from Westminster to the four nations so that they could ensure harmonisation of their laws with EU law (or not).In the current UK constitution, however, the four nations are not equal: England would have to acquire its own parliament to receive the devolution. This idea has been well mooted already so plans are already available. In fact, the creation of an English parliament would bring self-government home even more dramatically than Brexiteers promised.Beyond that, there are questions about how to organise borders for whatever would not flow freely between the EU and the part of the UK that left. To control the flow of people, England and Wales could require residency and work permits for foreigners who live and work on its territory while the part of the UK that remained in the EU would allow free movement. UK corporations that wanted the benefits of EU status could reincorporate in Scotland while keeping their current offices in London – and charging a reasonable reincorporation tax would float Scotland’s budget again.In semi-Brexit, England and Wales might be able to negotiate free movement of exports under arrangements similar to those of the Channel Islands. If the EU were unwilling to go that far, however, arrangements for the movement of goods would, under this proposal, at least be displaced from the fraught international border between the UK and Ireland to the less-fraught borders between England and Wales and the rest of the UK. Without the pressing March deadline of article 50, these questions could be resolved in their own time. Perhaps Northern Ireland could even form a government by then.If England and Wales wanted one day to get back into the EU after semi-Brexit, re-entry would be easier than if the whole UK left. A single unanimous vote of the European council is sufficient for re-entry. In the process of re-entry, England and Wales would not lose all of their special agreements and opt-outs because the remaining UK would retain them.With semi-Brexit, the UK could honour the referendum and allow each part of the UK to get what it voted for. Semi-Brexit would also give the EU a graceful way to provide a better deal for England and Wales. Isn’t semi-Brexit, then, the least worst path forward?• Kim Lane Scheppele is the Laurance S Rockefeller professor of sociology and international affairs at Princeton University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77f547997acd201c6db88ba7eb4cfec33e5d569e/0_62_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20f14557f3a9b7821293fcf5edb8e72f","title":"ofsted inspections find three steiner schools to be inadequate","story":"Concerns raised about safeguarding, bullying and high exclusion ratesThe future of state-funded Steiner education has been thrown into doubt after a series of snap Ofsted inspections found that three of the four such schools set up under the Conservatives’ free school programme were “inadequate”.The four have been inspected in recent weeks – alongside private Steiner schools, a number of which have also been found to be inadequate – following an intervention by the education secretary, Damian Hinds, over concerns about safeguarding.Ofsted reports for the Frome and Bristol Steiner academies are due to be published later this week, but have been shared with parents. Copies seen by the  reveal inspectors’ concerns about a wide range of issues, including safeguarding, bullying and lack of support for children with special educational needs and disabilities.The Frome report accuses leaders and governors of failing to provide pupils with a safe and effective education, due to a lack of understanding about the current statutory requirements.It says the school failed to address serious issues that “put pupils at risk of harm”, that some behaviour management is “disproportionate and unsafe” and safeguarding is “not effective”. The inspection team, which visited in November, also raised concerns about a high number of exclusions, most of which were for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities.The report for Bristol, which is also due to be published imminently, similarly details concerns about safeguarding. “Pupils are exposed to avoidable risk of harm,” it says. “Physical intervention is used unnecessarily.” It adds that bullying incidents are too frequent, and disadvantaged pupils and those with special educational needs make insufficient progress.The damning assessments follow similar findings at the Exeter Steiner academy – another state-funded school – which is being transferred to a multi-academy trust after being found inadequate by Ofsted. The fourth state-funded Steiner school, in Hereford, was judged good.The wave of inspections have prompted some parents to complain of a “witch hunt” against Steiner schools. At Bristol, parents have been told the board of governors have sent a legal letter to Ofsted, challenging the inspection report and the inspection process.The school refused to comment on the Ofsted report until publication, but principal Joss Hayes said: “We take the judgments in the Ofsted inspection very seriously and have already acted on many of its findings. We have implemented additional training for all staff and are committed to ensuring that the school makes improvements in key areas.”Frome is also planning to challenge the report and the inspection process. A spokesman for the trustees said: “When the government endorsed Steiner education in the state system and approved Steiner Academy Frome to open as a free school back in 2012, it was an acknowledgement of the importance of choice and creativity within the education system. Clearly this struck a chord for many families within the community, and continues to do so.”Both schools will go into special measures and multi-academy trusts will be sought to take over. Parents fear that the Steiner ethos – the very reason they chose those schools for their children – will be lost in the process.One Frome parent said the Ofsted report did not reflect her experience of the school in any way. “Our experience of the school has been very positive. We see how happy our children are every day and what great progress they are making.“I don’t have any concerns about safeguarding. I’m confident the school will make any changes they need to. For us the key thing is that the Steiner ethos and curriculum are not lost.”Another Frome parent, who rejected the “inadequate” judgment from Ofsted (“that’s just not our experience”) said he felt Steiner schools were facing a hostile environment. “They offered us the opportunity to have a school with a different approach. It’s not appropriate to now criticise the school for having a Steiner curriculum. That was the deal they made with us when the school started.”Hinds called in November for additional scrutiny of Steiner schools by Ofsted after the chief inspector of schools in England, Amanda Spielman, raised concerns about safeguarding in the sector on the back of two earlier inspections.In a letter to her, Hinds said while there was evidence of effective safeguarding in some Steiner schools in both the state and independent sectors, the incidence of safeguarding issues in the independent Steiner schools appeared to be higher than average for the sector.He commissioned Ofsted to carry out a series of inspections and report back to him at the end of the spring term. Meanwhile, the School Inspection Service – an independent organisation with expertise in Steiner methods, which has in the past inspected private Steiner schools – has now closed.Asked to comment, an Ofsted spokesman said: “The inspection reports speak for themselves.”The Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship (SWSF) is the membership organisation for all 31 Steiner schools and 14 independent early years settings in the UK and Ireland. A spokesperson said: “SWSF, which has operated in the UK since 1953, acknowledges the important role Ofsted fulfils, and welcomes honest, informed feedback to guide school improvement.“Steiner Waldorf schools across the UK and Ireland are run independently from SWSF, each with their own governing body. Our role is to provide guidance and advice, so that schools are informed to meet regulatory requirements set out by the Department for Education and all other relevant authorities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da5b35d2b9bbb118530e683274efddf0f861fea6/0_37_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c25a165dbe0943c4e72a9b7478a37d31","title":"university should be free for all students not just the wealthiest","story":"This confounds higher education policymakers, who assume that students and their families will make decisions rationally. After all, it doesn’t make sense to pay tuition upfront, since there’s a considerable chance that at least some of the debt will be written off by the government. What is missing from the tuition fees discussion is awareness of the multiple functions of taxation. Generating revenue is only one reason to tax citizens another is to incentivise certain investments over others. The current system of higher education fees has led, for example, to the disinvestment in vocational further education among cohorts who could potentially benefit from these courses, since university courses provide access to loans upfront with lower risk. Taxation also provides a mechanism for societies to prevent the build up of unearned economic advantages among the children of the wealthy. In other words, a genuinely progressive tax system can mitigate the development of aristocracies.This is why the Intergenerational Foundation report’s conclusion that a free, public university system paid through direct grants would be “too expensive” is wrong. Citing the truism that free higher education would benefit middle-class students more often than others, their recommendations ignore the fact that it would also benefit everyone else. All students should be encouraged to enrol on courses according to need, function and for its own sake.More importantly, we ignore the fact that the wealthiest young people get to start life with a considerable head start, while their classmates begin their working lives in considerable debt.Accordingly, the lesson from the government’s tuition fee experiment is a simple one: tax wealthy working adults to invest properly in public universities. That way every student can have what wealthy students at present take for granted: access to free higher education."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/245df3fa884bbad59a1807518c4d519b1d5e8ea3/83_0_1790_1074/master/1790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=935915e0f98aeeef5645ebf8a51ad2eb","title":"hale county this morning this evening review laura poitras ramell ross documentary alabama","story":"Executive produced by Laura Poitras, this documentary RaMell Ross is a revelatory study of African American livesRaMell Ross’s Hale County This Morning, This Evening is a beautifully realised documentary study of African American real lives in Hale County, Alabama. To some degree, it can be seen as a creative or intellectual response to Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, the classic 1941 work of photo-reportage by James Agee and photographer Walker Evans that recorded the lives of depression-hit white sharecroppers from Hale County. But as film-making, it is more personal and engaged than simply that: it feels as if Ross has created a sustained kind of euphoria, a 76-minute epiphany of love for his community, and the use over the closing credits of Billie Holiday singing Stars Fell on Alabama is very moving.The director developed this project from coaching basketball and studying photography, activities that allowed him intimate access to high-school and college kids and to their families’ lives – at school, in college, on the basketball court, in church, hanging out. You might call his resulting film À Propos de Hale County, were it not for the resonance and passionate empathy of its tone, far from satire. It is an ambient study, or mosaic of moments, slices of life with only the most discreet and unemphasised single narrative thread – a couple who are about to give birth to twins, one of which is, heartrendingly, to succumb to sudden infant death syndrome.One of the film’s executive producers is Laura Poitras (who made Citizenfour, about Edward Snowden) and its creative adviser is Thai photographer and film-maker Apichatpong Weerasethakul. The influence of each can be seen here. There is an edge of realist steel and a shimmer of insight. The music and the sound design are at least as important as the imagery, especially in one extended scene (using what is perhaps a locked-off shot with the director not present), showing guys in the locker room, preparing for a basketball game. The scene runs at some length. Here is some horsing around, some needle between two men that seems to escalate into a brief, abandoned confrontation. The throb and shudder of the music (from Alex Somers, Scott Alario and Forest Kelley) suggest the emotional turbulence beneath an innocuous present.Elsewhere, things are less turbulent: animals and landscape are made to wobble and rotate using timelapse photography. A shot aimed up at the night sky through a basketball hoop shows the stars drifting through it. Ross has a fondness for little kids, using their innocence and pathos. His camera follows a toddler running endlessly back and forth in front of a television. It is a deadpan scene, but allows us to ponder how short life is, and how soon the child will grow up to be one of the teenagers elsewhere in the film. At one stage, a mom in the front passenger seat of a car offers her blank-faced toddler a high-five before playfully grabbing her face and letting it go – a couple of times. The child’s trusting vulnerability has such sweetness in that moment. Ross’s camera recording another such conversation between mother and child is mysteriously distracted by leaves tumbling across the sidewalk.At times, Ross intersperses scenes with intertitles: “What is the orbit of our dreaming?” and “How do we not frame someone?” The statements muse on artistic shape, its form and content, what to leave in and out. Framing is a vital artistic question for the photographer and film-maker. Ross rephrases it as not framing someone: perhaps as a reference to crime, punishment and justice? A quotidian scene will mysteriously cut to kids outside in an electric storm, the sky dark with thunder. It reminded me of Orson Welles’s statement that filming is human but editing is ine. There is something visionary in this film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2336397575b2ecbdc2306627d8eb3604057d7442/226_0_1430_858/master/1430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f0ec55afad9d6ce8938426b2c6b6bc4","title":"monsters and men review reinaldo marcus green john david washington anthony ramos","story":"Reinaldo Marcus Green’s tough drama follows the fortunes of three young African-American men who find their loyalties ided – and their futures in perilRage, fear and a wrenching sadness hang over this tough picture by first-timer Reinaldo Marcus Green. It’s a drama inspired by, among other cases, that of Eric Garner, the black man in New York who in 2014 resisted arrest for selling single cigarettes for loose change on a street corner, and died in a police officer’s chokehold as an onlooker filmed the event on his phone.Green imagines a triptych of young African-American men, all affected in various ways by an incident like this and all caught in a fundamental crisis of loyalty – a loyalty to their community and opposing loyalty to their own terrifyingly precarious futures, in which they had hoped to keep their heads down and make their way in this compromised world. These are the futures desperately wished for them by their careworn parents’ generation, futures that could so easily be capsized by the tiniest bit of boat-rocking.John David Washington (from Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman) plays New York detective Dennis Williams, who is up for promotion. Anthony Ramos (who played Lady Gaga’s best friend in A Star Is Born) is Manny, a nice guy from the neighbourhood with a partner and baby, involved in a little wrongdoing but on the verge of turning things around by getting a job as a security guard. Kelvin Harrison Jr is Zyrick, or Zee, a hardworking high-school kid with a wonderful talent for baseball that could be his ticket to glory. But the talent scouts don’t want to hear about trouble with the police.Green allows us to grasp the irony that in wanting a security guard’s job, Manny is auditioning to be a kind of police officer. He has to wear a suit and sit behind the front desk in the building’s lobby. He has to learn the police officer’s technique of asking people who they are, what they want, and gauge their behaviour. Most importantly and ironically, he has to master surveillance. Visitors to the building have to look into a camera to have their face recorded.So perhaps it is no surprise that when he sees a friend of his being harassed by police on a Brooklyn street corner, he takes out his phone and films something very incriminating, and is then is confronted by the reality of police officers who are quite willing to frame Manny in revenge.As for Zee, he is stopped and searched by cops who are, interestingly, mollified by the information that he is on his way back from a baseball practice – not basketball, a sport that the police clearly associate with anti-authority and black defiance. Again, Green creates a nauseous irony: the cops didn’t find a certain something that Zee actually had on him. In all their racism and arrogance, it looks as if they have scared Zee straight. But he can’t forgive them. When he reached into his pocket, jittery cops asked what he was doing. But the information that it’s just a cellphone he’s getting out did not calm them. The point is that smartphones with cameras are as threatening as guns.Dennis is a cop who must frequently suffer the humiliation of being pulled over in his car by other white officers when he’s off duty. The film conveys his swallowed disgust, as the loud music Dennis had been cheerfully playing has had to be snapped off as he waits for the officer to approach, to be replaced by the eerie heartbeat of his dashboard’s ticking. And the officers are not immediately appeased by Dennis producing his own badge: they have to check if one has been stolen. Yet, despite his fury at the racism inside his profession, Dennis is blindsided by emotion when two of his fellow officers are killed on the job, and he is moved by the impromptu prayer in the station house followed by the big public funeral. Doesn’t he owe the police his trust? Isn’t this the larger issue?The strange resonances and contradictions echo back and forth between these three characters, one of whom is disturbingly withdrawn from the action, never to return. We simply never find out his ending. As well as all this, Green is able to tilt the tone of his movie towards humour and gentleness.I laughed when Dennis hosts a dinner party and one of his guests reveals that they have a new cat, Simba, named after The Lion King. Instantly, Dennis raises his glass and proposes a toast: “All that the light touches!” And for a moment, everyone’s adult sadnesses vanish, replaced by happy memories of childhood. There is humanity and complexity in this welcome movie, as well as muscular power and unreconciled anger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/413576e43bfcdf9c10743a12a896b4b9608e11aa/370_323_3061_1837/master/3061.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc6aa61503869ee46706442d6e4c33ad","title":"fortnite dances removed forza horizon 4","story":"Playground Games drops ‘Carlton and Floss’ emotes from driving game as Epic faces fourth lawsuit for alleged Fortnite copyright infringementTwo dance moves that are the subject of lawsuits in the US have been removed from the driving game Forza Horizon 4.The moves were among a series of dance “emotes” included in the latest instalment of the Forza Horizon series, after the huge popularity of similar dances in Fortnite.However, in December, Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, was hit with a series of lawsuits alleging copyright infringement on three dances in the game. Among these were the Floss and the Carlton Dance (said to be known in Fortnite as “Fresh”) – the two dances that have been removed from Forza Horizon 4.Four artists have now filed copyright infringement actions against Epic. Russell Horning, known online as the Backpack Kid, claims to have invented the Floss move, which has become a phenomenon since it was included in Fortnite. Meanwhile, rapper 2 Milly claims his Milly Rock dance has been copied in the game, and Alfonso Ribeiro claims he created the Carlton Dance for an episode of the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. On Monday, a fourth lawsuit was launched, this time from the mother of Fortnite fan Orange Shirt Kid, whose Orange Justice dance is included in the game.Copyright infringement lawsuits around dances and dance moves are difficult to prove. Although in US law, choreography is protected under the 1976 Copyright Act, plaintiffs have to show that they originated not only a single move but a series of moves in a complex sequence, and must provide proof in video form. There is already ambiguity over the origins of both the Floss and the Carlton dances, with evidence suggesting they may have been performed earlier by other dancers, the former in a YouTube video from 2012 and the latter in a Bruce Springsteen video.Forza Horizon creator Playground Games has not explained why the dances have been removed.

He pointed to large crowds in Budapest that protested against Orbán’s moves to shut down Central European University and to enact a “slave law” that increases permissible overtime and allows three-year delays in paying for overtime.A high point, cited by the report, came in September, when the European parliament responded to Orbán’s increasingly authoritarian rule by voting to launch a process that could end with political sanctions under article 7 of the EU Treaty.The group also pointed to Democrat gains in the House of Representatives in the autumn midterms as evidence of the increasing rejection of Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric.Elsewhere, the organisation pointed to transfers of power that it says reflected clear human rights concerns, citing voters in Malaysia and the Males who ousted their corrupt prime ministers.Acknowledging, however, that the trend had not all been positive, the report added that the current crop of autocrats were continuing in their efforts to undermine democracy by scapegoating and demonising vulnerable minorities to build popular support.China came in for particular criticism in the report, which observed: “China has increased its repression over the past year to the worst levels since the 1989 massacre of protesters from the Tiananmen Square democracy movement.“The authorities broadened their assault on freedom of expression, detaining journalists, prosecuting activists, tightening ideological control over universities, and expanding internet censorship.”“Autocrats’ failure to protect basic human rights has made it easier for brutal leaders to get away with mass atrocities, such as Syria’s attacks on civilians in areas held by anti-government forces and the Saudi-led coalition’s indiscriminate and disproportionate bombing and blockading of Yemeni civilians.”The report said much of the pushback in the past year had played out at the UN, underlining its continuing importance as an institution.“Beyond its important action on Myanmar and Yemen, the UN human rights council adopted for the first time a resolution condemning the severe repression in Venezuela under President Nicolás Maduro.“Five Latin American governments and Canada urged the international criminal court to open an investigation of crimes in Venezuela – the first time that any governments have sought an ICC investigation of crimes that took place entirely outside their territory.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89b989f63333e5b31cd0cbd473873dc8eb472fbe/0_29_2440_1464/master/2440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e22287431482c14554d172362eb2ae4","title":"podcast future of education","story":"How can education be improved?

If so, let us know by sharing your thoughts with our panel of education experts to examine what can be done to improve education, and make systems more equal. Whether you’re a teacher, student, academic, social worker, policymaker, parent, and wherever you are in the world, we want to hear from you.This is what Alex Beard, author of Natural Born Learners, and one of our panellists for this podcast, has to say:“Most schools today are not teaching kids how to learn. We lack a common understanding of what education is and what purpose it serves. We set national targets and arrange institutions and organise people so that they can deliver on those targets. This managerial thinking has been around for 100 years. But by standardising things in this way across classrooms, you undermine the efforts of educators.”In an increasingly interdependent world, it’s vital that we strive to understand not just what it is that makes other societies tick, but how others – be they British, Japanese, German or Argentinian – endeavour to solve the same problems that we all share. In this month’s podcast, we will be focusing on the issue of education, and how we as a global community can improve standards of education for children of all nationalities, genders, ethnicities and economic backgrounds.What are the techniques and methods we can all use to reform education models? How far are they needed, and how far can they stretch? Wendy Kopp explains the extent of the issue in her article ‘It’ll take a village to reform global education’:“More than 60 percent of primary school children in low- and middle- income countries do not reach a minimum proficiency in reading and math. We’re even further from ensuring the world’s children gain the competencies and dispositions necessary to shape a better future for themselves and all of us.”One thing is clear: the learning crisis is severe. But the conversation on education still needs to shift towards an understanding that this is a crisis that needs fixing – we know where we want to get to, but we don’t yet know how to get there. Of course, what works in one country might not work entirely in another, but recognising that there are other ways to do things might be a good place to start.What are the common issues we all face? What approaches have you seen implemented, or helped to implement, and what beneficial changes have been brought about in the systems you work in?Now we’d like to hear from you.

It was hard not to be impressed by his eponymous 2011 debut album, but it was equally hard not to wonder whether this really was the stuff of which silver medals in the BBC Sound of … poll and spots on the Radio 1 A-list were made. If you listened to its sparse, abstract, deeply uncommercial assemblages of treated vocals, electronics and piano, there was something very odd indeed about his name being mentioned in the same breath as Jessie J.But look at him now: ensconced in sunny LA with a celebrity girlfriend, the actor Jameela Jamil, his mobile number apparently in every major rapper’s phone, so he’s can be reached on speed dial whenever a melancholy voice is required. His solo albums have sold solidly, not spectacularly, but a list of prior collaborators – Kendrick Lamar, Frank Ocean, Kanye West, Beyoncé, Chance the Rapper, Future, Jay-Z, Vince Staples – offers evidence of a man embedded at the centre of pop culture.He has good reason to feel pleased, which explains Assume Form. His last album, the utterly downcast The Colour in Anything, so amplified the frail, introverted, careworn aspects of his sound that it started to feel rather too whiny and self-pitying for its own good. By contrast, its follow-up arrives bearing songs called things like Mile High, Barefoot in the Park and Can’t Believe the Way We Flow.The guest list reveals Blake’s well-connected status: Travis Scott, chart-topping trap producer  Boomin and Outkast’s André 3000. The latter’s verse, over scrabbling electric guitar and a gently chugging house beat on Where’s the Catch is a mercifully more palatable representation of their musical kinship than the 17-minute instrumental improvisation on piano and bass clarinet the pair released on SoundCloud last year. The music, meanwhile, is noticeably more pop-facing than its predecessors. Such things are obviously relative – Blake’s songs are frequently still winding and episodic and flecked with lapses into silence: on the title track, scattered electronic blips crash out of time against a fluttering piano line and sped-up female voices.But some of its pleasures are remarkably straightforward. I’ll Come Too sounds appealingly like the kind of songs Harry Nilsson used to write when feeling inspired by pop from the pre-rock’n’roll era. Based around an iridescent sample from the Manhattans’ 1977 single It Feels So Good to Be Loved So Bad, Blake’s Can’t Believe the Way We Flow is a blissful, lovely update of the sound that emerged when practitioners of soft 70s soul keyed into the sleepy, small-hours feel of doo-wop ballads. The mood of budding romance is kept from feeling sickly by the darkness lurking at its edges. Barefoot in the Park, which features a star turn by Spanish singer Rosalía, doesn’t just share its title with the Neil Simon play, but its theme: its protagonist is fragile and shut in, there’s a faint sense of distrust about their embrace of happiness.Without wishing to rain on Blake’s new-found romantic contentment, there are drawbacks. His voice is naturally lugubrious: perfect for expressing racked sorrow, useful for adding the slightly uncertain edge to Barefoot in the Park, but not really the ideal vehicle for conveying unbridled lust. There’s something jarring about hearing Blake lowing mournfully away in the background while Travis Scott hymns the pleasures of having it off on a plane on Mile High – a bit like the high-altitude bunk-up is being hampered by another passenger knocking on the toilet door and asking how much longer you’re going to be in there. You suspect there’s supposed to be a lubricious charge behind Tell Them, with its talk of getting what you came for in the dead of night, but when Blake takes over lead vocals from guest Moses Sumney, it just sounds odd and wheedling. “Tell them what you’ve been there dreaming about,” he quavers, as if threatening to burst into tears if she doesn’t, a passion-killer if ever there was one.He’s no great shakes as a kind of Barry White for Burial fans, but that’s Assume Form’s only real flaw. The Colour in Anything sounded like a blind alley, so lost in its own personal misery that it had no interest in really connecting with anyone else. Assume Form feels like Blake opening out, adding fresh, noticeably brighter colours to his sonic palette. Whether or not a smidge more commerciality turns this album into the kind of hit he was predicted to have at the start of the decade, it is immensely pleasing to witness an artist who seemed to be at a dead end now moving forward.BbyMutha: Sleeping With the EnemyThe torrential 2018 output of the self-styled “black Marge Simpson” involved rapping over everything from Grimes tracks to disquieting electronic noise. This is pure pop by comparison: guest vocal from “rogue R\u0026ampB” singer Kindora indelible, joyous guitar sample, a delight from start to finish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/148d353a18c7d86bb7df699c9ba6bf08c66a3d70/0_75_4621_2773/master/4621.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68205b815a2d45f70414bd72912ea65a","title":"lpo alsop review soundstate festival andriessen","story":"Royal Festival Hall, LondonErkki-Sven Tüür’s climate change protest and Andriessen’s Homeric musical story were the highlights of a varied and challenging opening night for the new music festivalSoundState, the Southbank Centre’s celebration of new music, crams a lot into five days, with programmes ranging across the globe and throughout the stylistic spectrum, from soft-centred minimalism to hard-edged complexity. Nearly all the Southbank’s resident ensembles are involved, and it was the London Philharmonic that got things under way, with five new or new-to-Europe orchestral works, expertly introduced by Marin Alsop.Three had been specially commissioned. Burr, by Arne Gieshoff, who emerged from the LPO’s young composers programme in 2014, proved an eventful concert-opener, with enough striking ideas – frantic, tangled orchestral tuttis ghostly, unsettling reflective moments – to justify a piece several times as long, while Anders Hillborg’s Sound Atlas was an expansive, five-part movement, predominantly slow and coloured by a glass harmonica, its string textures suggesting Vaughan Williams’s Tallis Fantasia with a helping of microtones.Helen Grime had composed a bespoke Percussion Concerto for Colin Currie. It certainly puts him through his paces in the expected way, with tuned percussion dominating the outer movements and the untuned instruments reserved for the central section, but it seemed rather formulaic.The biggest impression was left by the two works performed in the UK for the first time. Erkki-Sven Tüür’s 2017 Solastalgia used a solo piccolo (the LPO’s own Stewart McIlwham) to spark off confrontational ideas in the orchestra in what becomes an increasingly angry protest against climate change. And Louis Andriessen’s latest score, Agamemnon, first performed by the New York Philharmonic last October, is a rare orchestral work from a composer who has avoided such things for most of his career. With aggressively martial outer sections and a lyrical core of solos – especially for saxophone and oboe – it comes with a list of “dramatic personae”, though none of those Homeric characters is specifically identified in the music. At the very end, though, after the final savage chord, a woman arises from the orchestra (the LPO’s cor anglais player Sue Böhling here) to identify herself as Cassandra and speak a few lines of Aeschylus in Ted Hughes’s English version foretelling the fate of the protagonists in Andriessen’s musical drama."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4ee253dc087211769b160d35508e8564476ffed/1312_21_3136_1882/master/3136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd001213f9a7e63163f7910188cb27cb","title":"how a deluge of money nearly broke the premier league","story":"It’s the world’s most lucrative football league. But a civil war over all that money almost toppled itBy  Jonathan Clegg and  Joshua RobinsonThe Premier League offices in London’s West End are located mostly underground. This fact alone does not make them exceptional in the world of football administration – Fifa’s lair in Zurich features five subterranean levels, including a sinister conference room ripped straight out of Dr Strangelove. But the Premier League isn’t going for the futuristic bunker vibe. Nothing about it exudes Bond-villain hideout or military robotics lab. What makes the place remarkable is its modesty. Premier League HQ feels more like the offices of a mid-sized legal practice.Blending into a row of elegant Georgian buildings with white fronts and black railings, the exterior of the Premier League offices at 30 Gloucester Place is marked only by a small silver plaque. Where it publishes its address, the Premier League points out that access is “by appointment only”. The few people who ever stop to take pictures are the tabloid photographers working the pavement whenever the Premier League managers gather for their league-wide meetings – think photos of middle-aged men in ill-fitting suits emerging from black cabs.When the league moved into the space in 2005, domestic TV rights had just cleared the billion-pound mark for the second successive cycle. Ratings were through the roof. Yet for the most popular league on the planet, the offices have none of the ostentation or scale of, for instance, the NFL’s, perched high above the corner of 51st Street and Park Avenue in New York, or the NBA’s, which are in a skyscraper two avenues over. In part, that’s because the Premier League has roughly 10 times fewer employees than the NFL or NBA, with a head count hovering around 110.Visitors to the home of the world’s most popular league are led downstairs to a small waiting area where the sofas are pointed at the Premier League trophy and a tea station. The atmosphere is one of quiet, businesslike efficiency. Until his resignation this winter, the chief executive, Richard Scudamore, kept a spartan office here, as do the aides who make sure that contracts are up to date, partners are kept happy, and the league’s extensive charity operations tick over smoothly. Scudamore, the Premier League’s highest-paid executive, earned a basic salary in the low seven figures – news of the £5m “golden handshake” he received on his way out caused a brief furore in December. But compare that to the $34m that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell earned in 2016, or the roughly $20m the NBA is believed to pay commissioner Adam Silver, and you wonder why the Premier League – for all of the cash flooding into its clubs – makes its brass look so unassuming.The reason is that the Premier League is a much smaller sporting government than any of its US counterparts. It is first and foremost a media-rights-selling organisation that happens to provide 20 clubs with a platform, referees and a ball. The organisation has six league-wide sponsors – no more – in obvious categories such as official timekeeper and official snack, and a ball contract with Nike that has quietly hummed along since 2000. The NFL, by contrast, had 32 league-wide sponsors in 2015, including an official soup.The most profitable sporting organisation to come out of England isn’t in the business of peddling merchandise either. It won’t sell you a baseball cap or scarf – it leaves that entirely to the clubs. The Premier League’s website does not even have an shop. That’s why the whole operation can be happily contained in a single office that almost nobody knows is there. But ever since 2005, that humble residence at Gloucester Place has served as mission control for the Premier League’s quest for global domination.By the time Scudamore was introduced chief executive in 1999, he could tell the Premier League was already on its way to becoming a domestic juggernaut. Sky had renegotiated its contract for UK TV rights a couple of years earlier, agreeing to pay £670m over four years, more than doubling the value of its previous deal. When Scudamore looked at the international revenues, though, he saw a world of untapped potential. The league’s overseas broadcast rights had sold for just £98m in 1997, a figure Scudamore regarded not merely as disappointing but borderline disrespectful. In his mind, the Premier League was the most exciting football competition on the planet. It was time it got paid like it.His first order of business was overhauling the way the league sold itself abroad. Until then, it had auctioned off its overseas rights package en bloc for a fixed fee, with the winning bidder then free to unpackage those rights and resell them in different countries and territories as they saw fit. He wanted to cut out the middleman and negotiate with broadcasters himself. Scudamore was a man who liked to be in the room. He immediately told the club owners that they stood a better chance of finally raking in what they were worth by breaking up the overseas rights into separate territorial packages and dealing face-to-face with the TV companies. Convinced by his commercial background, the owners signed off on Scudamore’s proposal to become their ambassador to the world.Figures like those would have been inconceivable to the men who founded the Premier League in 1992. They had so underestimated the global appetite that, in the early years of their enterprise, they were the ones paying foreign broadcasters to carry their games, not the other way around. The clamour for rights packages from every corner of the planet now convinced them otherwise.As Scudamore gradually shaped his role into that of a globetrotting executive, making visits to key markets including India, Thailand, Singapore and the Middle East during each new season, he realised that the Premier League product was equipped with a host of built-in advantages. These factors, so obvious in retrospect, meant that fans around the world were predisposed to the Premier League even before they realised it. Best of all, those advantages were a total coincidence. The league had nothing to do with their existence.The first – and most forehead-slappingly simple – is that this whole show takes place in English. While Italy’s Serie A and Germany’s Bundesliga must first help viewers make sense of names like Sampdoria and Borussia Mönchengladbach, one-quarter of the world’s population can tune in to a Premier League and immediately understand what’s happening – even if it means occasionally wading into the absurdly tedious “soccer v football” debate. (For the record, soccer, like football, is an originally British term short for “association football”.) Beyond the language, the league also benefits from its location. As countless London firms have discovered, the fact that the British business day overlaps with both Asian and American daytime hours gave the league a leg up on rival sports organisations, including the NFL and the NBA.A Premier League match that kicks off in the early afternoon can be consumed both as primetime Saturday-night entertainment in Singapore and over a bowl of Cheerios on a Saturday morning in Brooklyn. On top of all of this, it was obvious to Scudamore that overseas viewers had a sort of natural Anglophilia – and were gravitating to the heritage and culture of English football, its authenticity. In short, they craved the Britishness of it all. “Being British is the essence of what we are,” Scudamore told the Times in 2013. “It’s a bit like being the Queen or the BBC.”By the end of his first decade as chief executive, Scudamore had parlayed that headstart into tenfold increase in the value of the league’s international TV rights. Now he had to add some creativity of his own. To keep global rights fees rising, it was no longer enough simply to cut out the middleman and deal with international broadcasters directly. He needed to sell them on the idea that the Premier League rights they had just paid through the nose for were indispensable to their business model. And to do that, Scudamore developed two clear strategies.The first relied on Scudamore’s own talents as a salesman – or, to be more specific, what one Premier League owner described as his talent for “creating tension” at the negotiating table, never letting buyers get too comfortable. If that gives the impression of Scudamore as a sales shark sniffing out weaknesses and exploiting them to push his product, the reality could not be more different. In fact, Scudamore created the most fiendish auction process in world sports by running the league’s sales department with the sort of folksy, homespun charm of a village post office.He purposely kept his sales team to roughly a half-dozen employees so that broadcasters felt a personal connection when they rang Gloucester Place. And the mantra they lived by was less “always be closing” and more “always be courteous”. Scudamore’s unshakeable sense of decorum taught him that politeness was the key to preserving customer relationships. At the end of every season, he personally emailed thank-you notes to the league’s 80 international broadcasters and sent special goodbye messages to those whose contracts with the league had expired. Scudamore also began to accompany the prime minister on trade missions, taking the Premier League trophy with him. “Everyone who sees the trophy will say, ‘Wow’, he explained. “Heads of state, prime ministers – they all want a photo with the trophy. It’s what we like to call soft power.”For two decades, Richard Scudamore’s professional life had been more or less smooth sailing. He promised the 20 owners of the Premier League that he would sell their game around the world, and for 20 years, that’s what he did. But after all of that peaceful coexistence between the clubs, during which English football’s biggest institutions had made money hand over fist, built towering new stadiums, attracted huge global fan bases and transformed themselves into billion-dollar businesses, the Premier League gravy train came to an unexpected standstill in 2018, just as Britain’s trains are wont to do.For the first time in a quarter of a century, it became apparent that England’s top flight – once a model of collective harmony and mutual benefit – was racked by ision of its own the Premier League had split into a morass of feuding factions that were each blaming somebody else for threatening to blow the whole thing up. The big six clubs wanted a larger slice of the pie. The other 14 felt left behind. And the original, 1992 formula for redistributing income – the very thing that underpinned the league’s wild growth – was being challenged.The simmering tensions were mostly kept behind closed doors, in club boardrooms, in executive boxes and in the conference rooms of swanky hotels. Outwardly, it appeared that the Premier League was a picture of strength. The league was resurgent on the European stage, qualifying a record five clubs for the Champions League’s last 16, while negotiations over the latest sale of domestic TV rights meant the clubs were in line for another windfall.But amid this outbreak of unseen hostility, there was one surprise. It turned out that the biggest agitator was the one club that seemingly had the least to worry about. Not content with laying waste to English football on the pitch, Manchester City and its Catalan-Emirati leadership were pushing to overturn the league’s way of doing business.In official league meetings and private discussions with other clubs, City railed against the league’s revenue-sharing model and repeatedly challenged the age-old Founder Members Agreement – a document handwritten in 1991 by Rick Parry, the first Premiership chief executive, that held the status of Premier League scripture. The reality is that when it was written up, no one paid much attention to the overseas income. In fact, the league was losing money on international broadcasts back then as it was paying foreign networks to carry its games. “Nobody envisaged that it would be as big as it is, so sharing those rights equally was a concession they thought wouldn’t matter,” Parry said.The way Manchester City saw it, the Founder Members Agreement was more like a relic that belonged in a glass case with acid-wash jeans, the Sega Mega Drive and other treasured artifacts of the 1990s. The league’s antique formula and its quaint, old-fashioned ideas about competitive balance had allowed the Premier League to become the richest purveyor of the world’s favourite sport. But for a club like Manchester City – whose modern history dated back to only 2008, when it was bought by the Emirati billionaire Sheikh Mansour – that was all in the distant past.In truth, no one should have been shocked to learn that City gave little thought to the overall strength of the league. The club’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, had telegraphed exactly those sentiments a decade earlier in his book about running Barcelona. Midway through a meditation on the differences between professional sport in the US and football in Europe, Soriano laid out his thoughts about the concept of competitive balance.If anything, Soriano’s conviction was even stronger now. The Premier League’s top clubs – like his – needed a greater share of the wealth if they were ever to hope of luring the world’s best players back to England.That much had been made clear to Soriano during the previous summer’s transfer window. It wasn’t that City lacked the funds to compete at the top end of the transfer market, of course. No team in world football spent more in 2017 than the £221.5m of Sheikh Mansour’s fortune that Soriano plunked down on five new recruits for Pep Guardiola’s squad. They weren’t the only big spenders in the Premier League either. In sum, English clubs splurged more than £1.4bn in transfer fees. That was all well and good. The issue for Soriano was that the summer’s headline moves for the best players and the biggest fees had not involved Manchester City. Nor had they involved Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool or any other English club for that matter. The juiciest transfer of the summer belonged to a different superpower in a different league controlled by a different Gulf state. Paris Saint-Germain, backed by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, blew a world-record €222m on the fleet- footed, flamboyantly coiffed Brazilian Neymar from Barcelona.If that wasn’t bad enough, just a few weeks later, the French teenager widely tipped to be the game’s next global superstar, an 18-year-old forward named Kylian Mbappé, had moved from Monaco for the second-highest transfer fee on record. He had signed for PSG, too.For Soriano, this was a galling development. It was one thing if English clubs had to defer to Real Madrid or Barcelona when it came to signing the game’s most prized players. The two Spanish superclubs had their domestic championships on lockdown, as did Bayern Munich. Players who signed there knew they could spend most of the season beating up on the weaklings that made up the rest of the league, allowing them to conserve energy for the occasional big game, the later rounds of the Champions League, and the serious business of lifting a big trophy above their heads.By contrast, English football was a grind. So Soriano couldn’t blame the likes of Messi and Ronaldo if they chose to spend their careers somewhere more comfortable. But there are only so many world-class players to go around. If Paris Saint-Germain were getting in on the act now, too, that was a problem. And in football, there’s only one surefire way to solve a problem. Soriano knew that if he threw enough money at them, the world’s best players could be persuaded to move to Manchester. Premier League clubs were making more than enough cash for him to do so he just needed to ensure a greater share of it flowed into Manchester City’s coffers at the expense of clubs at the wrong end of the table. It made perfect sense to him. If English football wanted to attract the world’s best players, then who could argue?When Manchester City reached the midpoint of the 201718 campaign with an insurmountable lead at the top of the table, it seemed that the rest of the season might turn into one long victory lap. But if that suggested a Premier League season devoid of suspense, the reality was far different. There was still intrigue, tension and drama out there. You just had to know where to look. For example, in the dining rooms of hip Manhattan restaurants. On a warm night in the middle of October 2017, an incongruous group of diners sat down to eat among the dark wood tables and black leather banquettes at Locanda Verde, a high-end Italian eatery in Tribeca.The group of old white guys with not much hair between them didn’t turn many heads amid the usual gaggle of well-tanned, well-Botoxed VIPs. But if anyone with a keen knowledge of English football executives had passed their table on the way to the toilet, they would have recognised that this party represented the most unlikely gathering of enemies since the heads of New York’s mafia families held their regular meetings in red-sauce joints to keep the peace. Around the table that night were Joel and Avram Glazer, the owners of Manchester Utd, along with the club’s chief executive, Ed Woodward Liverpool’s principal owner John W Henry and Ivan Gazidis, then the chief executive of Arsenal.That these clubs had ended up brushing off more than a century of mutual loathing to sit down to dinner together was due to an emerging crisis that concerned all of them. Over the previous 12 months, the Premier League’s “big six” had jointly reached the conclusion that the exorbitant sums the league were now raking in from the sale of overseas TV rights – currently worth £3.3bn – should no longer be distributed equally among the league’s 20 teams as they had been since the Premier League was first founded 25 years earlier.The way the big six saw it, some clubs deserved a larger share – specifically, them. After all, they were the ones responsible for the league’s explosive global popularity, weren’t they? They were the ones criss-crossing the planet every summer to raise the profile of English football, the ones who boasted of absurd global followings in the hundreds of millions, driving international viewership from Trondheim to Tierra del Fuego. It was only right that they should be compensated accordingly. Nobody in the US or Asia was wrenching themselves out of bed early or staying up late to watch bloody Bournemouth. Unfortunately for the big six, Bournemouth disagreed. So did the likes of Huddersfield, Brighton, Watford and the rest of the league’s smaller clubs. Which is why the executives around the table were slurping their pasta slightly more sombrely than the chef intended.John Henry, seated to the right of Joel Glazer, had come down from Boston to talk things through. Woodward and Gazidis, sitting opposite them, had been called to New York to add their input. But the group around the table knew that any hope of finding the 14 votes they would need to rip up the existing revenue-sharing agreement and draft a new one was all but doomed.Beyond that, the smaller clubs were united in opposition – and their resistance appeared to be a little stiffer than what the big six were used to steamrolling every Saturday afternoon. Within minutes of the topic being broached at the meeting earlier that month, it became obvious to the big six that they didn’t have a path to the 14-vote threshold. At least half of the league’s 20 clubs were not going to budge. The consensus was so strong that Scudamore didn’t even bother asking the clubs to go through the motions of a vote. There was no point. Instead, they had agreed to revisit the issue and try again three weeks later.But now, with seven days to go, the diners at Locanda Verde had to admit there had been no meaningful change. After years of attending Premier League meetings, Woodward and Gazidis had everyone’s voting tendencies memorised as if they were political pollsters. But when Woodward and Gazidis tallied up the two camps, even if every swing vote broke their way, they couldn’t make it work. The league was still gridlocked.Which left Henry, the Glazers and the rest of the big six owners backed into a corner. The Premier League’s revenue-sharing model, the two-thirds majority required for rule changes – these had been core tenets of the league ever since Rick Parry wrote them down on a sheet of Ernst \u0026amp Young notepaper 25 years before. They were the same tenets that had allowed English football to reach its position as the world’s pre-eminent league. But now, in downtown Manhattan, those pillars began to look as if they would have to come down. If the league’s top clubs couldn’t secure a more reasonable revenue split through peaceful means, what option did they have left? Nobody at the table uttered the words “European Super League”, but then, they didn’t need to.‘They threaten it all the time: ‘We’re going to break away,’” said one Premier League owner. “Sometimes they vaguely hint at it, sometimes they outwardly threaten it. But every time they want more money, it’s ‘Well, we’ll just go and play the big European teams.’” The spectre of a breakaway by the big six had been invoked so often during the previous decade that the Premier League now operated in a constant state of high alert, leaving even the most sober observers on edge. Which is how the Times ended up publishing a juicy front-page exclusive in March 2013 outlining secret plans for a Qatar-based “Dream Football League”, a new tournament to be played every two years and featuring 24 of Europe’s elite clubs, including Manchester United and a handful of other top Premier League teams. The DFL had the potential to “change the face of world football”, the Times story noted. Doubtless that would have been true but for one minor detail: the whole thing was a hoax dreamed up by a blogger on a satirical French website.The episode was embarrassing for Britain’s paper of record, but it got one thing right: the desire from forces inside the game to blow up the existing structures and reorganise around the most powerful clubs. In 2018, Fifa president Gianni Infantino was motivated to cook up a proposal for an expanded Club World Cup by an international consortium dangling more than $20bn. At the same time, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli was trying to convince his fellow superclubs to back a larger Champions League that would play on the weekends and shunt domestic league play into midweek.The big six were not shy about expressing their interest. So Scudamore responded the only way he could. Two weeks after the end of the season, he gathered the clubs again at the league’s annual general meeting in Yorkshire. Scudamore had begun to think of the year-long international rights debate as a boil that needed lancing. This time, nothing was off the table.The solution they agreed on distributed roughly one-third of all future international rights fees according to each club’s finishing position, meaning that the big six were almost certainly guaranteed a raise. To assuage the other 14 teams, they agreed that the ratio between the highest earner and the lowest earner’s payments would never exceed 1.8 to 1, a minor increase on the previous ratio of 1.6 to 1. The smaller clubs could tell themselves that the Premier League was still far more equitable than La Liga or Serie A. But as far as thebig six were concerned, they were finally on their way to righting a great injustice. In the interests of peace, the 20 clubs voted for it 18-2, and left Harrogate feeling relieved. But few gave much thought to the precedent they had just set. For the first time in 26 years, they had ratified a change to the Founder Members Agreement, the document that had governed the Premier League since its creation and provided the framework for its remarkable growth. It was as if they had taken a chisel to the Ten Commandments.Scudamore didn’t think the league would need to revisit the issue any time soon, but he wasn’t about to stick around to find out. Within hours of the Premier League’s announcement about the new revenue-sharing model, it followed up with a notice that Scudamore would step down by the end of the year.His battle to quell the big six was behind him. His UK television rights were sold – he had even brought Amazon into the fold by selling them the live streaming rights to a small package of games. And his international television rights were heading for another jackpot haul. It was time to punch out before the whole edifice started to wobble. “The stronger the Premier League is, the more successful the Premier League is, the more international rights go and generate, the more the TV deals go up, the less incentive there is for any of our clubs to go ‘Well, I’m going to leave the Premier League’,” Scudamore said. “The biggest antidote to chaos is a strong Premier League, for our clubs in England. And that’s the bottom line of it.”But he knew all too well that those outside forces would keep chipping away at the Premier League’s raison d’être, that those 20 businesses had less and less in common with one another, and that they might soon wonder why they were in business together at all. Whether those outside forces were investors from the Gulf trying to reshape the game, or even Fifa and Uefa redesigning the formats of club football hardly mattered. It was now clear that the most serious existential threat to the Premier League, itself formed by a breakaway in 1992, was, improbably, another breakaway.This is an edited extract from The Club: How the Premier League Became the Richest, Most Disruptive Business in Sport, by Jonathan Clegg \u0026amp Joshua Robinson, published by Hodder \u0026amp Stoughton and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ecd5387895d5c379a2b0037128832d6bdd6fcf9/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6daf115c8fab76cbfbb224493f6b9e36","title":"how brexit unravelled today in focus podcast","story":"In a disastrous week for Theresa May’s Brexit agreement, her former director of strategy, Chris Wilkins, and the ’s Daniel Boffey chart where it all went wrong.

Readers have been debating Brexit the morning after the prime minister survived a no confidence vote I think the prime minister just wants to do this “reaching out” as a PR exercise at the end of which she can announce “I tried, but no one else came up with another answer that respects the referendum... So you have accept my deal.”Her notorious rigidity is a major part of the problem. She fundamentally lacks the qualities to move this forward. Although she cannot be removed, she has to be circumvented to allow other options to be explored. SnagaThe purpose of May’s little speech last night was to play to the gallery of Daily Mail readers and to set the scene for blaming Brexit on the Labour Party. At a time when she needed to speak to the nation she was as isive as ever. GiantrobotThis is possibly the most abject failure of the British political system since the civil war. It’s the very definition of a constitutional crisis. The fact that Parliament can claim to have confidence in the government says that Parliament itself is broken. The citizens of the UK need a means of dissolving Parliament. helicanIt appears that May wants to have talks but doesn’t want to concede anything. Of course a second referendum should be on the table. The talks may conclude that it shouldn’t happen, but surely that is the whole point of talks.On Jeremy Corbyn’s refusal to meet unless she ruled out no deal, she said, “the door is always open.” Well, there’s no point having an open door if she doesn’t have an open mind. BellaTheCookCorbyn and the shadow cabinet absolutely right to insist the dangerous, flailing and failing May takes no deal off the table before they engage in any talks. May is totally responsible for this disaster and in the power of the DUP whose agenda cares nothing for the well being of the whole nation.The contempt with which May and the likes of Michael Gove talk of Corbyn is disgusting considering the harm created by Tories to our declining economy. They have made us the laughing stock of Europe. SissyJupe20May has no idea how to compromise and isn’t about to start now unless her hand is forced. The opposition parties should now unite behind Corbyn’s refusal to have a dialogue until no deal is taken off the table. At the very least they could extract from her a binding vote on it in the Commons.Ultimately though, we saw yesterday that the DUP can call time on her leadership whenever they want, so I assume they’ll be telling her what to do from now on. smazakIt’s time for Theresa May to abandon her red lines. Otherwise she’s merely trying to share blame. Without some gesture from her to indicate a willingness to actually change something, “nothing has changed”. PaulB1I don’t agree with Corbyn’s stance on Brexit but his insistence on Maybot taking “no deal” off the table is absolutely right. Impossible to talk while this vile dictatorial PM arrogantly refuses to listen to anyone except her rapidly shrinking team of sycophants. darquangeI am absolutely furious, that a bunch of self important, over privileged MPs are trying to strip young people of the same opportunities that I had. Its what you expect from the Tories who have always been the party of grumpy old men and busybodies who want to control everyone else. But what with Labour? SporadicWitIt’s beyond disingenuous to claim that Labour don’t have a plan. During the transition period, Labour want to remain in the customs union and the single market, abiding by the rules of both. Longer terms they seek to negotiate a new UK-EU customs union to avoid tariffs and prevent a hard border in Ireland. That seems like a sensible approach – maintain the status quo, but leave, allowing us time to transition slowly. We would be able to leave the customs union at any time, once we’ve begun the separation process. SharkcustardWell over 500 MPs want a no deal taken off the table. For the first time in this Brexit mess May should show good faith and stop the bullying. If she doesn’t then the short to medium problems will affect those with a bit of money dissatisfied with the increased hassle and cost of travel – and all of the other problems that come with a no deal. Those with no money will be worse off in the longer term. So many of her natural supporters will be immediately affected and they will punish her if her brinkmanship doesn’t work, as it’s only in her power to take a no deal off the table. jonniestewpot"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/936d5ae100f6e678b5cd75dec3690e267b6db62f/81_51_4614_2768/master/4614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=081d782f9bd217834033310785591226","title":"brexit second referendum amendment sarah wollaston conservatives mps","story":"Sarah Wollaston wants MPs to have vote on holding fresh poll when PM’s proposal is debatedMPs are expected to have the opportunity on 29 January to vote on whether to hold a second referendum, after a Conservative backbencher pledged to put down an amendment to Theresa May’s Brexit plan.Sarah Wollaston had previously withheld her amendment because Jeremy Corbyn would not support it, but she said it was time to put it to a vote of MPs when Brexit was next debated in the Commons, and called on the Labour leader to back her.Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, announced on Thursday that MPs would again debate Brexit for a full day on 29 January – eight days after the prime minister is due to spell out her next steps in a statement.MPs will be free to lay a string of amendments to May’s statement, in a debate that is likely to see a range of options put before the Commons for the first time, including Labour’s alternative plan and, almost certainly, an amendment opposing a no-deal Brexit.Any no-deal amendment would be expected to carry a majority in the Commons, after an amendment submitted by Yvette Cooper to the finance bill earlier this month was carried despite government opposition.Wollaston’s second referendum amendment, which could attract the support of a dozen rebel Tories, will not be able to pass the Commons unless the Labour leadership backs it.She said: “I think it’s really important that now we start to test this, and if we’re not successful the first time we could bring it back at a later stage.” The Tory MP indicated she was not certain of success at the first time of asking.Wollaston added: “I very much hope Labour will finish going through their process and Jeremy Corbyn will come out and stick to their commitment that he will back a second vote, which is what a majority of his members want.”The Labour leader shows no immediate sign of backing a second referendum, and on Thursday Corbyn said his party would submit its own Brexit amendment, calling for a customs union, a close relationship with the single market and enhanced protection for workers and consumer rights after leaving the EU.Wollaston was speaking at the end of the launch of a group of Conservatives supporting a second referendum, called Right to Vote, which was attended by half a dozen MPs including Philip Lee, Heidi Allen and Sam Gyimah.Lee said he believed that the second referendum faction in the Conservatives would gradually grow in strength, once other options have been exhausted. “We know cabinet ministers, junior ministers, backbenchers whose head and heart are over here,” the former minister said.The MP added that May had little room for manoeuvre in the latest round of cross-party talks, because the Tory party could split if she moved too far towards a centrist position.“The idea that we could enter the customs union and the ERG won’t explode, I don’t see it myself. The Norway model has the potential to split the party much more than a second referendum,” Lee added, although he accepted that “we may have to go through that process” of considering each in turn.The MP also complained that some backbenchers were refusing to come out in support of a second referendum because of fears of violence: “I know of one backbencher who would be here if he had not received a credible death threat” and added that a large number of colleagues were victims of similar threats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9c417c1974f968a151ee9a402401f442a461f61/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2be91702d2f3385a0198f7940702de1e","title":"how thursdays papers covered mays brexit vote aftermath","story":"The newspapers navigate the no-confidence motion, then the PM’s open door, then Jeremy Corbyn’s rejectionThe front pages all lead with Brexit news, and while all agree there is political chaos, they disagree about who is to blame: is it Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn or MPs in general? says: “May survives vote, but Britain remains in Brexit deadlock”, adding that despite surviving as PM and “weathering a dramatic no-confidence vote”, May “was left scrambling to strike a Brexit compromise” and Tory MPs remain “deeply ided about how May should adapt her deal”.The Financial Times: “May starts search for Brexit ideas after narrow confidence vote win”, which might be subtly suggesting it’s a bit late in the day to begin that search.

The paper blames Corbyn for the current impasse, saying: “Theresa May dramatically invited Jeremy Corbyn to Downing Street last night for emergency Brexit talks” but “the EU exit deadlock crisis deepened when the hard left Labour boss ducked the invitation”.The Mirror gives top billing to Corbyn’s response to May’s offer: “Ditch No Deal .. and then we’ll talk Brexit”. The Mirror paints a picture of the Labour leader in control, saying “Jeremy Corbyn last night snubbed Theresa May’s plea to help save her Brexit” after “the PM begged rival party leaders to join her for talks”.The Daily Mail paints things quite differently, saying “May wins confidence vote, invites Labour leader for Brexit talks at No 10, then .. wrecker Corbyn slams door on Theresa”. It accuses him of “playing party politics” after rejecting talks to break the deadlock.The Times also lays the blame for the lack of progress at the Labour leader’s feet with “Corbyn snubs Brexit talks”. Rather than saying the PM had “begged” the Labour leader to join in talks, as the Mirror does, the Times says “She appealed to opposition MPs to work with her on a revised deal ... The Labour leader resisted the overture, however, insisting that Mrs May abandon a no-deal exit before the start of any ‘positive talks’.”The i scoops up a variety of potential outcomes from this week’s failed Brexit vote, including a “Softer Brexit”, which is its headline, as well as cabinet resignations, a split Conservative party, and a new Scottish independence referendum. The Scottish papers are deeply unimpressed with the week’s events. The National says “the day after this useless government suffers a historic defeat, Corbyn can’t even lay a glove on a prime minister with no Brexit plan.” The paper says another referendum could be the answer: “Independence is only way out of this mess”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4a6dbc7ddb357861c9532be21c311e99070196a/560_6_2396_1437/master/2396.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53100fb02388cfd034ffa8710d5f2274","title":"more animal than ever europeans find joy in john bercow","story":"Continental press warms to Speaker’s style, hailing him as a solitary source of orderAs Europeans on the continent have watched the UK’s Brexit car crash, one figure offered some light relief to those new to the peculiarities of British politics.The often thunderous pronouncements of John Bercow, the verbose Speaker of the House of Commons, have become the subject of numerous profiles in newspapers, and a fair few highlights videos, shared heavily on social media.The Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant headlined its profile of the Speaker: “No one on the British island can call ‘order, order’ more beautifully than John Bercow.”The article went on to suggest “the only order in British politics comes from John Bercow’s mouth in these turbulent days”.“Louder, boisterous and, yes, more animal than ever, he shouts ‘order, order’, with which the 55-year-old House of Commons Speaker tries to calm down the members of the famous parliament.”An editorial in the Belgian newspaper Le Soir, which depicted the Brexit debate as a “black hole” – eating itself as it interminably chunters on – described Bercow as “impossible to live with, often unbearable, but irreplaceable”.The German TV news programme Tagesschau compiled a 58-second video for social media entitled Order! Order! Order! that evidently delighted thousands, with a string of amused comments posted below on Twitter and Facebook. “Monty Pythonesque. Glorious,” one viewer tweeted.While some attacked Bercow for allowing a vote that will force the prime minister to come to the Commons within three days of having her Brexit deal rejected, some well-known European media outlets took the opposite view. The row was enough for Radio France Internationale to name Bercow its “European of the week”.It is not known what Bercow, who even his admirers admit could not be described as publicity-shy, thinks of all the attention. In response to the criticism of his handling of MPs, Bercow, the Speaker since 2009, has been unapologetic.“I’m trying to do the right thing and make the right judgments”, he told MPs this week. “That is what I have tried to do and what I will go on doing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fde5ce098eff70ec54a468ef2e667d6aafb21aff/5_0_1863_1118/master/1863.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c5f00675725d501089b9388bc60e0f6","title":"introduced fun a and e staff","story":"Emergency departments are challenging places – but if we are to provide good patient care, we must look after ourselvesThe emergency department can be a solemn and challenging place: many of the patients we see are scared, vulnerable, upset or frustrated. Demand for the care and treatment we provide has also been rising. I have heard about the impact on colleagues and felt it myself – either in a moment’s frustration or despair during a busy shift, or by reading the research about high burnout rates in emergency medicine.In 2016, the NHS had a very challenging winter. More people were coming to A\u0026ampE, and they were sicker and needed more complex care. Working through this led me to ask two simple questions: are our jobs making us sick? And what can I do about it?I’ve been interested in the concept of wellness for some time – and in particular, how fun can contribute. I’ve done standup comedy workshops, creativity classes and laughter yoga I know that becoming absorbed in fun, creative tasks can work in a similar way to mindfulness. You focus on the present and give your mind a rest from worrying about the past and future. I also researched Volkswagen’s fun theory, which states that iniduals are more likely to change their behaviour if fun is involved. At the Whittington hospital in London, I started talking to my colleagues about how we could introduce some time into our day to focus on fun. In November 2017 we decided to dedicate one of our daily 10-minute learning sessions every week to doing something different – a simple improvisation or clapping game, a challenge to share a little-known fact about ourselves, or a contest between groups to turn themselves into a shape. We also dedicated some sessions to creative activities such as painting or origami.They are all exercises in focus, multitasking and connecting with others. The sessions proved extremely popular and staff started to feel the impact. In a busy emergency department, not everyone could attend at first. We were lucky enough to get support to run a short series of longer sessions over February and March last year, so that every member of staff had the opportunity to spend one day immersed in creativity and fun, learning skills that would help them become more resilient as iniduals and in the high-pressure environment of their work.But no measure can do justice to the atmosphere in the room. Giving staff just a small amount of time and space to be together and have fun was uplifting. There was a lot of laughter and everyone felt that they had been able to connect with each other in a different and more positive way.I was struck by how much talent and energy we have in our team. We frequently talk about making savings in the NHS but we must not lose focus on the natural resources of our staff. Seeing and acknowledging the whole person, their personality and talents, is a form of appreciation.Of course, we need to behave appropriately with the elderly man who has become confused, fallen and broken his hip with the woman having a mental health episode for whom we can provide a place of safety until she can get the specialist help she needs with the parent who is worried about their child who has had a fever for four days with the person who has been in a car accident. But if we are going to give the best possible service to our patients we must look after ourselves as well.Some may argue that ultimately it’s the system that needs fixing, and that staff-centred wellness programmes are a waste of time. However, systemic change takes a long time and is beyond the scope of iniduals or single organisations. Focusing on creating a positive and supportive environment lays the foundations for the energy and creativity needed for change led from the frontline – and means that we can maybe have a little fun along the way.If you would like to contribute to our Blood, sweat and tears series about experiences in healthcare, read our guidelines and get in touch by emailing sarah.johnson@the"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43487165058eea8fd78377c36735a242855e5f18/0_223_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9508c533cfca3c8d8c5dc89d748134e8","title":"dylan hartley left out england six nations squad ireland rugby union","story":"• Hartley will miss England’s opener against Ireland next month• Cowan-Dickie, Singleton, Thorley, Robson and Earl in squadDylan Hartley has been omitted from England’s Six Nations squad due to injury and will miss their opening fixture against Ireland next month.Hartley has not played for Northampton since 21 December because of a knee problem and Eddie Jones has revealed he will not travel to England’s training camp in Portugal next week as a result.In his place Luke Cowan-Dickie is included in a 35-man squad, as is Jack Singleton, who is one of four uncapped call-ups along with Ollie Thorley, Dan Robson and Ben Earl. There are also recalls for Jack Clifford and Ollie Devoto while Billy Vunipola, Mako Vunipola, Ellis Genge and Joe Launchbury all return having missed the autumn internationals through injury.There is no place for Chris Robshaw, who is listed as unavailable due injury, nor Danny Care who is not. Jonathan Joseph and Anthony Watson are also still out with injury but Joe Cokanasiga has recovered from a knee injury to take his place after winning his first two caps during the autumn. Mike Brown and Dan Cole are also included despite falling out of favour last year, as is Manu Tuilagi who is set for his first Six Nations appearance since 2016.In Hartley’s absence, Owen Farrell has been named as captain, as was the case during last summer’s tour of South Africa. Northampton have not put a time frame on Hartley’s return, with the director of rugby, Chris Boyd, describing the injury as a “grumbling knee” but Jones is hopeful the hooker does still play some part in England’s campaign.He said: “Unfortunately, Dylan won’t be available for the Ireland game so we won’t take him to Portugal but we are hopeful he will be back later in the Championship. Owen will be captain by himself and he will certainly have great support from a number of players.”The winger Thorley, 22, is rewarded for his fine season with Gloucester while Robson is now finally set for his first cap as one of just two scrum-halves in the squad. Earl has caught the eye in Saracens’ back row this season and also toured South Africa last summer while Singleton has been included by Jones before, as a non-playing member of the squad that travelled to Argentina in 2017.It is the returns of the Vunipola brothers as well as Launchbury and Cole, who has looked back to his best in recent weeks for Leicester, and the 223 caps worth of experience they bring that will please Jones most however as he prepares for the trip to Dublin on 2 February. “Ireland are the best side in the world. They are a very well coached and drilled side and have particular things they do well in the game.

However, her performance at the Montane Spine race was undoubtedly the best in her career as she beat all her male and female rivals in completing the course from the Edale in the Derbyshire Peak District to the Kirk Yetholm in the Scottish borders in 83 hours 12 minutes and 23 seconds.That time shattered the previous best of 95hrs 17mins set by Eoin Keith in 2016 as Paris became the first woman to win the race outright. The previous female race record was 109hrs 54mins set by Carol Morgan in 2017.After the race, in which runners carry their own kit throughout and rest only when essential, Paris admitted to having hallucinations in the later stages.“It is really tough,” admitted Paris after running along the full Pennine Way through the Peak District, Yorkshire Dales, North Pennines and over Hadrian’s Wall in Northumberland to the Cheviots. “Two thirds of the time it is dark and it is completely different from any race I’ve run before because it is non-stop. You have the whole challenge of when to sleep and that becomes very tactical, and then you’re sleep-deprived.“When I was on the final section I kept seeing animals appearing out of every rock and kept forgetting what I was doing – hallucinations. Every so often I’d come to with a start. On top of that it’s very cold and I was wearing all of my clothes by the time I finished.”Paris’s performance was hailed by Jo Pavey and British 2016 and 2017 marathon champion Aly Dixon, who tweeted: “I don’t understand why anyone would want to race 268 miles across the Pennine Way, in the winter. But I do know how enormous a woman winning the Spine Race overall and SMASHING the outright record is. It’s HUGE!!!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce9994cf968cd81ecb84dce5a5bf1c5fecb7bf23/0_171_4753_2852/master/4753.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0ac11e05c74b3bf5cd9449b5da20b5c","title":"concentration talent ireland english trailing europe","story":"Leinster – and the fast-rising Scottish sides – are packed full of internationals while Test players are spread more thinly across their Premiership and Top 14 rivalsThe Premiership goes into the final round of the European Champions Cup group stage this weekend hunting a first victory over an Irish province in this season’s tournament. Its clubs have three opportunities: Ulster travel to Leicester, Leinster are away to Wasps and, in the one contest that has an outcome for both teams, Exeter have to become the fourth team to topple Munster at Thomond Park in the competition.The Chiefs’ task is even more demanding because of the bonus point Munster secured at Gloucester last Friday. It means Exeter not only have to win but deny their opponents a bonus point, unless they score at least four tries. For all the impact they have made in the Premiership in recent seasons, reaching the last three finals, they have yet to find the formula in Europe where a gameplan based on retaining possession is more hazardous because of the extra latitude given to the defending side at the breakdown.Wasps are looking for their first group victory in a campaign that started with a resounding defeat in Dublin. Their director of rugby, Dai Young, believes English clubs start with a disadvantage against teams in Ireland and France because of the salary cap. He pointed out that Leinster, for instance, are able to replace internationals who are injured with Test players.“We do not,” said Young. “The Premiership is an attritional league and you pick up injuries. Leinster win in the Pro14 with half a team most of the time. Their top players feature in the derbies and Europe that’s it really. English players are probably asked to do a lot more. Everyone can see that is the way it is.”He has a point, but it was only three seasons ago that Wasps routed Leinster home and away. Saracens won back-to-back European Cups before Leinster toppled them last season and, for all their greater purchasing power, the Top 14 has supplied only one winner since 2010: Toulon. Newcastle were doubled by Edinburgh last month and both sides won in Toulon.The salary cap is less relevant than another numerical difference. There are 12 teams in the Premiership, never mind the desire to increase the number to 13 and close the door on relegation, compared with four Irish provinces. Talent is spread more thinly. Were Leinster one of 12, they would not be able to stockpile so much talent.Were England’s European contingent reduced to four, there would be a considerable hike in the salary cap, stronger squads and no league in which, as Bath’s director of rugby, Todd Blackadder, remarked last weekend, teams smash each other up so hard that they are almost too tired to have a proper crack at the European Cup.Which again overlooks Saracens who became the first team to qualify for this season’s quarter-finals when they subdued Lyon in France. The Premiership champions had 13 internationals in their starting line-up, most of them current with one of the few out of favour, Alex Goode, again excelling at full-back. He is one of a number of players whose club form has not persuaded the England head coach, Eddie Jones, to make them part of his plans. But with full-back one of the more marginal positions in his side, Mike Brown dislodged from the position but Elliot Daly yet to establish himself fully in the position in the absence of the injured Anthony Watson, Goode’s continued absence appears more a reflection of the way England are looking to play than him.Saracens hiccupped in Europe last season, losing home and away to Clermont Auvergne, who themselves failed to qualify for this season’s tournament, before falling to Leinster in Dublin. But they have shown in winning in Glasgow, Cardiff and Lyon in the last three months the ability to make crucial moments count. Most of the English contingent can dazzle but often end up blinding themselves.The Champions Cup is an unequal tournament in the sense that Scotland have only two teams who can qualify while Ireland and Wales have four. England have 12 and France 14, reflecting their far greater playing populations but meaning there is less concentration of their nation’s current squad in their sides.The system works for Ireland now, and Scotland with Edinburgh and Glasgow on the verge of making the last eight (Wales are struggling to keep up financially), but that does not mean that it always will. Ulster are making an impact in Europe again after an underwhelming few years and Munster are getting closer to where they were a decade ago after seasons of falling short.It is Leinster who are pre-eminent, the side Joe Schmidt left to join Ireland. They are making the most of their catchment area through their academy, a system that sees Ireland score over England where teams tend to be grouped in clusters: England, the Midlands and the West Country. Sale and Newcastle are exceptions, along with Exeter who have Devon and Cornwall to themselves.The Six Nations starts in just over a fortnight. Ireland’s encounter with England in Dublin looks the pick of the opening weekend but the three Anglo-Irish encounters this weekend are more self-contained than dress rehearsals. Exeter will not be given much more of a chance in Limerick than England will at the Aviva Stadium, but it is the opportunity they have been yearning for.Exeter are different from England, who took the power route in November, but a common denominator is Henry Slade, the playmaker whose importance for England has risen with the demotion of George Ford. For all the relentless grind of the modern game at the top and the incessant collisions, such players as Slade make a difference, as Leinster and Saracens have long appreciated.

Vegan Miranda Larbi shares her tips for creating an indulgent Veganuary feastThere really is nothing quite as wonderful as logging off at 5pm on a Friday knowing that you’ve got no plans or dates with anyone except your sofa and Netflix.Back in the day, you may have thought that anything short of spending Saturday with a banging hangover was an abject failure but, in these busy times of hyper-connectivity, having a little down time during peak socialising hours can be seen as the ultimate luxury.And it’s especially welcome if you’re taking part in Veganuary. After all, the best way to kick a habit is to simply not engage. So rather than dining out and being tempted by a plate of ribs or raclette, you’re much better off staying in with a truckload of vegan treats.For me, that tends to involve a three-course feast of simple but delicious goodies.First up, non-dairy cheese (just because you’re a vegan, it doesn’t mean you can’t still have a cheese-fest).Cicioni cheese is incredible. It’s made from cashews, almonds, salt and water and tastes like goat’s cheese. Slice some up, stick it on a plate of Kallo rice cakes with some spicy chutney on top and you’re golden.And if that’s not enough cheese for you, there are always more options.A classic wintry pass-the-elasticated-joggers dish is mac and cheese, and I have a vegan version that will send you into the most glorious of carb comas. My recipe is both delicious and nutritious. It’s rich in vitamin B12 (notoriously hard to get from a plant-based diet) and has good fats. Here’s what you’ll need …Mac and cheeseSoak your cashews for a couple of hours (I tend to leave them soaking when I go to work) and, once swollen, throw into your food processor along with a glug of olive oil, a pinch of salt, the lemon juice, garlic and a generous dose of the nutritional yeast. The more yeast, the stronger the cheese flavour.Next, cook your pasta.In a separate pan, fry your onion and garlic before adding your chopped chestnut mushrooms and kale. Give the mushrooms a chance to brown a little and then once they look done, add your torn-up spinach and mix into your drained pasta. Drench in the sauce and sprinkle extra yeast on top. If you have any of the Cicioni cheese left, crumble some over.Obviously it’s not an indulgent night in without pudding …Nothing beats a tub of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s to kick back with on a Friday night. Vegan Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is the only plant-based ice-cream I’ve tried that tastes as decadent as the dairy version – in fact, I don’t think I’d be able to tell the difference.Want to make it even more indulgent? Then I suggest throwing a packet of Livia’s Kitchen Nugglets Raw Cookie Dough into the mix (this is especially good with Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice-cream).Livia has some fantastically simple recipes (all vegan, gluten-free) on its website that are worth giving a go. I made an indulgent chocolate pie a couple of weekends ago, which was perfection personified with a dollop of ice-cream on top. I did have to lie down afterwards to deal with the sugar rush, but it was more than worth it.If you do Friday nights in right (more food, less boozing), you may even find that you’re curiously light on your feet and awake enough to make it to your 9am yoga class the next morning.See, Veganuary could be just the beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8bc71bface7ef6903bde9854f48c8988b922630/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f948dcdbaf8026e4e43892e7df17b71a","title":"theres never been a better time to be vegan","story":"With restaurants, chefs and well-known brands introducing more vegan options than ever, sticking to a plant-based diet is now both simple and indulgent, says Club Mexicana’s Meriel Armitage A decade ago, when I decided to go vegan for ethical reasons, the word “decadent” was one you’d never have used to describe the food available. More often than not, it fitted the joyless stereotype of lentils, quinoa and tofu, with the occasional Linda McCartney vegan sausage to liven things up. Now, though, ask a vegan what they ate last night and they’re likely to say anything from pizza topped with gooey melted “cheese” to crispy fried “chicken” or pulled jackfruit burritos. The vegan scene has truly exploded, introducing food that’s exciting, colourful and indulgent, whether you’re vegan or not.When I launched my pop-up, Club Mexicana, in 2012 I wanted to challenge the boringly virtuous chickpea and chia seed perception of veganism. Inspired by my travels in the US, where vegan food is innovative and delicious, I wanted to prove that being vegan doesn’t mean missing out.I realised the joy of Mexican food doesn’t stem from the meat, but the bold, punchy flavours created by salsas and pickles – the meat is just a carrier for those flavours. We try to be as creative as possible with our dishes, which include tacos with baja “tofish” – tofu fish – and roasted cornbread with pecan mole, smoked soya yoghurt, pickled pear and smoked tomato. When we first started holding supper clubs, a lot of people didn’t even notice the food was vegan, which is what I wanted.Over the past few years, vegan ingredients have evolved rapidly, which has helped vegan cooking to become as exciting as it is. Vegan cheese used to be terrible, but now you can buy everything from vegan blue cheese and camembert to cheddar and ricotta – all tasting as piquant and decadently creamy as the real thing. At Club Mexicana, we serve deep-fried “mozzarella” sticks made with coconut oil, which are crispy on the outside and oozingly melty in the middle.People also often wrongly assume that going vegan will mean depriving themselves of indulgent desserts and treats, but that’s no longer the case either. The naughtiest dish we offer is deep-fried ice-cream doused in chocolate sauce – it really doesn’t get more indulgent than that.More and more restaurants are offering innovative vegan menus. Supermarkets now stock an amazing range of vegan food that’s expanding all the time. Brands, such as Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s, are constantly bringing out new vegan products that are causing a buzz outside, as well as inside, the vegan world.There’s never been a better time to be vegan, or just to introduce more plant-based alternatives into your everyday diet. With so many amazing colours, textures and flavours on offer, you never need to feel you’re depriving yourself of the food you love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45c72d5042cf63ee2c720d714238911f247a7e26/0_373_5597_3358/master/5597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4b8aac52d5ac3a0c96c1d44a7f8009e","title":"the ultimate vegan baked alaska recipe","story":"This indulgent, retro dessert just got a vegan makeover, thanks to non-dairy ice-cream and aquafaba meringueServes 8Prep: 1 hour 20 minutes, plus 4-5 hours for freezingCook: 25-30 minutesFor the cake:125g dairy-free baking spread150ml dairy-free milk2 tsp white wine vinegar125g caster sugar1 tsp vanilla extract175g self-raising flour1 tsp baking powderFor the filling:500ml tub Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s non-dairy ice-cream3 tbsp jamFor the meringue:1 x 400g can chickpeas1⁄4 tsp xanthan gum1⁄4 tsp cream of tartar1 tsp vanilla extract100g caster sugarPreheat the oven to 180C (160C fan)gas 4.

It has offices around the world, including in London and Edinburgh, and often runs punchy news stories with an anti-west message.Facebook said it had removed 289 pages and 75 accounts believed to be involved in the Sputnik-run network, with activity dating as far back as 2013. Typical pages included one about fashion in Georgia and another about the weather in the breakaway republic of Abkhazia.One of the deleted Facebook pages was designed to appeal to Latvian food lovers. The page mainly featured pictures of gooey chocolate cakes lifted from Instagram, food recipe videos taken from BuzzFeed’s Tasty brand, and photographs of cats pulling funny faces, in an apparent bid to build up an audience interested in light-hearted content.The page would then occasionally post a link to a Sputnik news story on a topic such as the rising cost of food.The pages appeared designed to boost the reach of Sputnik news content, although it was unclear whether the motive was to find people who would not normally view the Russian news site, to increase Sputnik’s audience figures in order to make the news service look more successful, or a combination of the two.The hundreds of Facebook pages in the apparent Sputnik-run network had about 790,000 followers. This is larger than the combined total of the official Sputnik Facebook pages in the countries affected – but still substantially smaller than the main Sputnik English-language Facebook page.Many corporate brands pay Facebook pages run by influencers to post links to their content in a bid to increase reach. However, it is highly unusual for a news organisation to run such pages itself.Facebook has stepped up its efforts to remove pages engaging in what it calls “coordinated inauthentic behaviour” following the 2016 US election, which saw widespread meddling by Russia’s Internet Research Agency. It has also taken down pages believed to be run by the Iranian state, among others.Facebook separately said it had removed an unrelated network of 107 pages, groups and accounts, as well as 41 Instagram accounts, for engaging in coordinated inauthentic behaviour. It said the network originated in Russia and operated in Ukraine and was removed after a tip from the US authorities.“The iniduals behind these accounts primarily represented themselves as Ukrainian, and they operated a variety of fake accounts while sharing local Ukrainian news stories on a variety of topics, such as weather, protests, Nato and health conditions at schools,” the company said.Sputnik has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/109fcf57b710a980ba05a21fb1388c78737ecefe/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbe682ad61572a484ababaab179f83d4","title":"locals guide to palermo sicily capital of culture 2018 10 tips","story":"It may still be basking in the glow of being Italian Capital of Culture 2018 but the city has been a cultural melting pot since antiquityThe Sicilian capital, called the “Kingdom of the sun” by invading Normans in the 12th century, has been a cultural melting pot since Phoenicians and Greeks fought over it in the 5th and 6th centuries BC. Sitting close to where Europe ends and Africa begins, Palermo bears the scars – and echoes the glories – of centuries of domination. Once Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Norman and ultimately Italian – unified with the mainland only in 1861 – it has a relatively recent “made in Italy” identity. And in 2018 it basked under the banner of Italian Capital of Culture, hosting the prestigious Manifesta contemporary art biennale and helping regenerate its waterfront.Palermo is proud of its Arabic origins, going back to the 8th century, and its three main markets, Capo, Vucciria and Ballarò, are reminiscent of Arab souks. The abundance and variety of food, and their theatrical vendors, give Palermo’s markets a distinct attitude. Touring them can be a bit daunting, so try a street food tour with Streaty. The price includes a passaporto del mangione (glutton’s passport), a certificate awarded to those who manage to eat their way to the end of the tour. Rick Stein apparently did it. • Tours from €39, streatyAt the intersection of Via Maqueda and Corso Vittorio Emanuele is Piazza Vigliena, whose four baroque corners mark the centre of the historic quarter, locally known as Quattro Canti. Immediately south and east is grandiose Piazza Pretoria, also known as Piazza della Vergogna, the square of shame, for the thoroughly naked statues of nymphs, tritons and leaping river gods (senza veli, without veils) adorning the magnificent circular fountain in front of the Palazzo Pretorio (City Hall). In the streets around are stunning 12th-century churches, Arab-Norman Chiesa Santa Maria dell’ Ammiraglio, Chiesa Capitolare di San Cataldo with its distinct faded red domes, and the baroque 16th-century Chiesa di Santa Caterina.Start your visit to the city centre with a ritual stopover at a bar. My favourite is Antico Caffe’ Spinnato 1860, where I like to sit at an outdoor table for a granita al caffe con panna (shaved coffee ice with whipped cream) and watch Palermitani go by. The cannoli (tubes of cream-filled pastry) are also delicious. • Via Principe di BelMonte 107-115, spinnato.itNarrow Via Maqueda, built in 1600, is an artery connecting the north of the city to the south. As a young girl, I remember it being a noisy, car-congested place, but it has recently been pedestrianised, and makes the perfect place for a passeggiata any time of day. Take the time to walk and get lost along the narrow side streets. You will be amazed how many hidden palaces and churches lie among the remains of dilapidated buildings left to decay since being bombed in the second world war. Occasional liberty style (Italian art nouveau) shops are still standing. Pasticceria Costa (Via Maqueda 174), dating to 1700, does delicious marzipan patisserie, and the walls are decorated with frescos by Ernesto Basile, the artist who painted the Teatro Massimo opera house (see below).At the top of Via Maqueda, you cannot miss Teatro Massimo Vittorio Emanuele, the third largest opera house in Europe, after Paris and Vienna. After the unification of Italy in 1861, Filippo and Ernesto Basile spent 20 years building this architectural masterpiece in classic style using local stone and marble. Its location was chosen to mark the point where the ancient quarters and the new expanding city meet, symbolising the historical link between the two. Grab a refreshing granita al limone from one of the moped sellers on Piazza Verdi, then take a guided tour of the theatre, with its ornate gold and red auditorium and seven tiers of boxes rising to a splendid ceiling painted by Rocco Lentini (about 30 minutes, adult €8, child €5). Even better is the Roof Terrace Tour, with breathtaking views over Palermo (€20). • teatromassimo.itOff Quattro Canti lies Via Vittorio Emanuele with stalls and a street market and a vibrant atmosphere. If you’re hungry by now, it’s hard to resist the aroma of the traditional Palermitan deep-dish pizza, sfincione, from street vendor Salvatore. This will set you up for visiting the 12th-century cathedral, built at the height of the Norman domination, and Museo Riso, Sicily’s contemporary art gallery. If you have time, take in Angela Tripi’s terracotta workshop in the Castrone di Santa Ninfa courtyard. Her handmade terracotta cribs and nativity figures are exported all over the world.Turn left into the peaceful gardens of Villa Bonanno and on to Piazza Indipendenza and the 11-12th-century Palazzo dei Normanni – which, despite its name, was built by the Arabs well before the arrival of the Normans. Its Cappella Palatina is the highest artistic expression of Latin, Byzantine, and Arabic style, with gold, mosaics and marble covering every inch of its interior. • Adult €10, federicosecondo.orgThe Cala (marina) quarter of Palermo is seeing a slow food renaissance, pioneered by the Gagini Social Restaurant, in what was once the workshop of renowned 15th-century sculptor Antonio Gagini. Guests share large designer tables and embark on a slow food dining journey in a candlelit setting. It feels like the soul of renaissance art is still here. Gioacchino Gaglio is Gagini’s adventurous and talented chef. I love his linguine gambero: delicate shrimp pasta, parsley pesto and a garnish of traditional breadcrumbs. • From €50 a head, gaginirestaurant.itClose to the train station and metro is the recently opened B\u0026ampB Suite Del Ponte Normanno.

On Wednesday in Manchester, he told business leaders of his visions for a fairer and more prosperous America in the 21st century.He then travelled nearly 50 miles north to the small city of Laconia, the seat of a county where Donald Trump saw his most dominant victory in the state in 2016, to tour its downtown and visit an addiction treatment centre. In Laconia, Castro seemed most interested in learning about the challenges local business face and the ways the opioid crisis has ravaged this former mill town and other areas of New England.Perhaps Castro’s unconventional style of early campaigning – marked by his Puerto Rico visit and the lack of rallies in New Hampshire – can help raise his profile as he enters a crowded Democratic primary field filled with political superstars.Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren announced her exploratory committee on New Year’s Eve Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard announced that she would seek the presidency last week New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand threw her hat in the ring on Tuesday. Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, former vice-president Joe Biden, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and and former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke are all tipped as contenders.In New Hampshire, Castro got his first “official” taste of the campaign trail. “Here in New Hampshire, ya’ll take your politics as seriously as we take our barbecue in Texas,” he told the audience in Manchester, remarking on the state’s once every four years political fervour.For many in New Hampshire, the visit was the first introduction to Castro.As the candidate walked down a snow-piled Main Street in Laconia and dropped into local businesses, many did not seem to recognize him and instead appeared taken aback by the flock of cameras following him.Laconia resident and business owner Carlos Cardona, who was helping guide Castro through the city, told him not to worry when Obama first visited downtown Laconia in 2007, nobody knew who he was either.In Manchester, Castro sought to introduce voters to his political platforms. Among them: using his first executive order to recommit the US to the Paris Agreement, universal healthcare, universal pre-kindergarten, tuition-free colleges, reforming the criminal justice system, raising the minimum wage and finding affordable housing solutions.“It takes vision. My vision is that in the 21st century, America will be the smartest, healthiest, fairest and most prosperous nation on earth,” he told the crowd.Speaking to the , Castro laid out a foreign policy platform that involved repairing damaged alliances and moving away from the “erratic” decision-making of the Trump administration.“The number one thing I am going to do as president, at the beginning of my administration if I’m elected, is to repair the damaged relationships that this administration has caused around the world,” he said.Washington should forge new alliances, Castro said, particularly in Latin America. If citizens of those nations can feel safe in their home countries, he argued, it could help stem the flow of migrants arriving at the US’s southern border.On Syria, Castro said he supported withdrawing US troops, but in a “sensible way”.“What’s been missing from the president’s foreign policy has been a consistent and well thought out approach,” he said. “He has been very erratic. And that’s what needs to change in the next administration.”While Cardona, one of Castro’s guides through Laconia, said he hopes to welcome more Democratic candidates to the city and remains undecided, he appeared enthusiastic about Castro.“As a Latino myself, I think it’s important that we have a Latino standing up during this administration,” he said, adding that he considered Castro a “top tier” candidate.And if he does take the nomination, Castro believes he can beat Trump.“I believe that the Democratic nominee in 2020, whoever he or she is, will be able to win that election. Because I think more and more people are seeing that we’re falling short with this president, that America can do much better,” he said. “So I’m confident that if I’m the nominee, I can win in 2020.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fb3dce1cbad4c3d81687b5b58cc7b06f9b956f8/0_132_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=914599fa852cf654b7248df8c00c5ae4","title":"whats free i hope they budgeted how the shutdown affects a small rural town","story":"As federal workers in Jesup, Georgia, fret over the shutdown, many non-federal workers, for now, say the shutdown remains at a distance or not even heard of it at allA pile of menus sat, untouched, at a table filled with Jesup Federal Correctional Institution employees at Alec’s Sports Bar. A waitress, who wandered over occasionally to fill a round of water glasses lined with lemon wedges, seemed to intuitively know not to ask if anyone needs a soft drink or a plate of chicken fingers.“I’m not usually a water drinker,” Hannah Gariepy, a teacher – and eight year employee – of the federal prison pointed out, “But I was thinking, what’s free?” Her colleagues erupted in laughter, all of them agreeing. One has a salad in her car. Another ate before coming to the bar.Jesup in southern Georgia feels like an archetypical blueprint of a small American southern town, dotted with a Dollar Store and a Piggly Wiggly grocery store. Everyone knows everyone, the same few family names have shuffled in and out of local politics, and most days, its clean streets look deserted.But now this sense of desertion is different. For Jesup, like many other communities across America, is in the grip of a partial government shutdown affecting 800,000 American workers. And Jesup will feel the hit eventually as a large chunk of its economy relies on the federal prison – one of the town’s major employers.In one of the town’s bars, colleagues from the federal prison – which employs more than 300 people in Jesup and the surrounding Wayne county – fretted over cancelled doctors visits and now impossible requests from children to buy video games. These workers are all now working without pay.“We’re not rich,” someone said, as colleagues continued to join the group. But sometimes it seems they are alone in their ever-expanding worries as the now-longest ever shutdown grinds on.Yet non-federal workers in the town say they have yet to feel the full bite of their fellow citizens’ hardship.The town will feel it eventually, Melvina Barnes, a reintegration and re-entry officer at the prison who lives in Jesup concluded. “Before the shutdown, I ate out every day in Jesup,” she added, sitting across from Gariepy. Just yesterday, she spent $100 dollars on groceries. “The milk was six bucks,” she grimaced, admitting she has just $278 dollars left in her bank account.But so far, outside those directly impacted federal workers and their families, many in Jesup say the shutdown remains at a distance. Some have not even heard of it at all.Only one person has called in this morning, thinking if it went any longer he might be late on his water bill, Deal said. But we’ll work with him if they’ve been good paying customers, he added quickly. It’s the first phone call his office has received from a prison employee.A few blocks over, a sign in English, Spanish, German and Italian welcomes customers to Cafe Euro. Christian rock blasted over the speakers. A line formed for sugar-laden smoothies and frappes. One of the employees behind the counter said she hasn’t heard about the shutdown. I think it’s fine, she mused, because no one is talking about it. In Jesup, she said, that’s a big indicator if something is important or not.Other residents agreed. A cashier at the Piggly Wiggly did not know what the federal shutdown was exactly. Neither did an incoming shopper. Next door, at Surcheros, a Tex-Mex fast food restaurant many of the prison employees say they frequent, noticed a slow lunch rush on the first unpaid payday for the prison employees. Yera Moye, who is ringing up customers said she didn’t know exactly why. She also had not heard about the shutdown.The county administrator tried to put the implication of the shutdown in Wayne county’s perspective. “My county, if you look at it, is very rural,” Ed Jeffords explained, pointing to a map across from his desk. A lot of people leave the county for work daily, or sometimes, permanently. He suggests the economy has needed revitalizing for years. For example, he added: “My kids can’t afford the lifestyle we gave them without leaving town.” His son plans to move to Orlando.Just outside Jefords’ office, shuttered storefronts and near empty stores on the town’s main drag lay empty as the evidence of the flagging economy in Jesup – a trend that started long before the shutdown hit the town’s main employer. The same group of teens circle three blocks for two hours one afternoon. The Strand dinner-movie theatre, showing Aquaman, The Mule, and Vice, sees a few stragglers going in and out for tickets one afternoon.It’s a well known fact a few families in town own the majority of the wealth, Hank Tucker, a Senior Correctional Officer and the president of the prison employees union said. Right now, he and his colleagues spend their dwindling savings on gas money to make their commute to the prison. That can’t last, though.“In two weeks, federal employees won’t be able to afford to show up to work because they won’t be able to pay for the gas to drive there,” Tucker said.Detta Dyal, who owns Shear Designs around the corner from where the group has convened, attends to her lone customer. As she brushed out her clients’ blonde hair, she shrugged when talking about the shutdown. One of her employee’s husbands works at the prison, she says, but I’m sure she’s fine, she added.“I watch Fox News so I know about the shutdown,” she began, continuing: “I don’t know the impact on her but I’m sure she’s fine because I saw on the news people are getting extensions of mortgage payments and kids are getting free lunches.”The lack of understanding in the wider community hurts those workers laboring for free.“For the public to not know, to not care, to be so completely oblivious, to think we’re undeserving, that our very livelihoods, that our children that go to school with their children, that our family members that go to church with their families, are somehow less deserving for the service that we do is like a slap in the face,” Gariepy spat out, exhausted from the multiple 16 hour days she has worked in recent weeks, even during the shutdown.But she thinks her fellow citizens will notice their plight soon enough as the shutdown rolls on with little end in sight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04d3c4eda36c5ef0fc1ea0d232bb6aaabc6d12b4/0_0_3527_2115/master/3527.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=251b8b08dc156df923de0afe10a24ddd","title":"us russia inf treaty nuclear missile","story":"The US has rejected Moscow’s offer to inspect a new Russian missile suspected of violating a key cold-war era nuclear-weapons treaty, and warned that it would suspend observance of the agreement on 2 February, giving six-month notice of a complete withdrawal.The under-secretary of state for arms control and international security, Andrea Thompson, confirmed the US intention to withdraw from the treaty after a meeting with a Russian delegation in Geneva, which both sides described as a failure.Donald Trump took US allies by surprise when he announced his intention to leave the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty in October. The agreement led to the destruction of thousands of US and Soviet weapons, and has kept nuclear missiles out of Europe for three decades.The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, accused the US of intransigence, saying Moscow had offered to allow US experts inspect the suspect missile, which it insists does not infringe the limits laid down in the treaty.“However, US representatives arrived with a prepared position that was based on an ultimatum and centred on a demand for us to destroy this rocket, its launchers, and all related equipment under US supervision,” Lavrov said.Thompson noted that the US had been demanding Russian transparency over the missile for more than five years. She confirmed that the offer of inspections was not enough and that the US was demanding the destruction of the missile system, known as the 9M729.“We explained to our Russian counterparts specifically what they would need to do in order to return to compliance in a manner that we can confirm, verifiable destruction of the non-compliant system,” Thompson said.“To see the missile does not confirm that distance that missile can travel, and at the end of the day that’s the violation of the treaty,” Thompson said in a phone briefing for reporters. She said that there were currently no plans for a follow-up talks on the INF before the 2 February deadline laid down by the Trump administration, though US and Russian diplomats would be meeting, including at a summit of the Nato-Russian council next week.Thompson said that if Russia did not show willingness to comply with the treaty by the deadline, the US would suspend its own obligations, meaning that the US defense department could start research and development on missiles with ranges currently banned by the INF, from 500 to 5,500km.At the same time, she told reporters, the US would formally give notice of its withdrawal from the treaty, which could come into effect on 2 August.After that, there would be no restrictions on deployment of medium-range missiles in Europe or the Pacific.The Obama administration had complained to Russia about its new missile but had not threatened to leave the treaty. Diplomats said that Trump’s third national security adviser, John Bolton, persuaded him to withdraw, despite opposition from the state and defence departments, and from European allies.After a reported appeal from Germany’s Angela Merkel, the administration agreed to a two-month delay, to give a last chance for diplomacy to save the INF.Thompson confirmed that the Russian delegation in Geneva had raised their concerns about US missile defence launchers which Moscow says can be adapted to fire offensive missiles. She said that the US officials had repeated US insistence that the launchers were compliant with the INF, and provided documentary evidence.The Trump administration was criticised by former officials and arms control advocates for not pursuing the Russian offer of inspections.“We’ve spent years trying to get something – anything – out of the Russians on INF. The Russian offer of an exhibition of the 9M729 is not enough, but it is something,” Alexandra Bell, a former senior state department official who is now senior policy director at the Centre for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.“Perhaps it is a foundation on which to build. Not trying to take advantage of this opportunity is to leave diplomatic options on the table and that’s just foolish.”Daryl Kimball, the head of the Arms Control Association said: “If the INF is terminated on 2 August, there will be nothing to prevent Russia from deploying nuclear missiles that threaten Europe and the Trump administration will have no hesitation in pursuing the deployment of INF-prohibited weapons in Europe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90d4ded3aa7e4ac4ec7f043f20a2013007905258/0_61_4400_2640/master/4400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12c4ab19dd999790d631523ffef87af1","title":"france triggers 50m contingency plan in case of no deal brexit","story":"Five decrees to be issued within three weeks to authorise investment in border control checkpoints, roads and lorry parks at portsFrance has triggered a €50m contingency plan for a no-deal Brexit following parliament’s overwhelming rejection of Theresa May’s deal, the French prime minister, Edouard Philippe, has said.“What’s certain is that the scenario of a no-deal Brexit is less and less unlikely,” Philippe told reporters in Paris after a meeting with ministers on Thursday, adding that there were “strong fears” Britain would now leave without a deal on 29 March.“In such conditions, the government’s responsibility is to make sure the country is ready, that the interests of our citizens are preserved … That’s why ... I have decided to trigger the plan for a no-deal Brexit.”Five decrees will be issued “within the next three weeks” including authorisation for major investment in new infrastructure such as border control checkpoints, roads, lorry parks and warehouses at the ports and airports “most concerned” by the prospect of no deal, Philippe said.Authorities will also start hiring 600 extra government employees to deal with the consequences for cross-border trade of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, including customs, veterinary and other inspectors to carry out the necessary checks on goods, livestock and food products.“We want to be ready,” Philippe said. “This plan incorporates legislative and legal measures aiming to ensure … that the rights of both our fellow citizens and our businesses are effectively protected” if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.He added that France would also take steps to secure the interests of its fishing and fish-processing industries.The French parliament this week approved a law allowing the government to impose emergency measures by decree if necessary to cope with the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, including steps to “stabilise” travel, residence, work and welfare rights for British citizens in France, who would have 12 months to apply for permission to stay.A no deal Brexit would be “dramatic”, said Jean Bizet, chair of the French Senate’s European affairs committee, which on Tuesday heard from Gina Miller, the campaigner whose supreme court case forced the government to win parliament’s backing before it could trigger article 50, kickstarting the two-year Brexit process.Miller said she thought the most likely outcomes were a Norway-style, very soft Brexit or no deal. A “people’s vote” or second referendum was much less likely, she said.“It’s almost impossible to say and, despite the short length of time left, almost too early to say. But any outcome is now in the gift of MPs and from what I’m hearing only about a third back a people’s vote. So if you go by that we’re a long way off.”Miller said the main obstacle to a people’s vote were practical, organisational issues: “An extension of article 50 would not be enough, it would probably require revocation,” she said. “You’re talking nine to 11 months. It’s not realistic to expect the EU to go along with that” without revocation.Theresa May has left it “far too late” to start working on reaching a cross-party consensus on a form of Brexit that might be acceptable to parliament, she added, and a lot now rested on the Labour party’s response. “The Labour frontbench has to come off the fence and make a decisions,” Miller said.“It has to move to something. I think it could be Norway – it’s very hard for them to a Norway-plus relationship doesn’t satisfy their six tests. At the moment, I’d say we’re poised 50-50 between Norway and a no deal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26ad4d6a2232cdfc1932c798cb06edc4304e3751/378_455_3236_1941/master/3236.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=755227d44180092699595c655d3c3e37","title":"time to start talking about consent thailands nascent metoo moment","story":"A web project that let people share stories of sexual assault is growing into an influential force for changeIn a small bookshop in Suan Phlu, a lively district of Bangkok, an unusual conversation is taking place. Men and women crammed into the nooks and crannies between the books listen intently as Wipaphan Wongsawang picks up a microphone and gestures around her. “Women in Thailand should not have to be silent about rape and assault any longer,” she says. “It’s time people started talking about consent.”Wongsawang is the founder of Thaiconsent, a project that began as a series of articles explaining the concept of sexual consent to her friends. In the past 12 months it has grown into an online platform containing hundreds of stories of rape and assault, and inspired an exhibition of artworks designed to challenge Thailand’s culture of misunderstanding over sexual assault.“Before, in Thailand we never spoke about this concept of ‘consent’ in sex,” Wongsawang tells the . “And when it comes to news about assault, or rape, particularly rape by someone you know, the first questions that anyone asks the woman are: ‘How did you let this happen?’, ‘What were you wearing? or ‘Were you drinking?’ The first instinct is always to blame the women. And there’s a damaging assumption here by men in Thailand that if women don’t say anything, that means yes.”Activists agree that it is premature to call this Thailand’s #MeToo moment – there has been no naming and shaming of public figures, and the subject is only slowly filtering into public discourse. But the Thaiconsent project and recent hashtag #donttellmehowtodress, which went viral in Thailand this year, have revealed a desire to change the perceptions and handling of sexual assault.One of the first to speak out was Thararat Panya, a law student at Thailand’s Thammasat University, who last year posted an uncompromising account of her sexual assault by a fellow student on social media. Then in April, Thai model Cindy Sirinya Bishop began the popular #donttellmehowtodress hashtag after hearing that Thai authorities told women to “not dress sexy” to avoid sexual assault.“Our culture is not one that is so confrontational, and it’s going to be a while until a woman comes out and names names or points a finger in the media,” says Bishop. “But over the last few months, I’ve seen women in Thailand begin to collectively speak out, sharing their stories and pushing back on this victim-blaming which previously has gone completely unchecked here.”Panya agrees. “Society here really misunderstands sexual assault – everyone told me to keep quiet – and the justice system works against the victim,” she says. “But this year I’ve started to see a real change in attitudes.”Wongsawang experienced an attempted rape when she was 20 by a friend while at university. “At that time I didn’t understand what had happened to me,” she says. “So for a year I kept quiet, with this eating away at my heart.”But over the course of a year, the same thing happened to eight of her friends, who were all raped, harassed or sexually assaulted by people they knew but had no idea how to handle it or who to go to. Those who did report it were rarely taken seriously. “I kept thinking: was this normal in our society?” says Wongsawang. “Especially as our attackers would go on as normal, as if nothing wrong had happened.”For Wongsawang, learning about sexual consent was “like a light went on”. She began writing articles and, after graduating, opened the Thaiconsent Facebook page in late 2017. She encouraged people to share stories, anonymously, of incidents where they had been forced into sex without their consent, be it through violence or emotional coercion. The response was overwhelming.“People had never been given a platform like this to tell these stories before and feel like they were valid and not judged.” Over the course of this year, more than 400 stories have flooded in. Most have been from women, but three have been from men. Most had never taken their accounts to the authorities. It proved so successful, she now intends to make Thaiconsent into a formal organisation.There is still a long way to go. Both Bishop and Wongsawang railed against the way rape and assault were normalised in Thai popular culture, particularly in TV soap operas. It is so pervasive that since she began started #donttellmehowtodress and organised the Social Power Exhibition Against Sexual Assault, which will continue to tour Thailand in 2019, Bishop has had to turn down several TV roles that she felt compromised her activism.“The biggest problem I see in Thailand is the dangerous gap in conversations about sex, where men don’t ask what women want, they just take it,” says Wongsawang. “And for women, often they don’t dare to express what they want or don’t want. Thai women are taught to say yes – we are groomed to please others – and not empowered to say, ‘No, I don’t want this,’ especially to someone she knows. It’s these attitudes we want to change.”Navaon Siradapuvadol contributed to the reporting on this story"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"The first significant career choice you make will not necessarily be life-determiningRegister your details now \u0026ndash you can determine your final course preferences laterMany students receive financial help but preparation is key when it comes to securing the correct level of fundingAvoid the traps: Parents can offer vital support, but their knowledge is often outdatedWhat factors should you consider when deciding on what career path you wish to takeMultinational firms concerned over standard of foreign languages among school-leaversWe talk to graduates who made the wrong call when they filled out the CAO formTimeline for the 2019 college application processThousands to apply for courses ahead of this month\u0026rsquos application deadlineDownload PDFs of our comprehensive list of level 8 and level 67 courses"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"The board of Coombe Hospital overruled consultants\u0026rsquo decision, D\u0026aacuteil toldFianna F\u0026aacuteil politician for Ireland South topped the poll in the 2014 elections\u0026lsquoIf the driver slowed down just a little bit, I wouldn\u0026rsquot have lost my husband,\u0026rsquo widow saidIrish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association condemn Taoiseach\u0026rsquos comments on meatGarda checkpoints are \u0026lsquoover the top\u0026rsquo and akin to \u0026lsquopolice state\u0026rsquo, Cabinet member claimsAnti-bullying activist to address human resources Talent Summit in Conference CentreGeoffrey Shannon called for cybercrime and pornography agreements ratification in 2014Three minutes to explain a science concept to a jury and an audience \u0026ndash no slides allowedResearch Lives: Dr Deirdre Murray, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research and UCCGarda\u0026iacute say unlicensed middle men have erted \u0026euro23m away from insurance firmsSmart meters will help customers make better choices about their consumptionMotorists must apply a month before travelling under Irish insurance industry planIreland South MEP (54) likely to announce end of Brussels career on health groundsMinister for Transport\u0026rsquos Brexit remarks were \u0026lsquoas if he didn\u0026rsquot even read his own documents\u0026rsquoNew study also says the changes have widened gaps for disadvantaged pupilsTech giant has received removal requests from elected representatives and judiciaryGerman woman knits two lines each day in colours symbolising length of train delaysBrendan Smith is the second senior Fianna F\u0026aacuteil figure to declare his candidacy in a dayLess-well-off counties will see shortfalls made up, but rates will not rise with house pricesLimerick woman calls for change to concurrent sentencing for repeat sex offenders"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3661517.1539356993!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit explained why does the border matter and what is the backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A defaced ‘Welcome to Northern Ireland’ sign is displayed on the Border in Derry. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyWhy is the Irish Border such a big deal with Brexit? The 499-kilometre border running from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle will become the only land border between the UK and the European Union after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement brought peace to Northern Ireland and removed the need for border checks.It also established north-south rules and institutions that helped solidify the Peace Process. The border is currently invisible and neither side wants the return of infrastructure along the border or the creation of a hard border.So what exactly is a hard border? It is a frontier monitored and protected by customs officials and border inspectors, and potentially police or military personnel if there are security issues around the border.That could in turn lead to a police or military presence along the Border to protect check points. Customs and security posts along the Border were regular targets of republican paramilitaries during the 30-year Troubles.Why would there be a need for border checks? Different customs rules, regulations and standards will apply in Northern Ireland and the Republic if the UK is leaving the EU so the different rules could have to be enforced at a border.What do the EU and UK want along the Border? Neither party to the Brexit negotiations wants to see the return of a hard border but they cannot agree a plan on how to achieve this.So have they come up with anything to solve this problem? The EU and UK agreed in a political deal in December 2017 that a “backstop” was required in the withdrawal agreement – the orce deal – that would guarantee an invisible border in the event of no other solution to achieve this being found in a Brexit deal, either in a specific solution for Northern Ireland or in a broader EU-UK trade deal.The December 2017 agreement also aims to protect north-south cooperation, support the all-island economy and safeguards the 1998 Belfast Agreement. In March 2018 the two sides agreed that there had to be a legal text – not just a political declaration – around how this option would work in practice should no better option be found.What exactly is the backstop? It is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland.It would only be used as a last resort or the default option if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic.How have the backstop talks developed? Brussels believed a hard border could be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remains fully aligned with the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit.This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries,.Northern Ireland would stick to EU rules covering state aid and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier initially insisted that this backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland.London argued that if the backstop only applies to Northern Ireland, it would effectively create a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. The Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which keeps May’s minority Conservative government in power,\u0026nbspalso objected. They oppose any checks between Ireland and Britain and what they see as a border in the Irish Sea.So what finally appeared in the withdrawal agreement on the backstop? The UK government suggested a backstop that would keep the whole of the UK aligned with EU customs union \u0026nbspafter the post-Brexit transition period.\u0026nbsp The transition is\u0026nbspa standstill period when current EU economic rules continue to apply over the UK. Under the agreement it is due to\u0026nbspexpire\u0026nbspat the end of 2020 but it could be extended to 2022.\u0026nbspThe backstop would be triggered if the two sides\u0026nbspfail to agree\u0026nbspa new trade deal by that time\u0026nbspthat is far-reaching enough to avoid Irish border checks. Under the backstop, the North would also follow EU regulatory rules set down by the single market for goods. This would be enough to avoid a hard Irish Border, but would still involve some regulatory checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.But there are still problems?Yes, while the UK government signed off on the withdrawal agreement, Theresa May\u0026nbspfaced fierce opposition to it in the House of Commons and the backstop was one of the reasons why the House of Commons rejected the withdrawal agreement by 230 votes on January 15th, inflicting the heaviest parliamentary defeat ever on a British government. Many Conservatives fear that once the backstop is triggered, there will be no way out of it for the UK. The DUP objects to the fact that regulatory checks would be needed on goods crossing from Britain to the North and that the North would have to follow some rules set down in Brussels.\u0026nbspIs there a way around this? It is difficult. The EU has\u0026nbspgiven the UK assurances that it will make every effort to negotiate a new trade deal to make the backstop unnecessary, or – if it is introduced – to ensure that it is in force for as short a time as possible. However, crucially, the EU insists that the withdrawal agreement itself must remain untouched. This says that the backstop remains in place “unless and until” another way is found to avoid a hard Irish Border.\u0026nbsp Many Conservative MPs and the DUP are not satisfied by non-binding assurances, fearing that the legal withdrawal agreement is the key document.\u0026nbspWhat if\u0026nbspthere is no agreement?If there is no backstop, there will be no orce deal and no transition period. In other words, there would be a disorderly Brexit and the UK would crash out of the EU in March 2019. It is anyone’s guess how goods passing over the Irish Border would be treated in such a scenario but the UK’s chaotic departure from the EU could create all sorts of difficulties for cross-border trade and beyond. It is also \u0026nbspopen to the UK to ask for an extension of the Article 50 process – its departure date. The other 27 EU members would all have to agree. So far Theresa May has said she will not do this. She has also set her face against a second referendum vote.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Jeremy Corbyn under fire for refusing talks with Theresa May as PM seeks to break deadlockDeep Blue shark spotted off the coast of HawaiiExclusive: Philip Hammond tells business chiefs MPs will stop no-deal BrexitPhilip Hammond faces Cabinet backlash over no-deal Brexit as ministers say he is a \u0026#39rogue element\u0026#39What \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit really means, and how it would affect daily life in the UKBrexit: What\u0026#39s next now Theresa May has survived no-confidence vote?France triggers \u0026#39hard Brexit\u0026#39 plan and warns that no deal is \u0026#39less and less unlikely\u0026#39Feed the world: Experts call for vegetable-rich diet to boost health and end hunger Turkey deports Dutch journalist on suspicion of \u0026#39links to terrorism\u0026#39How popular is Donald Trump?

After levelling the land, acquiring superior seeds and changing planting techniques from a scattering style known as broadcasting to transplanting nursery-grown crops in neat rows, his output has increased by more than 50 per cent.“I’ve realised rice farming is a business,” he says.Rice is a staple food in Africa but supply falls far short of demand with yields in the sub-Saharan region among the lowest in the world. Pressure is mounting on local agriculture to feed rapidly growing populations and reduce reliance on expensive foreign rice.A worker at Labana rice millsIn Nigeria, the continent’s most populous country, productivity has increased but 55 per cent of demand is still met by imports. Government efforts to reach self-sufficiency and improve food security are contingent on the success of small-scale farmers like Sani, who account for more than 80 per cent of cultivation.But slow mechanisation, insufficient yields and poor quality rice – compounded by a weak market infrastructure – have left them unable to compete with consumer preferences for imported varieties.In the past, you risked “losing a tooth” on the stones in Nigerian rice but there’s a growing awareness that now it matches up to imported brands says Abubakar Abba Adamu, CEO of Labana, one of the largest rice mills in north-west Nigeria.Labana provides training and high quality seeds to thousands of farmers in Kebbi State then guarantees purchase of their harvest under the Competitive African Rice Initiative (CARI), a project that supports value chains in African rice farming.Farmers plant rice in rows using rope to space the seedlings“The mills feel their investment in rice is protected and farmers know they have a market,” explains Dr Kristina Spantig, project manager at CARI, which is implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, the German development agency.More than 90,000 Nigerian farmers have entered into contracts since 2013 and 81,165 have attended CARI’s Farmer Business School, learning to fill in cropping calendars, space seedlings with rope and irrigate fields during wet and dry seasons.Agents visit the fields with agriculture apps like RiceAdvice and WeedManager, which calculate fertiliser quantities and identify types of weed. At harvest time, farmers beat grain from the husks on metal drums to minimise breakage.“They are more and more ambitious,” says Adegoke Kazeem Adeniyi, CARI coordinator and value chain advisor at GIZ. The price of local rice is rising as the quality improves. “It’s no longer more attractive to buy imported rice,” he adds.  Rice farmer Umar Abu Bakr uses a portable pump to manage the water levels in his paddy fields in KebbiIn Suru Village, where residents are mainly farmers, Umar Abu Bakr has enrolled his daughters in school, finished the frontage of his house and fulfilled his religious obligations as a Muslim by going on the haj.Before he only produced enough rice for domestic use these days he has “peace of mind”, he says.  Since switching to transplanting he has upped his yield from around 30 bags of paddy (unmilled rice) to 75 per hectare.“I didn’t think it would work at first but then I saw the benefit.” Using a portable pump he lowers the water level in one of his fields. It makes the crops think they are dying and boosts growth, he explains.Most of the farmers in this community have shifted their focus to rice. Outside the heaving village grain store, new motorbikes are clustered beneath a tree. Young people are buying more as the wealth of the whole community increases, Abu Bakr says.Women dry parboiled rice in the sunMarket day here is the busiest in Kebbi State as trucks squeeze by to load up on fresh paddy for the mills, which supply wholesalers in the city of Lagos. Others come with camels or bikes to transport single sacks for local buyers.Just 20 minutes away in Jega Village, a group of women sieve and toss pots of paddy in the shade of a tree. This way of cleaning and preparing the grains is generations-old but a few simple adjustments have refined the process and reduced the time it takes from 24 hours to 14.“The new technology is easier for us,” says overseer Hadiza Adamo, 50. The paddy is washed several times then steamed rather than boiled, resulting in cleaner, tastier rice that fetches a higher price at market, earning the women up to 2,000 (£4.30) Naira profit per bag compared to less than 700₦ before.These days they don’t need to ferry the bags to market. “Now customers come to us,” Adamo says. Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Brexit latest news: Jeremy Corbyn under fire for refusing talks with Theresa May as PM seeks to break deadlockDeep Blue shark spotted off the coast of HawaiiExclusive: Philip Hammond tells business chiefs MPs will stop no-deal BrexitPhilip Hammond faces Cabinet backlash over no-deal Brexit as ministers say he is a \u0026#39rogue element\u0026#39What \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit really means, and how it would affect daily life in the UKBrexit: What\u0026#39s next now Theresa May has survived no-confidence vote?France triggers \u0026#39hard Brexit\u0026#39 plan and warns that no deal is \u0026#39less and less unlikely\u0026#39Feed the world: Experts call for vegetable-rich diet to boost health and end hunger Turkey deports Dutch journalist on suspicion of \u0026#39links to terrorism\u0026#39How popular is Donald Trump?

He has been hampered by injuries for almost two years but said he had wanted to continue competing for the sake of his loyal fan base.I was supported by so many people... I have nothing but gratitude, he told reporters on Wednesday.  Yokozuna Kisenosato wipes tears during his retirement press conference I was gradually recovering, but I was unable to wrestle in my own style, he added.His retirement from the sport leaves just two remaining wrestlers at the elite level, Hakuho Sho and Kakuryu Rikisaburo, both of whom are from Mongolia.The sport has been hit by falling numbers of Japanese competitors in recent years, in part because of the demanding lifestyle it requires as well as the rising popularity of sports such as football.Sumo wrestling | Six things to knowYoung sumo hopefuls train in tightly-knit stables - eating, sleeping and practising together and are sometimes subjected to harsh treatment in the belief that it will toughen them up.In 2007, one trainee died after he was allegedly beaten by his master and three other wrestlers after he attempted to flee his stable.The sport has seen a string of scandals in recent years, including allegations of abuse, drug-taking and sexism.Last year Harumafuji Kahei, a Mongolian yokozuna, resigned weeks after he was accused of assaulting a fellow wrestler. Kisenosato decided to retire after three straight losses at the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament in TokyoA new generation of female wrestlers are fighting to overturn ancient traditions around the sport which decree that only men can compete and women are seen as \u0027unclean\u0027.Kisenosato, who will be adopting the name of Araiso as a sumo elder, is expected to become a coach to budding wrestlers hoping for success. His decision to retire comes after he suffered eight successive losses, the worst run for a grand champion since the current competition format began in 1949.The champion made his professional debut in 2002, when he was just 16, and reached Japan\u0027s top ision, Makuuchi, at the age of 18. His elevation to the elite rank, which requires a tournament victory, did not come until 2017. The sport is struggling to recruit home-born talent in Japan He went on to win his first tournament as a yokozuna in 2018, but ever since his progress has been marred by a chest injury.The injury prevented him from playing in eight straight tournaments, the worst record of any grand champion. He returned to the elite level last September but a string of eight losses has led to him to withdraw from professional sumo wrestling.I was delighted when he became yokozuna but when you see him closely, you can tell that he was struggling a lot. These two years went like a flash, his stable master Tagonoura Oyakata said yesterday.He made a big decision. I can tell straight away by looking at his face that there were many thoughts on his mind.I personally cannot take it in.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Jeremy Corbyn under fire for refusing talks with Theresa May as PM seeks to break deadlockDeep Blue shark spotted off the coast of HawaiiExclusive: Philip Hammond tells business chiefs MPs will stop no-deal BrexitPhilip Hammond faces Cabinet backlash over no-deal Brexit as ministers say he is a \u0026#39rogue element\u0026#39What \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit really means, and how it would affect daily life in the UKBrexit: What\u0026#39s next now Theresa May has survived no-confidence vote?France triggers \u0026#39hard Brexit\u0026#39 plan and warns that no deal is \u0026#39less and less unlikely\u0026#39Feed the world: Experts call for vegetable-rich diet to boost health and end hunger Turkey deports Dutch journalist on suspicion of \u0026#39links to terrorism\u0026#39How popular is Donald Trump?

Despite the fact that inflation fell to a two-year low of 2.1 per cent in December, this is much higher than the Bank of England’s base interest rate of 0.75 per cent. Most banks fail to match the central bank’s rate with their easy access savings accounts, which offered an average of 0.23 per cent in 2018, according to figures compiled by Gatehouse Bank.The research shows that savers relying on easy access accounts would have suffered a real terms loss of £19 on deposits of £1,000, £37 on savings of £2,000, £94 on a lump sum of £5,000 and £468 on £25,000.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBased on an average nest egg of £26,403, using the most recent figures from Sun Life, inflation would have led to a loss of £494. Charles Haresnape, CEO of Gatehouse Bank, said: “Savings rates are slowly creeping up but inflation is still taking a huge bite out of savings held in easy access accounts. Millions of savers will undoubtedly have found that in 2018 they received a substantial negative ‘real’ return on their hard-earned savings, when the impact of inflation is taken in to account. UK inflation hits two-year low as petrol prices fallWhich banks have passed on the interest rate increase to customers?Rising interest rates will not yet lead to another financial crashSavers keeping their money in cash would have lost out to an greater degree - the average nest egg would have lost £554.\u0026nbsp“Those looking to drive a real increase in their savings need to be on the front foot in looking for better returns to prevent their nest eggs from shrinking. Many instant access savings rates are still at rock bottom and no one can afford to leave a significant amount of cash lying around for inflation to swoop on.“There are many more accounts savers should consider, from fixed-term to notice accounts, which offer greater returns and won’t leave them as vulnerable to the impact of inflation, like easy access rates.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile, savers were dealt a double blow as analysts said the latest inflation data indicated the BoE could take its time over raising interest rates. Meanwhile, Howard Archer of the EY Item Club said: “We would not rule out two interest rate hikes in 2019 but we believe one is more likely as significant uncertainties persist – with expected lower inflation easing pressure for more aggressive Bank of England action.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale.

PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. A live-action adaptation of\u0026nbspThe Hunchback of Notre Dame has been floated around for over 30 years, with the original attempt leading to the famous animated film. Another attempt led to an animated TV series on ABC.\u0026nbspHunchback joins the growing number of live-action Disney films currently being churned out by the studio, and will follow on from Cinderella, The Jungle Book, Beauty and the Beast, Dumbo, Aladdin, The Lion King, The Lady and the Tramp, Mulan, Pinoccio, and\u0026nbspThe Little Mermaid.The Hunchback of Notre DameThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.A second phase would involve a superconducting proton machine in the same tunnel, at a cost of about 15 billion euros more. That machine could start operation in the late 2050s.\u0026nbspThe concept paper, five years in the making, aimed to explore prospects of tantalizingly more powerful particle colliders that can inaugurate the post-LHC era in high-energy physics, CERN said on its website.Scientists discover new subatomic particle at Large Hadron ColliderUltimately, the FCC would include a superconducting proton accelerator ring with energy of up to 100 tera electron volts, compared with a maximum 17 TeV in the current collider.\u0026nbspCERN Director-General Fabiola Gianotti called the report a remarkable achievement that could help boost understanding of fundamental physics and advance technologies.\u0026nbspCERN said it was not possible to say exactly what benefits the new collider would bring to the world, but pointed out that the discovery of the electron in 1897 led to the electronics industry that now contributes $3 trillion annually to the world economy.The proposal came out of the European strategy for particle physics, which recommended that design and feasibility studies be conducted in order for Europe to be in a position to propose an ambitious post-LHC accelerator project at CERN by the time of the next strategy update.But the decision on whether to go ahead with the FCC - incurring an initial 9 billion euro ($10.25 billion) bill for participating governments plus a later 15 billion euro upgrade - is effectively part of an international race to host the LHC\u0027s successor, with China, Japan, the United States and Europe all interested.Any big machine for the future will be a global machine, said Arnaud Marsollier, head of media relations at CERN.No one expects to have two 100-km colliders built in the next 20 years, so if one is built in China, maybe Europe will do something else.The LHC is expected to keep running until around 2036-2040, by which time it will have done its job collecting data, but it might also be possible to upgrade it by increasing the energy of collisions, which would require major investment.China has floated plans for its own 100-km collider, but has not yet confirmed it will go ahead.Japan is expected to take a decision on a linear collider in March, which could play into a potential choice by European countries in 2020 about whether to back the FCC or another proposal for CERN, the Compact Linear Collider.For physicists, the location may be less important than the science opportunities on offered by a new collider, allowing them to peer into the debris left when subatomic particles smash together and shatter into even smaller pieces, some of which may answer fundamental questions about the universe.But science mega-projects attract talent and can generate unforeseen spin-offs - including the invention of the World Wide Web at CERN, which has become a global centre for physicists, despite the high cost of living around Geneva.The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 earned Peter Higgs and Francois Englert the 2013 Nobel prize. They had predicted half a century earlier that it would one day be discovered.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme.

Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager.

Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.“The Bargain Hunt cheating scandal was talked about everywhere, even Gogglebox. If anything, it made the show.

After winning, she\u0026nbspinvited other party leaders to meet her that evening to discuss a way forward – something Mr Corbyn refused.Details of Labour MPs’ plan to secure a new referendum\u0026nbspcomes as Mr Corbyn prepares to make a speech on his Brexit strategy in Hastings on Thursday, with his party’s actions now thrust into the limelight.Labour’s policy is that once Ms May’s plans have been voted down – as they were by a thumping majority on Tuesday – the party would seek a general election and then consider other options including campaigning for a new referendum.One senior backbencher told The Independent: “Now the motion of no confidence has failed, and we’re not getting an election, our demand is that the Labour leadership must move to back a People’s Vote by the end of the week.“If they go about just putting down motion of no confidence after motion of no confidence, that will make a mockery of our official policy.”They added: “Labour won’t get a People’s Vote unless we make one. If we just wait for Jeremy Corbyn we are never going to do it.”Labour won’t get a People’s Vote unless we make one.

Either he backs Brexit or he backs the people.“He has a responsibility to get off the fence and provide some effective opposition.”But a senior figure in Mr Corbyn’s team called on his party colleagues to be patient and argued that some of the discussion over a new referendum is being “manufactured” by those who dislike Mr Corbyn as leader.They said: “People need to wait and see what the leadership says. Moving towards a referendum is our policy as decided at conference, but people are attempting to impart motives for why that hasn’t happened yet that are not there. It’s just that we feel we need to go through various stages which our conference motion set out.“Two weeks ago people said we wouldn’t go for a no confidence motion because we were afraid, but we did. The next stage is how do we amend the motion on Monday.”He added: “At the end of the day we don’t have a majority and I don’t believe for one second there will be a People’s Vote at this stage because there is no majority, even if we were to put a three line whip on it. I think a lot of this is being manufactured, people putting down amendments now to whip things up because they don’t like Jeremy’s leadership.”Mr Corbyn will give a speech on Thursday which should flesh out his proposed view of how the country moves forward, but insiders steered The Independent away from the idea that he would back a new referendum.Ms May survived an attempt on Wednesday to oust her as prime minister, as MPs rejected Jeremy Corbyn’s motion of no confidence in the government by a margin of 325 to 306.Her 19-vote victory came less than 24 hours after the crushing defeat of her EU Withdrawal Agreement in the House of Commons, and clears the way for her to start cross-party talks on a Brexit plan B.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We want to see a Withdrawal Agreement that works for the whole of the United Kingdom and one that works for the European Union.The way to do that is to deal with the backstop.Full text of letter:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDear Prime Minister,\u0026nbspI am writing to follow up on my statement in the Commons last night on a point of order.\u0026nbspI wish to reiterate the points I raised at Prime Minister’s Questions and to formally set out the position of the Labour Party.We are firmly of the opinion that the starting point for any talks about how to break the Brexit deadlock must be that the threat of a disastrous ‘no deal’ outcome is ruled out.\u0026nbspThat is the position that Labour set out in our 2017 manifesto, at our 2018 party conference – and that we have consistently adhered to throughout.\u0026nbspI note that it is a position shared by all the opposition parties, including the DUP, and is the expressed will of Parliament. If you are serious about reaching a deal, then ‘no deal’ must be ruled out.\u0026nbspAfter the unprecedented and unnecessary delay to the meaningful vote last month, entering into talks while the clock continues to run down, and the threat of a chaotic ‘no deal’ increases, would be a reckless leap in the dark.\u0026nbspThe Chancellor and the Business Secretary were both open to ruling out ‘no deal’ in the recent conference call with business leaders.Therefore, on behalf of the Labour Party, I ask you to rule out ‘no deal’ and to immediately end the waste of hundreds of millions of pounds of public money preparing for a ‘no deal’ outcome. The £4.2 billion currently allocated to ‘no deal’ planning could significantly improve many of cash-starved public services on which people rely and could transform the lives of those struggling on Universal Credit.\u0026nbspLabour is open to meaningful discussions. But following the decisive rejection of the government’s deal by MPs on Tuesday, those cannot be on the basis of your existing red lines. It is clear that no tweaks or further assurances are going to win support for the government’s Brexit deal in Parliament.\u0026nbspWe have set out an alternative framework for a better deal: based upon a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union a strong Single Market deal and guarantees that there can be no race to the bottom on rights and standards. That is the consistent position that Labour has outlined over the past year.\u0026nbspI am disappointed that there have already been several briefings in which you continue to rule out a customs union. A new customs union is part of a solution favoured by most businesses and trade unions, and one that I believe could command a majority of the House of Commons.\u0026nbspI look forward to receiving your reply.\u0026nbspYours sincerely,Jeremy Corbyn MPLeader of the OppositionJeremy Corbyn MP, Leader of the Labour Party, has written to Theresa May\u0026nbspdemanding that “the starting point for any talks about how to break the Brexit deadlock must be that the threat of a disastrous ‘no deal’ outcome is ruled out.”In the letter Mr Corbyn states that “after the unprecedented and unnecessary delay to the meaningful vote last month, entering into talks while the clock continues to run down, and the threat of a chaotic ‘no deal’ increases, would be a reckless leap in the dark.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Corbyn repeated that all options remained on the table, including a second referendum, saying that given the severity of the crisis it would be wrong to rule any of them out.He outlined the party\u0027s desire for a\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal that included membership of a customs union, close links to the single market and worker rights protections.Those three elements provide the essential building blocks of a sensible deal with a clear potential to win majority support in Parliament and I believe such a deal would help to bring people together and overcome the isions in our country.But if the government remains intransigent, if support for Labour\u0027s alternative is blocked for party advantage and the country is facing the potential disaster of no-deal, our duty will then be to look at other options which we set out in our confidence motion, including that of a public vote.\u0026nbspMr Corbyn said that after Mrs May\u0027s defeat in Parliament on Tuesday, it was clear that her EU deal is now finished.There can be no question of tweaks or sweeteners from Brussels to bring it back to life, he said.The Prime Minister seems completely unable to grasp what has actually happened. She seems to be prepared to send the country hurtling towards a cliff edge.To get a deal that can command a majority in Parliament, Theresa May has to ditch the red lines and get serious about proposals for the future.A cohort of Conservative MPs left the Cabinet Office shortly after 11am including Owen Paterson, Theresa Villiers, David Davis, Steve Baker, Mark Francois and Iain Duncan Smith.They refused to answer questions from the press.\u0026nbspPlease allow a moment for the liveblog to loadThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That means that\u0026nbspif the UK is to hold another referendum, it will have to apply to extend the Article 50 deadline.\u0026nbspBut why does it take so long to hold a new referendum? Why did the Constitution Unit at UCL estimate that it would take six months? Surely the process could be speeded up in what is, after all, a national emergency?\u0026nbspThe short answer is that a lot of rules for the conduct of referendums were invented for the 2011 referendum on the voting system and for the 2016 EU referendum – the first national referendums since the 1975 vote to join the European Economic Community.Many of these rules are about allowing time for the independent Electoral Commission to consult people about the wording of the question, for parliament to scrutinise the legislation for the referendum, and finally for the referendum campaign itself.\u0026nbspBrexit humiliation is stark reminder of Britain’s waning influenceOf course it would be possible to shorten all the\u0026nbspperiods in which these things had to be done. After all, the Greeks managed to hold a referendum on the EU bailout in 2015 in just eight days. What was striking was how little controversy there was about that vote, even after the Greek government later accepted a bailout deal which in many respects was worse than the one rejected in the referendum.Compare that with the continuous dispute about the 2016 UK referendum, supposedly conducted to the highest possible democratic standards.\u0026nbspThe real problem, however, is that a new referendum in the UK today is a controversial idea and it would be hard to get the legislation needed to hold it through a hung parliament.\u0026nbspNormally, legislation has to be proposed by the government. It may be possible to force Theresa May into proposing a referendum, if the House of Commons voted for it\u0026nbspbut if the prime minister refused to do so, it might even be possible for parliament to change the\u0026nbsprules to allow a committee of MPs to propose a bill for a referendum.That is what lies behind recent headlines about the House of Commons “taking back control” of the parliamentary agenda from the government.\u0026nbspBut even if a bill for a referendum could be introduced, it would take time to get it through parliament because it would be so controversial. There would be arguments about the wording of the question, and every aspect of the rules. In a House of Commons where no party has a majority it would be hard to control the timetable.And that is before the bill even goes to the House of Lords, where the timetable is even more difficult to control, especially for legislation that was not contained in the governing party’s manifesto.\u0026nbspThat is the why it would be impossible to pass the bill before 29 March and why proponents of a second referendum will be looking for a postponement of the Brexit deadline.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

An exclusive survey for The Independent shows that a fresh vote received more support than any of the\u0026nbspfour other options put to the public, including allowing\u0026nbspthe prime minister to go back to Brussels\u0026nbspor a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit.The survey by poling organisation BMG Research also suggests that more people oppose\u0026nbspMs May’s deal than back it, although the prime minister can take some comfort in the data showing a softening of opposition.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

Failing this, a general election will be called.The last time a motion of no confidence successfully received the required support of MPs was in 1979 - by just one vote.

Despite the fact that inflation fell to a two-year low of 2.1 per cent in December, this is much higher than the Bank of England’s base interest rate of 0.75 per cent. Most banks fail to match the central bank’s rate with their easy access savings accounts, which offered an average of 0.23 per cent in 2018, according to figures compiled by Gatehouse Bank.The research shows that savers relying on easy access accounts would have suffered a real terms loss of £19 on deposits of £1,000, £37 on savings of £2,000, £94 on a lump sum of £5,000 and £468 on £25,000.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBased on an average nest egg of £26,403, using the most recent figures from Sun Life, inflation would have led to a loss of £494. Charles Haresnape, CEO of Gatehouse Bank, said: “Savings rates are slowly creeping up but inflation is still taking a huge bite out of savings held in easy access accounts. Millions of savers will undoubtedly have found that in 2018 they received a substantial negative ‘real’ return on their hard-earned savings, when the impact of inflation is taken in to account. UK inflation hits two-year low as petrol prices fallWhich banks have passed on the interest rate increase to customers?Rising interest rates will not yet lead to another financial crashSavers keeping their money in cash would have lost out to an greater degree - the average nest egg would have lost £554.\u0026nbsp“Those looking to drive a real increase in their savings need to be on the front foot in looking for better returns to prevent their nest eggs from shrinking. Many instant access savings rates are still at rock bottom and no one can afford to leave a significant amount of cash lying around for inflation to swoop on.“There are many more accounts savers should consider, from fixed-term to notice accounts, which offer greater returns and won’t leave them as vulnerable to the impact of inflation, like easy access rates.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile, savers were dealt a double blow as analysts said the latest inflation data indicated the BoE could take its time over raising interest rates. Meanwhile, Howard Archer of the EY Item Club said: “We would not rule out two interest rate hikes in 2019 but we believe one is more likely as significant uncertainties persist – with expected lower inflation easing pressure for more aggressive Bank of England action.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I have decided to trigger the plan for a no-deal Brexit.”He said the proposals would include money for airports and ports which are “most concerned” by the prospect of Britain’s withdrawal.Of course Jeremy Corbyn should talk to the prime ministerBrexit uncertainty blamed for worst housing market outlook in 20 yearsNo-deal Brexit could be ‘taken off the table’, Philip Hammond admitsLabour MPs bid to force Corbyn to back Final Say Brexit referendumAmong measures to be taken will be the hiring of 600 new staff, including customs officers and veterinary controllers, and preparing new parking areas and temporary buildings at ports.“We want to be ready so that the interests of our citizens can be preserved,” added Mr Philippe.The announcement follows the French parliament approving a special law earlier this week which allows for the government to impose emergency measures to deal with a no-deal Brexit.It comes after the country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, gave a scathing assesment of the UK’s approach to leaving the EU and hit out at politicians who had “lied” during the referendum campaign.Speaking at a town hall meeting in Normandy, he said: “It’s a referendum that has been manipulated, manipulated from outside by a lot of what we call fake news, where everything and anything was said and now they are being told, ‘Figure it out yourselves’.“Result: It is not true. We (the Leave campaign) have lied to the people and what they (the public) have chosen is not possible.“Good luck to the representatives of the nation who has to implement a thing which doesn’t exist and has to explain to the people: you have voted on a thing, we lied to you.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sri Lanka\u0027s Special Task Force members perform during their passing out parade in KalutaraCars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

So we basically try to put them into the system so they can get a proper welcome.”\u0026nbspThe solution is temporary and this is why we held this protest. We want the government to provide a proper hosting system for refugees with permanent housing, education, and work opportunities.The squat was one way in which they have tried to help newly arrived asylum seekers and refugees.\u0026nbspUntil two months ago, Barcelona’s “marginalised people” occupied the building, Maria says, but vacated it so asylum seekers could make use of it instead.\u0026nbspBut while the squat eviction has been temporarily suspended, the prospect\u0026nbsphas not been permanently banished. At a protest following the celebratory lunch, several hundred activists highlighted the limbo the squat’s residents now find themselves in.\u0026nbsp“For now, we are happy the eviction has been stopped, but we don´t know where they will go so we demand a permanent solution,” Maria added.“What can you do in the absence of state help? Just leave refugees on the street?\u0026nbsp“Every day we are receiving new people here. We are doing this, but it’s exhausting at the same time. And I think the officials are grateful for our work because it means they don’t have to do their job.”She says members of the\u0026nbspcity´s solidarity network met council officials, who agreed to send a mediation team to conduct a vulnerability report, leading a judge to halt the eviction.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sri Lanka\u0027s Special Task Force members perform during their passing out parade in KalutaraCars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

He initially sought asylum in Germany, which was “not so friendly,” so came to Barcelona two months ago after hearing it was more welcoming to refugees. He has lived at Casa Africa since.\u0026nbsp“Since I´ve been in Barcelona, I have seen a lot of friendly, nice and very welcoming people,” he said.\u0026nbspHousing for asylum seekers is abysmal – things need to change now“Many of them are also struggling and it´s not easy for them to help, so we really thank them a lot.“It is also not an easy life to be a refugee and I have met many people sleeping on the street. I was told that if I see someone in trouble like this, to bring them here. I have brought maybe four or five people here, to the squat at Casa Africa.”Zac said he was granted asylum seeker status a week ago but still does not have access to a social worker, which he needs in order to find accommodation, and a job.“My dream is to find work. If I don´t have a home, I cannot achieve this, but hopefully this will change.”Ignasi Calbó, manager of the city council’s “Barcelona, Refugee City” plan\u0026nbsp(Barcelona – Cuitat Refugi) said all asylum seekers at Casa Africa are enrolled onto language courses and have access to legal advice.\u0026nbspHe said the plan’s “Service Centre for Immigrants, Emigrants and Refugees”\u0026nbsp(SAIER)\u0026nbspwas launched in 2015 in response to the crisis. Its website states refugees and immigrants are provided with information on housing, legal aid, social care and on learning Catalan and Spanish.\u0026nbspMexico agrees to take in America’s asylum seekersBut Mr Calbó bemoaned the lack of central government support, which, he says, “creates unrealistic policies, provides no resources to help refugees and simply does not care for them.”He said the council is appreciative of the work of Barcelona’s community of activists for helping newly arrived refugees.\u0026nbsp“It’s good to see how people are working to help people who need it, but we are working with the community to find solutions,” he added.“They help us and we help them to achieve their goals, like we have done with postponing of this eviction.”He confirmed Casa Africa was not an isolated case of solidarity shown by locals to newcomers.\u0026nbspMr Calbó said some 7,000 refugees arrived in the city in 2018, up from around 4,000 in 2017 and nearer 2,000 in 2016.But he said programmes to integrate and host refugees are expensive.Those who have found shelter at Casa Africa must wait to hear whether they will be allowed to stay.However, for Zac, it has already proved\u0026nbsphow migrants need not be regarded with fear and suspicion, and can help benefit their adopted communities.“There is plenty of room for everyone,” he said. “People are just not given access to go and work and pay taxes. If they are given this, everything will be comfortable.\u0026nbsp“If you are working you must pay your taxes and that is what we want to do.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Once that case is resolved in February, we will launch proceedings against YouTube for their politically motivated censorship.”YouTube bans dangerous pranks and challenges after outcryBritain First, which grew quickly by using the power of social networking sites, has in recent months been banned from many of them. Last year, Facebook removed the group\u0027s page as well as those of its leaders, and similarly said that the accounts were being used to spread hate.A spokesperson for Facebook said at the time that it did not remove pages “just because some people don’t like them” and allowed controversial political opinions.“But political views can and should be expressed without hate,” a statement added.“There are times though when legitimate political speech crosses the line and becomes hate speech designed to stir up hatred against groups in our society.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here are the  dates for your diary.In  Easter falls on Sunday, April .Good Friday is, therefore, April , and the Easter Monday bank holiday is on April .The date is decided by a complex set of calculations based on observations of the moon.In early Christianity, dferent churches used dferent methods, leading to disagreements which remain unresolved centuries later.Eastern and Western churches continue to celebrate Easter according to dferent calendars, although sometimes by chance the festivals coincide.Easter celebrates the death and resurrection of Jesus, which the Bible says happened around the Jewish festival, Passover.Passover typically begins on the night of the first full moon after the spring equinox, except in leap months when it is the second full moon, as in .As the actual full moon can y in each time zone, the Church instead calculates Easter from the th day of the ecclesiastic lunar month, known as the paschal full moon.Easter Day is the Sunday that follows the paschal full moon falling on or after the equinox and is therefore between one and seven days later.According to the Department of Education, all schools will be off from April  to April .However, these dates may y from school to school so it is worth checking your local councils website.Schools usually get around two weeks off for the Easter break.Easter can be as early as March  or as late as April .In Western Christianity, Easter Sunday must always fall on the next full moon after spring equinox.The paschal full moon is the first one after the spring equinox, which is usually around March  or .The earliest Easter in recent years was March  in .It will not fall in March again until  when it is on March .In  a full moon fell on March , just before the equinox, so the paschal full moon was the next one on April .This was a Sunday so Easter was seven days later on April . It will not be this late again until . The latest recently was April  in the year .Christians in the East use the Julian calendar,  days behind the Gregorian calendar used in the West, so the full moon and equinox are calculated according to a dferent date.This means in  the Eastern church will celebrate Easter on April , a week after Western churches.Some years, such as in , ,  and , the two churches celebrate Easter on the same day.

Few believe him.Last year, he enraged EU chiefs, grabbing a key role as the European Commission’s Secretary-General by stealth and seizing control of the entire Brussels machine and its , staff.This puts him in pole position to succeed his boss, Jean-Claude Juncker who lurches into retirement this year as the commission’s supreme leader.Mrs May, steely-eyed and unflinching at home, has been the first to blink whenever the EU has set out its demands.Now she has infuriated fellow Tories by flirting with opportunistic Labour MPs and offering concessions to trade union dinosaurs such as Len McCluskey.“Her first loyalty has always been to the Conservative Party,” says a former ally.“Yet here she is presiding over its potential destruction.”The rebellion, led by Tory hypocrite Dominic Grieve, will reach its climax as Tory Remainers gang up with Labour and unSpeakable John Bercow to sabotage Brexit and block No Deal.A “secret” plan to hijack Commons procedure is being hatched by ex-minister Oliver Letwin, perhaps the silliest clever person in Westminster.It was Letwin who devised the disastrous poll tax, invited thieves into his house at am to “use his loo” and loot his property and casually dumped secret Cabinet papers in a Hyde Park litter bin.And it was Letwin, “the man in the custard-coloured corduroys”, who drove a stake through free speech in a am stitch-up with Labour and the Lib-Dems.Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith overheard the plotting in an MPs’ cloakroom, perhaps after being alerted by Letwin’s yelping giggle.He swtly leaked the scheme to frighten waverers into saving May’s deal.The rebel rabble have no idea what will happenthey succeed in killing it.A second referendum giving a clear choice between In and Out might well see an increased vote for Brexit.Any attempt to fiddle the question would trigger a dangerous backlash.An emergency election is for the birds. That leaves us with a No Deal Brexit on World Trade terms, which cannot be stopped without a change in the law before March .Forget about the Government’s Apocalypse Now propaganda. Germany is near recession, Italy is already there and France is joining the queue.Our economy is growing better than most and experts say it will accelerate, whichever way Brexit is resolved.For that silent -per-cent majority, a clean break still seems the right answer.SHOUTY Remainer Anna Soubry rightly complains about being labelled a “Nazi” by unsavoury protesters.Yet this publicity-hungry Tory MP is very free with her own insults, casually labelling as “racist” anyone who voted Out – surely a far nastier insult in modern Britain.Perhaps Ms Soubry should follow her own revolting advice . . . and “just suck it up”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now they want to cripple the Government entirely in a bid to secure a second referendum.Their outrageous plan to seize control of all Commons business would be nothing short of a coup.No wonder Theresa May admits the rebels are closer than ever to stopping Brexit entirely as her deal flounders.It’s time for the PM to listen to the Tory big beasts urging her toto Brussels this week and make it clear Britain is ready to leave without a deal.The plan has the support of her DUP allies, and could be her last chance to rescue her ided Government.Becausethe Conservatives don’t pull together, they risk the biggest disaster of all — a Jeremy Corbyn government.The cynical Marxist will do anything to get power — even though he STILL can’t tell us what his Brexit policy is.Yesterday Corbyn refused five times to say whether or not Labour actually wants to leave the EU at all.If Europhile Tories don’t stop their game-playing NOW, they’ll hand this hapless extremist the keys to No.IT beggars belief that the authorities still don’t know how to stop future drone attacks after the Gatwick debacle.Chris Grayling, the bungling Transport Secretary, claims Britain is a pioneer in the field — yet at the same time admits the technology needed to deal with the problem simply doesn’t exist.Surely the least they can do is crack down on the sale of drones in shops right next to airports.We can’t risk Britain grinding to a halt every time an idiot with a fancy toy decides to make mischief.IT’S nearly ten years since Jade Goody broke our hearts when she passed away after a brave cancer battle.In the wake of Jade’s ordeal, half a million more women took smear tests thanks to a Sun campaign.But now numbers have slumped — so we’ve started the #CheersForSmears initiative to encourage a new generation to get themselves checked out.Let’s make sure Jade’s tragic death wasn’t entirely in vain. The Strictly star is dating again aged  — with a toyboy  years her junior.Shirley Ballas has a new boyfriend whos  years her juniorLast week a French author claimed women over  are too old for romance.Fabulous figures like Shirley prove that’s total cobblers. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Maybe it will come after her defeat.TORY liar Dominic Grieve is setting fire to our Parliament and democracy.Here is a man who promised voters in  that the referendum verdict “must be respected” and any fears that Parliament would thwart it “were entirely misplaced”. He meant none of it.Parliament is not only plotting to thwart Brexit, Grieve is behind it.Always a rabid Remainer, he is the architect of a sickening ruse to strip the Government of power and halt Brexit.It is an act of naked contempt for .million ordinary people. An attempt by a sneering elite to nully their decision so the “right people” can get their way.They are saying: democracy is worthless. Your votes only countwe agree.Anyone in Cabinet backing this insanity should be fired. They would destroy Brexit and gt power to Corbyn.We have never seen any political act as dangerous.WHAT a surprise.

Even worse, it would deny us the right to walk away from these new arrangements without the EU’s say-so.May’s dodgy deal would reduce the UK to a vassal state, a bossed-about colonial outpost of the Brussels ­oligarchy. The people voted for Leave, yet May offers us Remain by another name, a deal that sells out Brexit.For the PM to so wilfully ignore the cry of her people is a sucker-punch to the most basic principles of democracy.But it gets worse. The MPs who plan to revolt against May’s deal in the ­Commons today will not do so to protect Brexit.They are not taking a stand against May’s deal to defend what .million of us — the largest bloc in British ­electoral history — voted for in June : A clean exit from the EU.No. They see taking down May’s deal as the first step to taking down Brexit itself.Whether it’s Europhile Tories or Labour, SNP and Lib Dem MPs who have long loathed the idea of Brexit, an army of parliamentarians plan to knock down May’s deal so they can set about knocking down Brexit.So the real ide in ­Parliament today is over how to stop Brexit.The main thing our MPs will disagree on today is whether Brexit should be killed off by May’s shady deal, by extending the Article  process or even with a second referendum, as anti-May MPs would prefer.Think about this. Think about what it says about the state of British politics.The people vote in historic numbers to leave the EU. Yet the political class plot and conspire to make sure we do not.It is hard to think of another time in living memory when politicians have been so ­spectacularly out of touch with public sentiment — and so ­sinisterly cavalier about overriding our democratic wishes.There are honourable exceptions, of course. From Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg in the Tory camp to Kate Hoey on the Labour benches, some MPs will opposeMay’s deal precisely because they believe in Brexit and plan to carry on fighting for it.But a majority of MPs fall into one of the two Brexit-phobic camps — whether it’s May’s “Remain by another name” or those who would stop Brexit entirely.Some MPs are terryingly upfront about their distaste for the democratic process and their disgust with us, the pesky ­electorate.In an unhinged online rant, Labour MP Clive Lewis branded Brexit a “racist endeavour” and said “we need to end it, now”. Let’s be real about what this means.Ending Brexit means overturning the largest vote in British history. It means ending the right of ordinary people to have a say in Britain’s future. When MPs like Lewis scream, “Stop Brexit!”, they are really saying: “Stop democracy!”Labour’s David Lammy is also open about his desire to overthrow the largest act of democracy in our history.He described the vote for Brexit as “madness” and says MPs must “bring this nightmare to an end”. By “this nightmare”, he means the ­public’s reasoned, ­democratic request to leave the EU.This is the depth of the ­contempt some MPs now feel for ordinary people. They see our political beliefs as a “nightmare”.On the Tory side, people such as Anna Soubry have not been shy about their hatred for Brexit. On Sunday Ms Soubry posted a chilling message on Twitter.She said Parliament has “historic” business to take care of this week and reminded everyone that under Section  of the Public Order Act, it is an “arrestable offencea person uses ­threatening or abusive words”.In essence, she is warning the masses to stay away from Parliament, to not even think about protesting.It is testament to the arrogance of the political elite that they can openly call for the overthrow of Brexit and warn the little people they might be arrestedthey get too angry about this blatant assault on our democratic rights.“Know your place, plebs.” That is what they are saying.The extent to which Parliament is ­conspiring against the people can be seen in Speaker John Bercow’s ripping-up of parliamentary rules.Last week, Bercow let MPs vote on an amendment to a motion put ­forward by Tory arch-Remainer Dominic Grieve.The amendment, voted through by  MPs to , would force the ­Government to come up with a Plan B within three daysMay’s deal is defeated in the Commons.It should be noted here that Grieve has changed his tune.In his election message to constituents in May  he declared: “The decision of the electorate in the referendum must be respected and that I should support a ­reasoned process to give effect to it.”Now he is saying it is “the biggest ­mistake of our recent history”.As one commentator astutely put it ­yesterday: “It’s precisely this sort of ­sophistry that ­created the backlash that led to Brexit in the first place.”The BBC has stated that Grieve’s ­amendment means MPs who are “plotting” against Brexit would have “more space in which to work”. Thanks to Bercow’s unprecedented move, backbenchers will have much greater ­leeway to hamper and even kill off Brexit.It is believed anti-Brexit backbenchers are planning to table an amendment that would give their motions priority over Government motions.This would not just dramatically change how Parliament has always operated — it would let backbenchers scupper a No Deal Brexit, perhaps even force through a second ­referendum.Some are referring to this as a coup — an attempt by certain MPs to take back control from the Government and also from us, the public.As one senior Government figure said: “This could be ‘game over’ for Brexit.”Democracy is hanging by a thread in this country.Last year, MPs celebrated the th anniversary of women and working-class men getting the vote. This year, they are using their clout to overthrow ­something millions voted for.The hypocrisy is staggering.In today’s battle between MPs who back May’s Brexit betrayal and MPs who want to go even further in ending the “nightmare” of Brexit, there will be one clear loser . . . democracy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To allow Brussels,it wanted, to keep us bound hand and foot forever in the Irish backstop, unable to forge our own independent trading policy.It would rapidly have become clear to the Leave majority that their decision, while nominally honoured, had been sold down the river. That we had not truly left the EU and maybe never would.More practically it all but guaranteed the collapse of the minority Tory Government since,it had somehow passed, the DUP would have withdrawn their support.The Government was always going to lose heavily. The discredited Commons speaker John Bercow ensured it by refusing to select any amendments to the Bill that might have helped narrow the margin of defeat.It was another low for a man who has already brought disgrace to his historic office by abusing his powers to help engineer the destruction of Brexit. Parliament will be a better place without him.But let’s not pretend it would have made much dference. The deal was fatally flawed.Mrs May’s response to the vote last night was feisty — challenging Parliament to find a viable alternative that could win a majority and honour the ­referendum. No one has a clue what that would be.And her call for MPs to “listen to the British people” was dead right.Outside Westminster, the public just wants Brexit done. They are aghast at the political games.The Sun reluctantly believes we must head for a clean break, finalise preparations as best we can and batten down the hatches.We never wanted a No Deal. It would mean a tough and probably damaging few months. But it would be the only solution left which defends what should now be paramount and most precious to us all: Our democracy — and the public’s faith in it.None of the alternatives does that.  They neither honour the referendum, nor are possible to sustain.They are all damaging in their own way. Yet our Remainer-dominated Parliament will fight tooth and nail to secure one of them and thwart a clean break, in direct conflict with millions of voters.The Norway-Plus proposal, however its champions spin it, is EU membership without the voting rights. No independent trade ­policy. No end to free movement.It is a short-term Remainers’ Brexit which would lead to only one ­conclusion: A new and irresistible clamour to exit properly.Another Tory idea is to lure Labour support by offering the permanent customs union they want with the EU, abandoning all thoughts of independent trade. It is a potentially suicidal idea which could destroy their Party and put Corbyn’s Marxists in power.Then there’s the toxic second referendum which would upend our democracy, shatter trust in politicians for all time and burst fully open our national isions.Its only upside is that Leave would probably win again. Plenty of the more sensible Remainers have seen through the EU now — and dislike the blatant unfairness of overriding a democratic mandate before it has been enacted.But what would the question be  Remain versus a deal already now rejected by a monstrous Commons majority as bad for Britain And whatRemain DID win  It is staggeringly naive to imagine that would settle it. Why should Leavers accept it  The wounds would never heal.Labour appears almost ready now to buckle to its europhile members and back that second vote — and its betrayal of millions of left-leaning Leave voters will finally be complete.Shadow Cabinet ministers are already teeing it up, laughably attempting to deflect blame by claiming Tory failure gives them no option. Don’t believe a word.The Tories have dedicated nearly three years trying to see Brexit through while Labour have tried to thwart every effort and their Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer has secretly lobbied relentlessly for a ​new referendum. Labour will own every ounce of the betrayal their working-class voters will feel — and will richly deserve the ballot box backlash.Mrs May has had the hardest task of any Prime Minister since Winston Churchill, trying to fulfil the Brexit mandate with no majority in a Parliament stuffed with Remainers, some colluding with the EU to sabotage her position.Even so, her handling of it has been a woeful failure.She is clinging to power by her fingernails. And only a fool would predict now what happens  to her, her Government, Brexit or Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Disgracefully, this attempt is being led by the Gloomster of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond.This is just another version of ’s Project Fear that was launched by the Treasury to try to persuade us against voting for Brexit by prophesying disasterwe did. Some prophecy that turned out to be! Project Fear Mark II is just as ridiculous.That said, Brexit has always been primarily about politics, rather than economics. The strongest argument for it is quite simply that we should be free to make our own decisions. But there is a connection with economics, because freedom includes being able to make decisions about economic matters.Moreover,people could be persuaded that re-establishing self-government for our country would carry a heavy cost that would hit them in the pocket, many might be dissuaded from supporting it.But it would NOT carry a heavy cost. Quite the opposite. It would bring large gains.Listening to the Remainers who dominate the BBC’s coverage, you might easily believe that the EU is a raging economic success. It isn’t. Yes, it was a relative success when we joined it in . But over recent decades the EU’s relative economic performance has been poor.The reason is clear: The EU makes bad decisions, including about economic matters, because its institutions don’t work very well and it is pursuing a political project, namely the establishment of a federal state. In the process, it is pushing barmy policies of harmonisation and integration and it engages in excessive regulation. The euro is the worst of the EU’s blunders — so far. But you can be sure that there will be more.Nowhere  are countries pursuing anything like the EU’s mad agenda — no single markets, no monetary unions and no federal super-states. Unlike so many members of our elite, other countries’ leaders have noticed that the EU doesn’t work.So why are so many clever and decent people among our leaders apparently still keen that Britain should stay in the EU  There are two reasons. First, many of them simply don’t know the facts about economic performance and don’t understand economics anyway.People with little experience of business who are steeped in the world of politics or the civil service naturally tend to assume that prosperity flows from the pens of those who sign agreements. People like them. But it doesn’t. It derives quite simply from the efforts of millions of men and women and of the businesses that employ them.Yes, trade deals can be good, but you do not need them in order to trade. Currently we do not have a trade deal with the United States. Yet the US is our biggest single trading partner. Go figure!Second, many among our governing elite do not like nation states. And they particularly don’t like ours. By contrast, they have a touching faith in the EU’s ability to suppress the uglier sides of nationalism while keeping the peace and pursuing an agenda of good government for all. Doubtless they also believe in Father Christmas.If we leave the EU in March without signing a deal, we would not be “crashing out” or “falling off a clf”. Nor would it be accurate to describe this as a “hard” Brexit.Rather, it would be a clean Brexit, a full Brexit, a true Brexit, in contrast to the half-baked non-Brexit proposed by Mrs May.Mrs May’s “deal” was the Remainers’ Revenge. You only had to look at the expression on the face of Jean-Claude Juncker to know what had happened.The EU got everything while we got nothing. And we were due to pay £billion for the privilege.Now that Mrs May’s capitulation of a “deal” has been consigned to the knackers yard, we should devote our energies to preparing to leave in March without any such deal. I am not suggesting that a No- Deal Brexit would be roses all the way. There would be some immediate dislocation that would carry some costs. But they would be relatively minor and short-lived. And it would be wrong to mistake such short-term minor disruption for the eventual destination.Just like umpteen other countries around the world, we can thrive outside the EU — without anything like Mrs May’s deal.Within a few years I am sure we would look back and wonder how anyone could have thought otherwise.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was there because I tried to take my own le, I couldnt take it any more.My husband was there because of his back, its painful being in the car.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Winston is  this year and when you reach  youre entitled to sheltered housing.However his birthday is in May and we could be dead by then. Im worried we are going to die here.Universal Credit is the Governments new flagship benefits system, but it has been slammed by charities and claimants who say it is pushing more people into poverty.Currently it takes five weeks to get the first payment, leaving many people in insurmountable debt, and working families have to pay childcare costs upfront, before later claiming back  per cent of the cost.The Sun is campaigning for the Work Allowance to be raised and the taper rate reduced to p for every £ earned to help at least four million families hold on to their hard earned cash.A spokesman for Colchester Borough Homes warned could take up to two years for some people to get a home.As a general rule this meansany applicant presents as homeless and we believe they may have a priority need, we may have a duty to provide accommodation while we look to find a housing solution that relieves their homelessness.If we do not believe they have a priority need, accommodation will not be provided but we will still assist them to secure alternative accommodation.If we are unable to relieve their homelessness, we are required to make inquiries under the full or main homeless duty.If we accept this duty, temporary accommodation will be provided and their banding on the housing register will be amended to reflect this.Applicants will then remain in temporary accommodation until they are either housed through the housing register or we end the duty by placing them in private sector accommodation.It is dficult to determine theof time an applicant will have to wait for specic property types to become available, as applicants are able to decide this by bidding on properties.In general, most applicants wait in excess of  to  months."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000462343312.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"banksy style artwork rat umbrella japan rail

a monorail station in the centre of the city, government official Koji Sugiyama told AFP.It appears to have been done late last year, with residents phoning in about the graffiti at about that time.Sugiyama said: We think theres a possibility it has been done by Banksy.The government removed the door and placed it in storage yesterday to protect it from possible damage, Sugiyama said.The government were reportedly in discussions on how to very the painting.The identity of Banksy, a street artist from Bristol known for his political commentary through art, is known to only a handful of friends.The artist showed his sense of humour last October when a painting of his sold for £million – moments before it shredded itself via a machine built into the frame.This led to the value of the artwork actually increasing, and led to some other owners attempting to copy the shredding process, and ruining valuable artwork in the process.In  a British claimed to have unmasked the mysterious graffiti artist after photographing a man finishing off an artwork in Bethlehem which later appeared on his website.Meanwhile in December last year a steelworker woke up to find a £million Banksy painted on his garage in South Wales.Rumours have long circulated about the true identity of street artist Banksy.A number of people claim to have spotted him at work but no sighting has ever been

letter","story":"Much-loved Sue East, from Bath, Somerset, was just  when she died on December  following a short battle with cancer.On the day she died, she penned a heart-wrenching final letter to her pupils, telling them she was going to die soon and thanking them for their joy and friendship.Mrs East quoted a passage from C.S Lewis  novel, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, comparing death to sailing over the horizon in a small, round boat.At the end of her letter, she wrote: Never forget there is fairy dust to be found in every situation, no matter how dficult.And yesterday, almost  pupils, parents, ex-pupils and staff members crammed into Bath Abbey to say farewell to the former headteacher of St Andrews Church School in the town.Past and present pupils of the school sang at the funeral, and covered Mrs Easts coffin with drawings of fairies, butterflies, love hearts, rainbows and fairy dust.Tributes paid by pupils said that they loved their headteacher, and described her as: Fun, lovely, exotic, glittery, the best teacher, kind, caring, taught us to believe in ourselves, sprinkled fairy dust everywhere.And her colleagues described her as an extraordinary friend and colleague, and bonkers, as all brilliant people are.Mrs Easts three children, John, Susannah and Josiah East, all read touching tributes to their mum, alongside the readings from staff members, close friends and Rev. Simon Holland.Her eldest son, John, told how his mother loved to refer to children as creatures.He said: Mum lived freely and selflessly. I am humbled to have received a love so unconditional. Mum didnt just love us, she loved all the creatures she worked with.I would encourage you to live your lives with love to all people.Her daughter Susannah said how her mothers spirit lives on, and that she was with them all at the funeral.She added: She said that death is not to be feared, for it is only coming home. She said how even in the most dficult situations, you find fairy dust.I loved you to the moon and back. I miss you. I look forward to seeing you on whichever shore you find yourself on."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000460287938.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dover prepared no deal brexit","story":"Doug Bannister, the new chief executive at the port which handles , lorries a day, said: “Throughout the Brexit debate what people have been desiring is certainty. Uncertainty is continuing — but we are prepared.”Meanwhile Irish premier Leo Varadkar said he would rather see a No Deal than accept a time limit on the backstop designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland.Just hours earlier Eurotunnel announced it was taking steps to ensure a No Deal would have “minimal” effect. It said: “We have adapted our infrastructure so that, with or without a deal, traffic flow through will be maintained.”And last week the chief of Calais insisted a No Deal would not mean extra checks for hauliers.Jean Marc Puissesseau said: “We have heard so many things about a hard Brexit. We have been preparing for a No Deal for a year. Brexiteers immediately leapt on the statements.Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover, said: “The merchants of Project Fear tell us there will be chaos at Dover and lorries backing up all through Kent. Yet the port of Calais have said there won’t be any holds up on their side, now the Port of Dover says they too are ready to leave the EU.”Colleague Anne-Marie Trevelyan told The Sun: “It’s fantastic to hear the confident voices of our critical businesses — Dover, Calais, Eurotunnel — confirming they are ready for Brexit.Arch Eurosceptic Jacob Rees Mogg added: “Project Fear is disappearing into the mists of time.”Researchers at Imperial College last year warned they believed extra checks at Dover could lead to a dramatic increase in congestion on motorways, with tailbacks of up to  miles as well as local congestion.Dover yesterday admitted “external factors such as border controls could slow things down”. But Mr Bannister said such delays would happen at “every EU-facing gateway” across the UK.He stepped up demands for Theresa May’s Government to do all it could to help industries that rely on the port moving goods worth billions each year between the UK and Europe. But he insisted no other port had such experience of dealing with disruption.He said: “Within a few days of the last signicant incident of Operation Stack in the infamous summer of , Dover was once again handling record volumes.”Meanwhile Brexiteers said they wanted the Government to increase pressure on Ireland to admit there would not be any threat to the soft border separating the North from the Republic in a No Deal.Mr Varadkar made it clear in talks with Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Emmanuel Macron that he preferred No Deal to limiting the backstop as he would prefer to blame the UK for any chaos than suffer domestic humiliation.But his stance was undermined as his deputy Simon Coveney was caught conceding No Deal would still require border checks too. In a taped conversation with transport minister Shane Ross, he said Dublin must not publicly admit that will be the case for fear of a public backlash.Sterling jumped . per cent against the euro — its strongest rally in  months.Later in the day it dipped to €..It rose . per cent against the dollar, to ., before falling to .. The FTSE  index of blue chip companies experienced a choppy session yesterday in the wake of Tuesday’s vote.It closed just . pointsdown at ,..Mr Carney told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee “the market is waiting”, adding that he expected continued volatility.Carney said the rebound in Sterling reflected market sentiment that the chances of No Deal had waned.Financial markets believe Brexit could be delayed, he added.The EU Commission yesterday conceded that it is relying on getting a deal past British MPs to avoid such a scenario. The recording, published by the Irish Independent, will embarrass Mr Coveney and heap further pressure on his government to compromise.He had been speaking at the end of a press briefing, at which he had just minutes earlier insisted: “We are not planning to put checks on the border.” But when asked about the possibility of controls on goods he replied: “Yes, but we can’t get into where they’ll be at this stage”.He added: “Once you start talking about checks anywhere near the border, people will start delving into that and all of a sudden we’ll be the government that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland.”Mr Coveney suggested new checks between the UK and Ireland could largely take place at sea to reduce the need for border infrastructure. His remarks came after No  sources said Mr Varadkar fears being toppledhe gives ground on the border.Speaking in Dublin later, Mr Varadkar insisted the ball was firmly in Britain’s court. Referring to the Commons defeat of Mrs May’s EU deal, he said: “That solution has now been rejected by Westminster — the problem now lies there.“The onus is on Westminster to come up with solutions that they can support, but they must be solutions that the EU and Ireland can accept. We have always said thatthe UK were to evolve from its red lines on the Customs Union and the Single Market, that the European position would evolve also.”Asked what plans it has in place to avoid a hard border, a Commission spokesman said: “We have a deal on the table andthis deal is ratied nothing of this sort will happen.“What you are describing is a situation that would result from a No Deal exit, which we may be closer to but it’s not yet certain. We’ll try to make it not happen provided that we know what’s next as we’re expecting the next move from the UK.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the meantime, all options are on the table.The party boss said Labours first option would be an alternative plan based around a permanent customs union - without explaining how to get the proposal approved.In a concession to pro-EU supporters, he added: If support for Labour’s alternative is blocked for party advantage, and the country is facing the potential disaster of No Deal, our duty will then be to look at other options which we’ve set out in our conference motion, including the option of a public vote.But asked whether Labour would support Brexit in a future manesto he refused to reply, saying: Our manesto will not be decided by me alone - I will be one of many people in the room deciding that manesto.Labour MPs immediately stepped up the pressure on Mr Corbyn to come clean on his plans.Remainer Luciana Berger said: After the vote of confidence was defeated, we now know a General Election is off the table and any chance of Labour negotiating its own Brexit deal has gone.“Labour needs to decide to follow its democratically agreed conference policy of campaigning for a new public vote.If it instead backs some version of a Brexit deal which is worse than the deal we already have inside the EU and would leave the country worse off, it risks losing millions of supporters and alienating a whole generation of young voters.The Lib Dems said that as a result of Mr Corbyns continued fudge, they would no longer join him in trying to trigger a General Election.Leader Vince Cable raged: “Since he appears to be determined to play party political games rather than acting on the wishes of his own members and MPs, he will no longer be able to rely on our support for further no-confidence motions.After surviving last nights vote, Mrs May invited Mr Corbyn and other opposition leaders to meet her for talks on the way forward for Brexit.But the Labour boss refused - saying hed only take partthe PM immediately ruled out No Deal.It would be welcomed by big business - but Brexit voters would be unhappy because it would mean Britain accepting open borders, and following European rules without a say.HOW LIKELY   HARD AS NAILSMost of the Tory Brexiteers who oppose the PMs deal want her toto Brussels and strike a tougher line.But Eurocrats currently insist its impossible to re-open negotiations.HOW LIKELY   REFERENDUM RE-RUNDozens of MPs are hell-bent on forcing Mrs May to hold a second referendum so Britain can stay in the EU.Yet without the support of the Government its unlikely the second vote could become a reality.HOW LIKELY   DEAL OR NO DEAL If Mrs May cannot pass a deal, the legal default is that we will leave the EU without a deal on March .Despite the legal position, the majority of MPs insist they will take any measure necessary to rule out No Deal.HOW LIKELY   MAY TRIUMPHS - EVENTUALLYCabinet ministers remain adamant that a version of Theresa Mays plan will eventually pass the Commons, even after losing last night.They believe sceptical MPs will lose their nerve as Brexit Day approaches - terried of either No Deal or a second referendum.HOW LIKELY   Health Secretary Matt Hancock blasted: Given Jeremy Corbyn will talk to Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA it’s astonishing he won’t talk to our Prime Minister about Brexit.But Shadow Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner defended his leader, saying: Jeremy is actually sticking to his principles, and many of us would say that is what he always does and that is why people in this country respect him.The PMs talks with MPs across the political spectrum are continuing today."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000462138908.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"cabinet ministers set to back second referendum which could cancel brexit","story":"A group of Tories launched a fresh push for another Brexit vote this morning - saying another isive campaign was the only way to break the deadlock in Parliament.Ex-minister Phillip Lee, who quit over Brexit last year, claimed there were many more MPs who were ready to join them, but was a big task to get everyone on side.He said conversations were happening all the time but it was a minority sport at the moment.We know of Cabinet ministers, junior ministers, backbenchers, whose heart and perhaps head are already here but all have inidual circumstances, he added.Each colleague is taking their time to reach their judgement.Inside the Cabinet DWP boss Amber Rudd and Business Secretary Greg Clark are thought to be most likely to back another vote.Dr Lee said there was little point in the PM trying to tweak her dead deal as there was no majority for any type of Brexit in the House of Commons.MP Heidi Allen said many were scared to reveal their true feelings about another vote.We created this mess, she admitted. To come away and say we need to change and check things again is really hard. Its like saying we got it all wrong.I can see what an unholy mess this all is.As the Westminster chaos continues:If Parliament is deadlocked then it serves our interest to let the people back in.... so we are going into this with our eyes wide open, he said.Fresh research from the new Right to Vote campaign out today claimed that more than  per cent of Brits across Tory seats wanted another referendum.That includes  per cent of people in the PMs own backyard.The MPs also issued a threatening hint that they would rather have a general election and let Jeremy Corbyn into No than allow Britain to leave without a deal.When asked whether he would consider voting no confidence in the Government, Dr Lee said no one wants to do that, but added: No needs to recognise that passions are equally strong on the no Brexit side as on the Brexit side.He warned: I dont think it would be a good idea for the Government to push us up against the wall at the end of March.Today the Government confirmed that the next Brexit vote would likely take place on January .But ministers have to put down a motion on Brexit by Monday to lay out their plan B.Mrs May is continuing talks with opposition leaders today - but Jeremy Corbyn is refusing to take part."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000460519499.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"karren brady freedom of speech not harassing mps","story":"Both are important and much cherished rights that have been fought for over the years.But something really scary is happening in this country. I’m talking about the footage of Anna Soubry being harassed and bullied in the street which has led to a man being arrested.Who would have thought we would live somewhere where people think it’s OK to aggressively call an MP a “slag” and a “Nazi” to her face — simply because she has a view that they don’t agree with.When it comes to political harassment outside Parliament, some people have suggested that women are disproportionately being targeted. I’m not sure that’s true.Journalist Owen Jones was also followed down the street in an equally bullying way.And not so long ago, Jacob Rees-Mogg was verbally attacked on his own doorstep in front of his children.The sad truth is that there is a nasty taste about politics in everyone’s mouth at the moment.And this kind of behaviour isn’t a million miles away from the way that politicians treat each other in the chamber.PMQs has become a ludicrous, abusive, screaming match full of insults and contempt. Sometimes it’s worse than that and the confrontation is pre-meditated.Not so long ago, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for Tory MPs “not to be able to show their faces in public” without being challenged by “direct action”.Since he said it, the atmosphere both inside and outside Parliament has become considerably more feverish. But the point is that some people take their lead from the way politicians treat each other.Politics should be all about serving people before you serve yourself.And there was a time when we trusted our politicians to do the right thing for the right reasons.But that trust is gone.In fact, people are becoming sick to the back teeth with politicians doing things that suit them, rather than the country.Whether we like it or not, the majority voted to leave the EU. But there is no doubt that some people feel they were misled or the terms weren’t explained to them. Andpeople were angry before the referendum, they are even angrier now.But they are going to have to find a dferent way to express it than by shouting threatening abuse in people’s faces.Politics is hard enough without fearing for your le and needing security to go to work.This country is changing — and not for the better. We have no tolerance for other people’s views, or when things don’t go the way we want them to. We all want our own way.The stakes are very high. And no one trusts their politicians to do what they want them to do in the way they want them to do it.So their response is to hunt them down and hurl abuse.It used to be that this sort of thing only happened on social media, and we all agreed it wouldn’t happen in real le. But look, it now is.People sending out this abuse should be held to account for their actions and words.Shouting in someone’s face in a threatening manner is not acceptable behaviour. It’s harassment and utterly deplorable.But also, politicians need to start building trust again. They need to say something and mean it,  and do the right things for the right reasons.I’M no stranger to criticism. And normally it’s water off a duck’s back.But I really take issue with being called a “passenger” this week, together with my friend Lord Sugar, for our attendance at the House of Lords.I want to make something very clear. Despite being a full-time CEO, I have voted in  per cent of isions, speak once a month and have never taken a penny of the daily expenses, allowances or fees. Lord Sugar, like me, does not take a single penny.People seem to misunderstand the role of the peers in the House of Lords. For a start, quantity has never equalled quality. But also, we do not implement legislation.We use our le skills and experience to help draft legislation and improve it by suggesting amendments that make the bills work better in the “real world”.Our second priority is to hold the Government to account by questioning ministers, seeking information and debating government policy.We also debate issues. In the Organ Donation debate I spoke in recently, contributors included a board member of patient groups, a surgeon, the chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons, a medical professor, a doctor and one of the heads of NHS Blood and Transplant – all of whom also happen to be peers making valuable contributions to help government work better.So I don’t like being called a passenger, because it’s wrong. The reason I am a peer is I want to try to help make the world a better place. That is my only motivation to be part of the House of Lords.So I’m a bit annoyed that Lord Sugar and I are being picked on because we are on the telly.We need peers to have real-world experience and make their contribution, which Lord Sugar and I do.We do it for free and we will keep doing so. And we will do so proudly.EEK! The Channel  show Shut-Ins: Britain’s Fattest People made for some seriously disquieting viewing on Wednesday.It’s hard for the average viewer to understand how someone could allow themselves to become so obese that they are bed-bound.Harder for me to understand is the people in that position who allow their children to become their carers.I know it’s not easy to lose weight and keep it off, but asking your eight-year-old to look after you is not only ruining your own le, but hers too.What child should be the main carer for their obese mother WHEN I read the break-up statement from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, , and his novelist we, MacKenzie, earlier this week I was struck by how impressive it was.“If we had known we would separate after  years, we would do it all again,” the statement read.The couple wished each other well with no regrets and it sounded like the near-perfect separation.And then, the next day, came the news that photos of Bezos and the woman he has allegedly been having an affair with for the past eight months were about to be published.So I guess he jumped before he was pushed, as it were.How disappointing.I WATCHED a really disturbing clip this week of a hooligan sneaking up to a sleeping homeless man in Leeds and – to impress some of his yobbish mates – blasting a really loud air horn in his ear.It’s one of the most disgusting acts I have seen in a while.Tormenting those less fortunate than you and picking on them because you consider them worthless is the lowest of the low.Many people living on the street have addiction or mental health problems. Treating both is important.But just as important is treating all people with dignity.EQUALLY as shocking was the story about three men who attacked two others walking along London’s South Bank, apparently because they were holding hands.This blatant homophobia feels archaic – and needs to stop.I hope when the pathetic perpetrators are found they get more than a telling off and a caution.ANYONE  stle a yawn reading about writer Yann Moix, who said in an interview this week that he finds women of  “too old”.The Frenchman continued: “I prefer younger women’s bodies, that’s all. End of.“The body of a -year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of  is not extraordinary at all.”Apparently Yann would be “incapable” of loving a woman aged  or above – despite being  himself.Let’s face it, any body belonging to a -year-old – male or female – is probably not what it was at .So since he seems to be talking only about attraction, not love, why on earth he thinks a woman of  will want to look at his body is anyone’s guess.But also, who would want to be with someone as superficial as this APPARENTLY, Wayne Rooney has been banned by we Coleen from leaving the house without her following his drunken arrest at a US airport.Ex-Manchester United star Rooney, , who now plays for Washington’s DC United in the US, was arrested for public intoxication on December  at the city’s Dulles International Airport.The former England captain received a furious phone call from Coleen, who apparently yelled at him: “How many times do you need to be told ”Oh dear.

The full might of the British establishment has joined forces to overthrow the biggest democratic vote in our history.Together, they have strived to stop this country becoming truly independent once more. They have fought with the passion of true, eye-swivelling believers to keep us shackled to Brussels.AndTheresa May sees her deal voted down on Tuesday — and it looks like she is on course to suffer a defeat of historic proportions — they will take a great leap forward to achieving their goal.Oh, it will be dressed up and prettied to pretend that democracy still s in this country.There will be much prattle about “going back to the people” with another referendum. There will be talk about a “delay” in leaving the EU. It will all be meaningless flannel.The British elite wants to keep us inside the European Union. They are succeeding. Jolly well done, chaps.Never mind that a British Prime Minister, the coward David Cameron, looked us in the eye and told us our decision in the referendum was final.Never mind that the over- whelming majority of MPs in the House of Commons voted to trigger Article  and take us out of the EU.Never mind that at the General Election, both the major political parties stood on manestos that promised to honour the result of the referendum.Lies. Lies. Lies.Parliament is breaking with the people. Brexit is being stopped by the elite.

It is a sad state of affairs when you have to be brave to speak out against anti-Semitism.”Anyone who thought that Rachel was just a TV cutie smiling bravely while she spelled out words like “orgasmed”, “gobshite” and “bumhole”has seriously underestimated her.Rachel Riley has courage, grace and eloquence.

So expect some politicians to miss the point entirely and make it more “inclusive”.ASKED to produce a list of the th Century’s most iconic explorers, everyone would probably name Scott of the Antarctic, Roald Amundsen, Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay.Everyone, that is, except a group of BBC “experts”, who ignored all of the above and replaced them with Jane Goodall and Gertrude Bell last week.I don’t even need to explain why, obviously.The names alone tell you it’s all down to the deranged, obsessive PC box-ticking that governs everything the BBC does and makes a farce of its new voting series Icons, which has the nerve to claim: “We want your opinion.”It doesn’t, obviously. It wants to impose the BBC’s right-on opinion on you and swallow its rewritten version of th Century history in the process.So for quota-driven reasons, Elvis didn’t make the entertainers shortlist and Alexander Fleming was left out of the last four scientists, despite discovering penicillin.But while Margaret Thatcher was included among the political finalists – and, boy, that must have hurt the BBC – they totally ignored her Falklands and Cold War victories in favour of re-styling her as a female gender warrior, almost the very last thing the former Prime Minister actually stood for.The episode where this series’ barmy levels of political correctness will really be laid bare is the Sports Stars episode, which has named Labour-supporting Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson as one of the th Century’s four greatest icons, but left out Jesse Owens, George Best, Usain Bolt, Rod Laver, Olga Korbut, Roger Federer, Eric Liddell, Martina Navratilova, Seb Coe, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Carl Lewis, Diego Maradona, Michael Jordan, Ayrton Senna and even the talisman of our greatest trophy-winning team of all, Doug Rougvie.Shameful.This Morning’s Alison Hammond, , metres above sea level, in the ski resort of Val D’Isere, interviewing skiers ­wearing skiing gear: “Why are you here ”THE Voice UK contestant Dean Mac is living the dream. How do we know He told us all, on Saturday night.“I’m living the dream,” he boasted, “in a really cool penthouse apartment, in the centre of Manchester. Duplex, with a pool table.”He also told us he performed “baby-making music,” though the world had been surprisingly slow to acknowledge Dean’s “triple threat” potential.“I went to LA, Paris, Liverpool, as a choreographer dancer, and one day a music producer said, ‘You need to be the front guy’.“The next stage now is to release the beast of my showmanship and have my craft appreciated.”So, on Saturday, he unleashed it in the direction of the four Voice judges and, honestly, the reaction was almost perfect.Hardly a serious button flinch or a twitch or a hint one of them was going to bite. In fact, he’d have had more luck getting the four heads on Mount Rushmore to turn.A response that said: “If that’s baby-making music, the human race is gone in  years’ time.”The saving grace of the ITV show’s format is that there’s nothing he could do or say to the judges afterwards either.Dean Mac just had to trudge back to his “really cool penthouse apartment”.Living the dream.Chris Kamara: “He headed his shot just over the bar.”The food: “Pizza, pasta, ravioli and all that s***.”I know.

Jacob Rees-Mogg invited leading Tory eurosceptics including Boris Johnson, David Davis and Iain Duncan Smith to a celebration party. Guests were greeted with a champagne flute at the door of the Tory MP’s pound million mansion just minutes from the House of Commons. The other side of Westminster, Theresa May was contemplating her humiliating defeat and steeling herself for another tumultous day ahead. Her strategy for surviving the no confidence vote was to make sure she didn’t take the fizz out of the Brexiteers champagne too early.   Instead, she waited until after the result was announced by her chief whip before inviting Jeremy Corbyn and other party leaders to talks. But before they even made it to the steps of Downing Street she had scuppered any attempts at compromise by ruling out a customs union. It is Labour’s biggest ask - and would infuriate hardline Brexiteers - but is also one of the few plan Bs that could command a majority in Parliament.  Instead - as the clock ticks ever close to crashing out of the EU without a deal - more stalemate beckons. Over the next few days the PM will try to win over the leaders of smaller parties and backbench Labour MPs. But her refusal to even countenance budging on her red lines suggests she is putting the Tory party ahead of the national interest. She has just four days to try to reach agreement. At that point the Government will have to table a fresh motion which - crucially - can be amended by MPs.   Parliament will take control of Brexit with a series of votes on their own alternatives. Pro-EU MPs are expected to demand the Government rules out a no deal, delays Brexit or holds a second referendum. Even though the votes would not be legally binding, it would be politically impossible for the PM to ignore them. With a softer - and delayed - Brexit looking the most likely outcome, perhaps the champagne should have been kept on ice.

According to the , the Chancellor told industry chiefs the government may have to acquiesce to demands from Remainer MPs. He added Article , setting the date of Brexit as March , could be revoked by the MPs as an ultimate backstop. He told bosses of Siemens, Balfour Beatty and the CBI a decision would happen within  days adding: It wont take very long. It comes despite Theresa May refusing to publicly take No Deal off the table as demanded by Jeremy Corbyn last night. Mrs May met the SNP , Lib Dems and Plaid Cymru for talks on the way forward and will meet Green MP Caroline Lucas this morning. But Labours leader is boycotting the meetings until she takes the catastrophe of no deal off the table. It is understood Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has made contact with his Labour show Keir Starmer but no meeting has been agreed.   Last night Theresa May refused to accept Mr Corbyns ultimatum, saying outside No she was disappointed with him. He spokesman added: She is determined to deliver on the verdict of the British public and that is to leave the EU on March  this year. But the Chancellor sent a very dferent message in the leaked call, which according to the , took place just after Mrs Mays Brexit deal suffered the worst defeat in House of Commons history.  In a transcript published by the newspaper, Mr Hammond said there was a signicant majority in the House of Commons against no deal. And he said backbench MPs are seeking a binding and effective way to prevent the UK leaving the EU. Its backed by some very senior parliamentarians, the Chancellor is quoted as saying.  It will, as I understand it, run its parliamentary course over the next  days or so. By the end of next week we will have a clearer view. Mr Hammond was thought to be referring to a Bill by the backbench Tory MP Nick Boles to make a No Deal Brexit impossible on March . He is quoted as saying: What it proposes to do is create a parliamentary power to withdraw the Article  notice and to lay that on the table as a sort of ultimate backstopthe work the government is doing... fails to deliver.  Under EU law, the UK can cancel its notice to leave under Article  without Brussels permission. It would however need the EUs permission to extend the date of Brexit. The Tory MP behind this bid last night dropped one aspect of his plan to give the full scheme a greater chance of success. Nick Boles said he would no longer try to hand control of the Brexit process to the supergroup Liaison Committee of Parliament. “The bit that matters is the requirement that the PM requests an extension to Article she cannot get a compromise deal through the Commons within a few weeks,” he tweeted. “It is this that will stop no-deal Brexit.”  Meanwhile, Mr Hammond said, MPs will table amendments to Theresa Mays Plan B this coming Monday to decide their own way forward. If that initiative by backbenchers is successful that would be clear to you within the space of the next two weeks certainly, he said. But in a brutal slapdown, Balfour Beatty chief executive Leo Quinn is said to have told him: Will we anticipate getting back to a normal, ing government  Tory chairman Brandon Lewis today insisted No Deal Brexit is a legislative default. But he conceded: As the Chancellor outlined, Parliament of course does have potentially the ability as we saw with the rulings last week to do a whole range of things. He denied No Deal would definitely be blocked saying: What Philip was saying is his view is there is a way that Parliament could do that.

Yet within minutes, Downing Street insisted the stubborn PM would not budge on the plan that was heavily defeated on Tuesday. That response came after Jeremy Corbyn told Mrs May he would not enter talks with her unless she took no-deal Brexit off the table. The PM survived a bid to topple her when she won a no-confidence vote by  to ,thanks largely to her DUP pals and other Tories who just  hours earlier had decisively killed off her Brexit plans.   She immediately offered to hold one-to-one talks with Mr Corbyn and other party leaders in a bid to break the deadlock on our EU exit. But the Labour leader said: “Before there can be any positive discussions about the way forward, the Government must remove clearly once and for all the prospect of the catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit from the EU and all the chaos that would come as a result.” The PM had said: “I stand ready to work with any member of this House to deliver on Brexit.” She later confirmed Mr Corbyn had snubbed her invite for talks after she said she met with leaders of the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the SNP. She added: “I am shydisappointed that the leader of the Labour Party has not so far chosen to take part, but our door remains open.” Mrs May would have lost the no-confidence motion by just one vote had the DUP’s  MPs decided to vote against her.   There were accusations of hypocrisy levelled at the  Tories who helped bury her Brexit deal on Tuesday and the  who brought their own no-confidence bid on her leadership last month after not one Conservative voted against her. The DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds faced ridicule when he told MPs: “I’m always delighted when our opponents illustrate the strength of the relationship that we have, and what it is delivering for Northern Ireland.” Lib Dem Jamie Stone waved a credit card in his face – pointing to the poundbillion investment for Ulster the party was promised infor propping up Mrs May’s shygovernment after she blew her majority at the last election. Labour MPs rubbed imaginary notes between their fingers. And although Mrs May survived this no-confidence vote,she refuses DUP demands to dump the Irish backstop, she will require the support of Labour MPs to get a deal. The PM now has four days to try to come up with an shyalternative Brexit plan. She risks losing control of the process as MPs will be able to amend the fresh motion she tables next Monday.  They are expected to vote on a range of Plan Bs from a Norway-style deal to a second shyreferendum. Tory rebel Dominic Grieve launched two bills for a second shyreferendum yesterday while on Tuesday his colleague Nick Boles led a cross-party plan for MPs to seize control of Brexit. Both then still voted for Mrs May last night. And despite the Tories keeping her in office, the fragile party truce was close to breaking point. Party insiders admitted they were wary of a backlash from the Brexiteer Tories who she depended on to survive last night’s vote. Mrs May’s promise of “constructive” cross-party talks with backbenchers also soured as it became clear she expected her own deal to survive. The PM has come under intense shypressure from within to rip up her Brexit red lines – the areas on her EU withdrawal plan that she refuses to change, such as freedom of movement and leaving the Customs Union.   Tory veteran Ken Clarke said before last night’s vote: “Will the Prime Minister not – just as I have had to accept that the majority of this House is committed to the UK leaving the European Union – accept that she must now mody her red lines ” Justice Secretary David Gauke warned Mrs May she should not be “boxed in” by old promises. Labour’s Yvette Cooper said she had made compromise “impossible”. EU chiefs said they were prepared to renegotiate the Brexit deal –Mrs May drops her guarantees. With just  days to go until Brexit Day, she faces huge pressure to extend Article  to allow time to reach a fresh deal. Earlier, she appeared to keep the door open to the prospect. She said at PMQs : “The European Union would only extend Article  in the circumstances in which it was going to be possible to come to an shyagreement on a deal.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror its time lame","story":"NewsopinionVoice of The Mirror: Its time lame PM got real and faced the truthTheresa May limps on… still in office but hardly in power as the Brexit shambles continues with no clear end in sightShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsopinionThe enfeebled Prime Minister is plainly not up to the task in hand \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThanks to the DUP, Theresa May limps on… still in office but hardly in power.

Having suffered the worst defeat in shyParliamentary history, Mrs May finally did what she should have done when taking office – she reached out to opposition leaders.   Their reticence in accepting this belated olive branch is understandable. The PM has shown no indication she is prepared to compromise on her Brexit plans. Her appeal for MPs to act in the national interest would carry more weight had she not put her own party’s interest first at every stage. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was right to demand taking no-deal off the table as the condition for any talks. Mrs May must show she is ready to make concessions. If she is sincere about wanting progress, she also needs to start showing some humility and realism about her diminished authority.

The three-and-a-half-year-old was squashed in the rear footwell of a blue Audi convertible by Stephen Waterson, who wanted to stretch his long legs out in the front, jurors were told. As the tot cried and made choking noises, his mother, Adrian Hoare, just told Alfie to be quiet, the Old Bailey heard. Hoare,  and Waterson, , from Croydon, south London, are on trial accused of his manslaughter. Emilie Williams, , was sitting next to Hoare in the back of the car during the ill-fated trip back from shopping in Sutton, south London, on February  last year.  In a videoed police interview, Miss Williams said they all went together, with Marcus Lamb, , driving. She said she was forced to put a second youngster in the rear footwell next to Alfie because she was not allowed to take the childrens car seat. Miss Williams said Alfie was crying so much it sounded like he was choking, but that his mother said he was OK. Marcuss chair was right forward and Stephens chair was right back, she said. Alfie was kicking the chair, asking him to move it forward.  Waterson said no because he said he had to stretch his legs right out, Miss Williams said. He had enough room but he wanted to stretch them out because his legs are quite long. He moved it forward once but only for a few seconds, only a little bit but it gave Alfie more room. Adrian just kept telling him to be quiet and they would be home soon. Like We will be home soon, shut up.  Miss Williams said Hoare told her Alfie was only crying because he was getting himself worked up. When he went quiet she thought he had gone to sleep, the court heard. As we was pulling up, she tried to wake Alfie up. She told him not to be silly. She thought he was just mucking around. When Waterson took Alfie out of the car, the child was looking pale and not moving, the witness said.  Afterwards, Waterson threatened Miss Williams as he tried to persuade her to lie about what happened, jurors were told. He was telling me a lot of things. He said he would put me in the boot of the car and get rid of me. He said he would kill me, she said. Hoare was going along with it and helping, she added. Giving evidence via video-link, Miss Williams told the court that Hoare had slapped her cheek outside Asda after Alfie died. She said: It was when Stephens door got kicked down by police. It only left a hand print for about half an hour.  Cross-examining, Tana Adkin QC said that, according to Waterson, some of the shopping was put into the front footwell of the car. The witness said she could not rememberthat was right. Hoare denies manslaughter, child cruelty and common assault on Miss Williams. Waterson has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and intimidation of Mr Lamb. The couple and Williams have pleaded guilty to conspiring to pervert the course of justice by making  statements to police.

We were going over to Sainsburys just to wash, change our clothes and brush our teeth. After three months I couldnt take it any more. Since then they have been living out of Winstons Mercedes in Mersea, Essex, where Tinas parents live. With the cold weather coming, they are worried they may die in the carthey do not find housing soon.  While living in the caravan, Tina had spent about a year trying to bid for housing in Mersea but without success. The couple ended up driving to Mersea so Tina could be closer to her parents. She said: My dad has dementia and my mum uses a walking stick - they live in a one-bed flat so there is no room for us there. Colchester Council said they would assist me in finding private housing. I have called around  houses but they wont take us as we dont have a guarantor and they ask for so much money upfront. Ive even been looking at studio flats, or single rooms. Tina has been sleeping in the back of the Mercedes, while Winston takes the front seat. The couple drive around to supermarkets and public car parks around the island, where they will stay for the night. Tina has never worked due to ill health, but Winston was a bricklayer before the ordeal happened. Tina is worried he may never be able to work again due to his deteriorating condition. Tina added: We go to Beacon House in Colchester sometimes and they have done so much for us. Winston is  this year and when you reach  youre entitled to sheltered housing. However his birthday is in May and we could be dead by then. Im worried we are going to die here. A spokesman for Colchester Borough Homes said all cases are dealt with under the relevant legislation but it could take up to two years for some people to get a home. He said: It is dficult to determine theof time an applicant will have to wait for specic property types to become available, as applicants are able to decide this by bidding on properties.

Andy Anokye faces some  charges, including  of rape, after it is said he inflicted pain and suffering on four women. The -year-old, who performs under the stage name Solo, committed the offences over two-year period, a jury heard today. He denies all the charges, which also include five counts of  imprisonment, two charges of assault by penetration and two charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Christopher Quinlan QC, prosecuting, told Bristol Crown Court the women genuinely and honestly inidually recounted how they experienced abuse at Anokyes hands. A particular feature of this interrogation was the water-boarding - placing a flannel or towel over their mouth and once in place, pouring water on to the flannel or towel, Mr Quinlan said.  The prosecution claims Anokye, of grime collective Boy Better Know, recorded sexual acts on his mobile phone, and committed sexual and physical violence on the women. The abuse involved a kne or knives and an interrogation of the women and their mobile phones, Mr Quinlan claimed.He added: The prosecutions case is that he appears to derive satisfaction and sexual pleasure from inflicting pain and suffering on these four women. He tortured and sexually violated each of them. His domination was physical and mental and it left each of them in fear. Mr Quinlan said that Anokye filmed the alleged abuse because he was confident the women would not disclose what had happened. He told the jury Anokye beat and frightened the women into submitting to his sexual demands. The court previously heard Anokye searched online for dacryphilia, where people are aroused by others in pain.  Anokye was arrested after one woman told a police officer he had assaulted and raped her at his flat in Canons Marsh, Bristol. Mr Quinlan said the woman had gone to the waterfront property, where Anokye became aggressive towards her. After detaining the woman, Anokye placed bleach on a cloth and put it over her face, the court heard. He told hershe passed out, she would wake up and think she was in a horror movie, Mr Quinlan said. He put the cloth over her face and mouth. You can imagine the terror. He strangled her with her own coat. Jurors were told Anokye slapped the woman and spat on her before asking her to put her hand in a blender. After leaving the flat, the woman met a friend who noticed she was upset and smelt of bleach, the court heard. Mr Quinlan said the woman disclosed the abuse to other friends, including a police officer.  She was later interviewed by officers from Avon and Somerset Police. Anokye was detained and told officers he and the woman had parted on decent terms after having sex. He said his sex with her was rough, strong and energetic but it was not one-sided, Mr Quinlan said. He said she was a willing participant in what he described as sex games, role play. He says the same in relation to each of the four complainants. Jurors have previously heard that the four women in the case do not know each other. Anokye, of Canons Marsh, Bristol, denies all the charges against him and the trial continues.

The other is a standard NHS hospital with caring but overworked staff. If Meghan Markle wanted to endear herself to ordinary Brits, she’s made a huge step by choosing NHS Frimley Park hospital to give birth, rather than the exclusive Lindo Wing where Kate Middleton has had all her three children. A source told The Sun that theDuchess of Sussex, , who is due to give birth in late April, wants to have her baby at the hospital in Surrey as she “doesn’t want to do anything that Kate Middleton has” . The news follows reports Meghan has been crowned “Duchess Dficult” by staff and has clashed with the Duchess of Cambridge, also , on a number of occasions.So how will her experience of giving birth dfer from that of her sister-in-law  Kates choice -The Lindo Wing   Kate has given birth to all her three children in the exclusive Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington. The private wing of the NHS hospital is also where Princess Diana gave birth to both Princes William and Harry. And the maternity ward is fit for royalty, with art installations, luxury toiletries and chef-made gourmet food - including afternoon tea. Often likened to a five-star hotel, new parents can even order a glass of champagne to toast their baby’s arrival.  A brochure for the wing reveals how each room comes equipped with satellite TV offering major international channels’. There is also a radio, bedside phone and a fridge’, a wide selection of newspapers and free WiFi. Patients are each given a private room with their own ensuite bathroom, stocked with hair-care products and lotions, with deluxe suites available for those who require extra space. Extensive menus created by their own in-house chef cater for special dietary, cultural and religious requirements, while the hospital also offers a wine list, with champagne on offer.  And a ‘celebration afternoon tea’ tea delivered to the new mum’s room is part of the maternity package. Parents can book luxury extras, including a post-natal massage to help new mothers stimulate milk flow, while there is also a secure, supervised nursery so parents can enjoy much-need rest. But the luxury comes at a price, with expectant mothers paying from pound, for  hours in the hospital for a normal delivery,rising to pound, for a deluxe package and even higher for the wards suites. Meanwhile, for a caesarean delivery the cost is a steeper pound,, while the hospital also offers even more pricy ’deluxe’ and ‘suite’ packages. As well as successful royal mothers, a host of celebrities have given birth at the unit, including Amal Clooney, who gave birth to twins last year.  But the hospital hasn’t satisfed everyone with one reviewer on Mumsnet complained of “grumpy” staff, a TV that didnt work and “barely edible food”. The reviewer, who said she’d paid pound, to have her baby there, wrote: “All night long the buzzer was going off and there was never enough people to help, sometimes the buzzer would be going for  mins, waking everyone  up too. A few times it took an hour for someone to come to help you. “The fruit plate was completely unripe and tasted either sour or of nothing.The food was barely edible. Some of the staff were lovely but the majority grumpy and overworked. “The final straw was when it came to check out and they told me I had to be gone by midday or they would charge by the hour for every hour over.” Meghans choice - Frimley Park Hospital  The hospital where Meghan has opted to give birth couldn’t be more dferent to the home-from-home of her sister-in-law Kate. Frimley Park Hospital in Frimley, Surrey, is just  miles away from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s newly-refurbished Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of Windsor Castle. But while it is more conveniently located, especially in the case of a last-minute dash to give birth, the hospital offers no special facilities or personalised treatment. The NHS-run hospital’s large labour ward doesn’t offer private care for maternity patients, while rooms don’t come with TVs or even en suite bathrooms.  There are  labour rooms available on the general ward, which saw , birth from April  to April . With the high turnover of births, women with uncomplicated deliveries stay for an average of six to  hours after birth. Partners are generally asked to go home overnight. While private postnatal rooms are available for pound-a-night - much less that Lindo Wing’s pound,-a-night price tag, they don’t offer any luxuries.  Meghan could also opt to stay in one of the four birthing rooms in The Mulberry Birth Centre, which focuses on “birth without medical intervention” and offer mood-changing lights and a pool roomshe prefers a water birth. But it does have some royal fans - Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, credits the hospital with saving her live after performing an emergency caesarean section after she had a placental abruption while giving birth in November . She ed there four years later to give birth, again by C-section, to her son James. Mums on Mumsnet have also given the hospital a thumbs up, although point to the wards overstretch staff.

Lexie Sienna Bryant lived in her mothers womb for two weeks after her brother, Kobi Nathaniel, died. She was then born prematurely at  weeks weighing just lbs oz. Before her arrival, doctors had already warned mum Gemma Bryant she would likely give birth to her within days of Kobi, who was born at  weeks. However staff at Hull Women and Childrens Hospital were amazed as it was a further  days before Mrs Bryant, , went into labour for a second time which gave Lexie a much better chance. After spending  days in the neonatal intensive care unit , Lexie was allowed to go home - with oxygen and a feeding tube - and has now turned one. East Yorkshire mum Gemma told Hull Live: Lexie is going from strength to strength everyday.   She is still under a specialist about her eyesight as she is short sighted and will need glasses by the age of three, but otherwise she is doing great. Even the physiotherapist hasn’t had to help her in any way as she is progressing well on her own, she really is a miracle. We are so proud of her everyday she is so very precious to us.  She rolls over and is still learning to sit up but it is to be expected that she will need more time to meet her goals, but otherwise doing us all proud. The twins were due to be born in May , but Mrs Bryants waters broke the day before she was due to go for her -week scan. The mum, who, along with husband James, has five sons between them, knew it was too early for her twins to be born and was told to prepare for losing them both.   It was eight days later, on Christmas Eve, when she went into full labour and Kobi was tragically born sleeping - with lungs too underdeveloped to be saved. After Lexie was born in January, she was rushed to NICU and she was  days old before her parents could give her a first cuddle. At the time, heartbroken Gemma spoke of a bittersweet rollercoaster of emotions after the pain of losing her son followed by the joy of giving birth to baby Lexie. Mrs Bryant said celebrating Lexies first birthday has been amazing. She said: Her birthday was amazing, it was such a happy day for us all we feel so lucky to be celebrating her special day, time really has flown past since her being born. We will be forever thankful for what the Nicu staff did for her and us.

Patty Hernandez has spent the last decade being pregnant, including giving birth to three sets of twins.The -year-old is now preparing to welcome a baby girl in May with husband Carlos Hernandez. I love being pregnant and raising children, so Id be happy to have more, even twins or tripletsGod blesses us that way, said Patty. The family, who need two fridges, spend on their food shop, and get through seven gallons of milk and  nappies every week.   Carlos, , who grew up in a large family with  siblings of his own, works as a floor cleaner to support the growing household in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA. Of the thirteen kids, there are five boys and eight girls, and six of the children are sets of fraternal twins, which run in Carlos family. All the children are all named with the letter C because of their father.  Carlos Jr, , Christopher, , Carla, , Caitlyn, , Cristian, , Celeste, , Cristina, , Calvin, , Catherine, , Carol, almost , Caleb  months, Caroline  months, Camilla  months and a baby girl on the way, who will also be named with the letter C. Patty said: Im so happy when Im pregnant, and Ive been pregnant for the last  years. Around three months after I have a baby I usually get pregnant again. I would be in shockI had another set of twins in my next pregnancy - the doctors cant believe that Ive had three. Its very rare, added Patty, who has conceived all her kids naturally, without the use of IVF.  Were just doing what God tells us to do. If God wants us to have  kids, Ill have  kids. Mornings start at am in the Hernandez home, when Patty wakes up to prepare a breakfast of cereal, pancakes or waffles.   After their morning meal the children practice Christian Devotional, which involves praying, singing and reading together as a family. The school bus stops by their house to collect the school-age children, while Patty stays home to look after the smaller tots and to carry out chores around the house. I try to do everything while they are at school because thats when I have the most free time, she said. If I have an appointment I take all of them with me.   Right now I have a thousand clothes to wash - thats at least five hours of folding clothes every two days. I do laundry at least four times a week. When the kids play, they often leave toys on the floor so I need to clean that up too. I try to give them a daily routine to clean up after themselves. They have their own chores.  The older one makes his own pancakes sometimes, but most of the time I am the one doing the cooking. Luckily, even though Ive been pregnant so many times, I havent ever had a problem with my weight. I always try to stay healthy, eat lots of vegetables, and Im motivated to do exercise. Even though its a blessing having so many kids, it can be really stressful too, and really loud in the house.   I dont really get time for myself. The older children do their homework at after-school study, and then get dropped home before six, when the family sits down to dinner. At their -seater table, Patty serves up meals of pasta, eggs, beans or salad, to be followed by more prayer and playtime until bedtime at .pm. Its a big blessing, but I cannot go out because I need to watch everybody all the time.  We have an aunt that stays with them sometimes, but thats the only time my husband and I get to ourselves. We really dont do anything like going on dates, not even on our anniversary. We dont leave the house on the weekend except for church, when were all squished into our car. Were trying to get a bus because we dont all fit, especially with one more coming in May.   Despite its challenges, the happy couple love being part of a big family, and are endlessly amused by the attention they receive. People ask me all the time, are they all yours  Everybodys amazed when they find out how many kids I have, especially because Im such a petite person. I never thought Id have so many babies. But now I have  kids - and counting!

Its now so successful that Liv Conlon, now , has hired her mum and brother to work for her. Straight-A student Liv, from Glasgow, stunned teachers when she told them she was dropping out before her final year to launch an interior design company. The young entrepreneur - who made pound, from her first business importing goods from China and selling them online at  - was certain she could make a go of it. She started ThePropertyStagers, which furnishes empty homes, with no financial backing.   The business made pound, in its first year, and turned over poundmillion in its second, when Liv was just .She now furnishes more than  properties a year, and has hired a team of  people – including her mother Ali, , and her brother Jack, .Liv has bought and renovated her own one-bedroom flat, which has now doubled in value to pound, – all without the help of the Bank Of Mum And Dad.And she believes being bullied every day at school for four years made her more determined to succeed. She said: I’ve always known from a very young age that I wanted to have my own business because I don’t take direction very well. When I was at school I always wanted to leave, I never wanted to be there. I just wanted to be in charge of my own le. I was very competitive at school, so I was always top of the class, so I guess people are threatened by that, which just brought people to dislike me. In my second to last year I decided to move school because after four years [of being bullied] I’d had enough of it. I decided that I didn’t want these negative people in my le who made me feel terrible every day.It made me more determined. Everyone who’s ever doubted my ability or capability or challenged that have completely put a fire in my stomach to go on and be better. The idea for ThePropertyStagers came about after Liv asked to furnish a property her mother, who ran a successful training business, had been struggling to sell for three months. They knew about property stagers, but were unable to find an affordable company, so Liv, who was living at home at the time, decided to do it herself. After Liv decorated the home’s interior with furniture and accessories, it sold within three days, for above the asking price – and the buyer even paid extra for everything in the property too. Liv, who left school before her final year with five Higher A grades, realised there was a gap in the market, and so the idea for ThePropertyStagers was born. She said: It was a pretty scary thing to do. I really could have gone on to do anything I wanted at university, so when I put to the school that I wanted to leave before my final year, they called me into the careers office and sat me down and said are you crazy, why are you leaving school when you have the opportunity to do anything you want  Liv, who works seven days a week and has just won a business award, revealed she first generated clients at local networking events, but admits because she was so young, she wasn’t taken seriously. She admitted that people probably doubted my ability, adding: It was quite a challenging environment to go into as the property industry is pretty much male-dominated.It was -year-old men, and I was coming in at the time with blonde, long curly hair and I actually looked . To start with my age worked against me.A few people probably doubted my ability until I started to get a bit more successful and build up a reputation. However, by explaining to potential clients how they could generate more money by selling properties that were ‘staged’ with cushions, throws and furniture, Liv managed to secure her first client.  She said: I started the business with absolutely no start-up funds. I went out to networking events which were free, and spoke to people and I was obviously looking to get business.From there, I was paid by the client for the installation, and then I would use that money to buy all furniture for that property – so the first couple of jobs, I never really made much money because I had to buy the stuff with the money I was charging them.The more installations I got to do, I could recycle the furniture, so that’s when it started to become profitable. Liv’s first paid job was staging a one-bedroom flat in Glasgow, which she kitted out with all the Ikea furniture she could fit into the back of her Vauxhall Corsa. After going it alone, Liv began to see the business start to take off when she became more active on social media. She said: I used to be a person who posted [on Facebook] only once a year. When I started to post photos of the business, it started to become a lot more successful - people started to know the name and know what I was trying to do. Her company became so busy, that Liv was generating enough income to employ her mother as her operations manager.At the time, Ali had her own successful customer service company for the motor industry, which she’d started  years ago, but she jumped at the chance to work with her daughter.  Liv admits she earns more than both her mother and her brother – who works for her as a stager – and she has the final say on decisions. The young business woman said while growing up, she would often attend business events with Ali – who even took her to a conference in LA when she was just . She was encouraged to listen to audio books by business gurus and motivational speakers such as Tony Robbins. Liv said of being her mother’s boss: ‘We’ve got a very unique relationship – we spend most hours of every day together.’ However, Ali admits that many people jump to the conclusion that it’s her business – and that Liv works for her. Ali said: I have to tell them that Olivia actually gave me a job. But it shows you how ageist people can be.  I’m very proud that she got so busy. My business was quite successful but it’s been a dream of mine to work with her so it was an ideal opportunity to do it. The duo admit that working together as mother and daughter isn’t for everyone. Ali, who separated from Liv and Jack’s father three years ago after  years of marriage, confessed: It’s never come to blows – and we’ve never left the day not speaking to each other, but obviously there have been some tough days.I think sometimes you say things to each other that you might not say to others because you’re family.You can be very honest with each other and you’re not always diplomatic.But when push comes to shove, Olivia will make the decisions. Even though ThePropertyStagers is now enjoying financial success, it hasn’t all been plain sailing.In the early days, Liv admits she sometimes felt as though she was winging it – and would go to great s to save money. Liv said: I used to hire a man in a van to pick up furniture.There was a sofa I forgot to tell him about, so he was going to charge me pound to pick it up. I was appalled at that so said I would do it myself. I drove a three-and-a-half hour round trip to fit these sofas in the back of my car, I couldn’t get in the car, spent two hours trying to stuff them in, then I had to carry them up four flights of stairs, all for pound. I must have spent hundreds of pounds trying to get them there.But that’s the stubborn person in me trying to save money when I was just a one-man-band. Even though the business is now a huge success, Liv is still very careful with her income.She doesn’t splash her cash on designer clothes and handbags – instead, she reinvests it back into the business, although she does enjoy ‘the odd margarita’. Liv, who believes millennials are taught to ‘dim our light and not shine so bright’, admits it’s been a ‘long, hard journey’, and working -hour days and six or seven days a week has been the norm. Although as she’s ‘not a party girl’, Liv doesn’t feel as though she’s missed out on socialising, she does believe running her own business has meant she’s had to grow up fast. She said: I missed out on being young with fewer worries – I could have a lot less worries at this stage [of my le] such as paying staff, and keeping everything going.Running a business, you have quite a lot of responsibilities for other people’s lives as well.  Her work-le balance has taken its toll on her personal le, though. Liv split with her boyfriend and admits being with someone as determined to succeed as her would take ‘a certain level of person’.When you’re young and you’ve had the success so young, it’s challenging to be with someone and them accept that work is very important to you, she said.Over Christmas, Liv spearheaded the #HomeChristmasMakeover in Glasgow – making over the homes of  families who are living in temporary accommodation.She said it’s taking part in initiatives like this that make her feel ‘most fulfilled’.Speaking about her plans for , Liv said: We’ve got massive plans for ThePropertyStagers, and one of those is to double the turnover this year, which is a big challenge. Another plan is to franchise part of the business.But something that is close to her heart, is becoming a motivational spokesperson for other young people, to show them that going to university isn’t the only route available after school.She said: My main mission is to really inspire young people to start business and be entrepreneurial.There’s this real thing aboutyou’re doing well at school you should be a lawyer or a doctor. A lot of people I went to school with who had similar grades to me went on to do university courses because their parents wanted them to.I’d love to educate parents and schools that there are other options than going to university. It’s still an option. But you can make a success at starting a business at a young age. Andall it went wrong tomorrow, Liv says she would start up another business.She added: I’ve got the mind-set that I’ve made money once, so I could come up with a new idea,it did all fail tomorrow, I’m sure I’d find a way to do something .

Combined with his distinctive Stetson hat and, later in le, his personalised mobility scooter, Pete became a local legend around pubs in Moseley, Birmingham, and the town of Alcester.   In a  interview, Pete said: “I don’t like shoes, or in fact anything on my feet.

Arguably, having a laugh is way more important than a persons looks or how much money they have as it means you can enjoy each others company no matter what. According to one study, poking fun at each other can actually strengthen a relationship - as long as youre both laughing.Obviously there is a line and were not talking about hurling abuse at one another or making snide comments to put each other down, which is not acceptable. Were thinking of stuff more along the lines of having a giggle when they look silly in a new outfit, or teasing them about things that arent too serious. According to Joyscribe, Jeffrey Hall from the University of Kansas conducted  studies involving over , people over the course of  years.   One of his key findings was that humour is a critical part of building a successful relationship. Soyoure reading this and cant remember the last time you had a proper laugh with your other half then it might be time to do something about it. In one of Hall’s articles,Humor in romantic relationships: A meta-analysis, it says the ability to laugh together playfully actually builds security between partners. Similarly, research from Appalachian State University says one of the strongest indicators of a healthy relationship is a couple who are comfortable enough make fun of each other on a regular basis.Again, the key is that both people find it funny.In a statement about his work, Hall explained: People say they want a sense of humour in a mate, but thats a broad concept. That people think you are funny or you can make a joke out of anything is not strongly related to relationship satisfaction. What is strongly related to relationship satisfaction is the humour that couples create together. Say you and your partner share a quirky sense of humour, but romantic comedies or sit-coms do nothing for either of you... Its not that any style or a sense of humour is any better or worse. He added that its important that you share a sense of whats funny, as it affirms you and affirms your relationship through laughter. Playfulness between romantic partners is a crucial component in bonding and establishing relational security. Particularly shared laughter, is an important indicator of romantic attraction between potential mates. However, Hall explained that having an aggressive sense of humour in the relationship it can be a bad sign.

The level of methanol in the -year-old mans blood was more than , times higher than the appropriate limit, a doctor revealed. Doctors transfused one can of beer every hour until Mr Nguyen was completely conscious at a hospital in the central Vietnamese province of Quang Tri. Fteen cans were used over the better part of a day.   Dr. Le Van Lam, head of the General Hospitals intensive care unit, told local media that the level of methanol in the patients blood was , times higher than the appropriate limit. To save his le, doctors immediately transfused three cansof beer to slow down his livers processing of methanol. According to Dr. Lam, one can of beer was given to Mr Nguyen every hour, and after  cans were administered the patient was completely conscious.  The doctor explained that a persons stomach and intestines continue to release alcohol into the bloodstream eventhey are unconscious or have stopped drinking, and for a period alcohol levels in the body continue to rise. Dr. Lam said that alcohol comes in two iants, methanol and ethanol, and the human liver breaks down ethanol first as a priority. Mr Nguyen became unconscious when the methanol in his system oxidised to formaldehyde which in turn produced formic acid, according to reports. To prevent oxidising formaldehyde to formic acid, giving beer to the methanol-poisoned patient gave medics enough time to perform dialysis.

The footage ends in images of the blockage of earth, sand and stones around three-quarters of the way down the ft well. It is believed to have been caused by a mini-landslide during the youngsters plunge, and is preventing rescue teams from reaching him. Officials involved in the massive search and rescue operation on land near Totalan, a -minute drive from the Costa del Sol capital of Malaga, can be heard talking amongst each other as the camera is lowered down the -inch-wide borehole.  Rescuers still hope they can pull off a miracle and bring him out alive as his anxious family wait. Julens dad revealed they are dead inside but still hold onto hope their son will be found alive.Today there was a setback for the operation as it emerged rescuers have had to delay plans to excavate a horizontal tunnel across the hillside to try to reach Julen over fears they could cause a landslide. They are now understood to be focusing on the other tunnel they were planning, a vertical tunnel they will create running parallel to the borehole Julen is in which is too narrow for an adult to fit into. Casing work to shore up the inside of the well the youngster fell down is continuing. The hold-ups are expected to affect the timetable of  to  hours officials said yesterday afternoon they believed they would need to reach the youngster and determine whether he is dead or alive.  Progress on ‘sucking up’ the earth and stones in the blockage separating rescuers from Julen has been slow and has also been delayed by machinery failure. Julen’s devastated parents Jose and Vicky, both , have spent most of the past four days and nights at the scene, sleeping on inflatable mattresses inside a tent. They were persuaded toto their home in the Malaga neighbourhood of El Palo briefly on Tuesday night to shower and pack a change of clothes. Jose is expected to address waiting journalists later today to update them on the progress of the rescue operation. Yesterday, in his first impromptu press conference since Sunday’s accident, he said: “We’re dead inside but with the hope we have an angel watching over us who is going to help him to come out alive as soon as possible.” He spoke after telling Spanish media how his son fell down the borehole at around pm on Sunday as he was getting more firewood for a paella he was preparing.  He told Malaga-based paper Sur: “My we went to phone into work to let them know she wasn’t going. “She was with Julen and asked me to keep an eye on him as she made the call. He was only a few feet away. “I went to get a couple of logs for the fire for the paella and he began to run. “We saw how he fell down the hole, my cousin more than me because she was closer.” Julen’s parents are being comforted by the father of a Spanish five-year-old girl killed by a paedophile in January . Juan Jose Cortes, who received a message of support from Gerry and Kate McCann after his daughter Mari Luz’s body was found, travelled to the search scene yesterday to meet Jose and fast food restaurant worker Vicky and is expected toagain later today.  A Swedish firm which helped locate the  Chilean miners rescued in  after  days underground has joined the massive operation to try to locate Julen ahead of his hoped-for rescue alive. Police insist they are working on the basis Julen is still alive. Privately officials have admitted the chances he will survive what could be around  hours underground in the best of scenarios are slim unless he is in an air pocket and has access to water. Julen’s dad has said the borehole - on family owned land - was made by a prospector at the request of his cousin’s boyfriend last month but no water had been found. The prospector has told police he complied with the law by sealing the hole after it was made but Julen’s family say it had simply been covered with stones that weren’t properly laid.  In May  the missing boy’s older brother Oliver died from a heart attack thought to be linked to a congenital heart defect. Julen’s grandmother Reme Garcia posted an emotional message alongside a hand-drawn picture of a heart sketched inside an imaginary hole at the bottom of the borehole. She said: “My little boy is here. “I’m waiting for you and I don’t know how to live without you. Hold on my little warrior. Don’t give up.You are a champion and your brother is with you.

Mother-of-two Belinda Nortons tips include advice on what to eat and drink, how to socialise and how to look after your mental health. Some of Belindas tips are rather unique, such as avoid sipping from straws as she thinks they create wrinkles around the mouth. She believes having a positive mindset, getting monthly massages and even making sure she has dates with her girl friends every fortnight help her stay young. Writing on her blog blivewear, she explains: Nothing beats a good girls catch up gym session, evening walk or even breakfast but girls need girls banter and this time is so important as a stress buster for all women.   As for massages, she argues they are not a luxury but rather, a necessity. Belinda, from Queensland, Australia, says: Loose and limber muscles mean less pain and less tearing or further ligament damage not only that but it creates better mobility and also flushes unwanted toxins creating a more youthful body and skin tone. She also told people to stop dieting and instead start boosting their bodies. Belinda wrote: Eat health foods that nourish your body regularly. Eat meals six meals the size of your two fist daily.   The fitness guru revealed another of her anti-ageing techniques is to eat blueberries on a daily basis. She described how they are full of antioxidants, have been found to improve our blood quality and therefore help our cardiovascular health and allow us to fight off diseases. Other foods she said enhanced skin health include spinach, almonds, salmon and vegetables. Processed foods are a no-no, she says, and calorie counting is not the way to live, in her opinion.  Belinda, on her blog, speaks of the importance of keeping the body hydrated by drinking enough water. She told people to begin every meal with a large glass of water and avoid sugary or alcoholic drinks. In terms of skincare, Belinda advised against baking your skin in the sun. She also warned people of the importance of removing make up before going to sleep and exfoliating every three days.  And she said you should wear suncream and sunglasses as much as possible. When it comes to exercise, Belinda urged people to try running less as it causes stress in the body. She revealed she tries to run short distances, and ies her regime with walking, light speed weights and circuits. Other things to incorporate into your routine, according to Belinda, are taking hair and nails supplements, yoga and meditation, having a positive mindset, listening to calming music and going for walks. The mum also advised having a bath, reading books before bed rather than using social media, limiting sugar intake and getting an early night.

Controversial artist Marisa Papens latest artwork features an eight-inch doll of herself - titled Ave Marisa - holding the Christ Child in her new FXCKRLGN series. A snap from her latest photo shoot shows her completely naked as she drags a large wooden crucix across a street in the Vatican with St Peters Basilica visible in the background. The doll sells for pound in a gallerys online shop, while the fine art print - titled Crosswalking by photographer Jesse Walker - is going for pound,. WARNING - NUDITY   Belgian model and artist Marisa started to gain notoriety - and court controversy - when she was imprisoned after going nude at the Karnak Temple Complex near the Egyptian city of Luxor. She also caused outrage after posing in front of Jerusalems Wailing Wall as well as in Turkey where she lted up her burka to reveal her privat parts inside Istanbuls iconic Hagia Sophia - a former Byzantine church and Ottoman mosque which is now a museum. Marisa and Australian photographer Jesse were arrested again when they took a picture of Marisa sitting nude on a pile of Bibles on St Peters Square.   Speaking for the first time about her stunts, Marisa said that she first started to ask herself big questions as a teenager and concluded that religion takes away inidual power. She said: You give your strength away to someone  when you dont knowthat person - be it Allah or God - exists in reality. Marisa said she has nothing against religion and realises that it enriches people, but she claims that it does not do enough good for the world.  She said that a prime example took place when she was on St Peters Square and Pope Francis appeared from the window to give a short speech and the traditional Angelus prayer. Marisa said: One of the many beggars on the square caught my eye, a barefoot gypsy lady with a badly deformed posture. I thought to myself, imaginethe Vatican was a place that actually helped people. Imagineall these huge churches opened their doors for people in need. Marisa said she is unfazed by the critics who call her an attention seeker and emphasised that her message is about change and not popular snaps for social media. She said: If being popular was my goal, I dont think it would be such a wise decision to upset two-thirds of the world. Jesse said he was very happy with the final results of the project.  He said: I shoot for Marisas personal projects and my label ENKI eyewear. For this shoot, Marisa and I had two very dferent concepts, but they balanced each other beautully. Marisa had her religious concept, and for ENKI it was about touring Rome and just having fun like you do when travelling. The photographer said that the pair is beyond obsessed - in fact totally crazy - about our message and creating beautul imagery.  He added: I like to think ENKI and Marisa are the two most controversial artists and brand on the planet right now, and thats something Im very proud of. In the future, Marisa said she hopes to move on to a dferent subject matter and focus more on the state of our planet. Marisa said: I have been a vegetarian for the last three years and the plan is to make a strong statement in  about how we keep animals for our own pleasure and amusement. A spokesperson for the Frank Rose Gallery in Los Angeles, which sells the artwork, said: I think anyone who has the capacity to understand art and its message can see why this whole concept is so special and next level.

The elite soldier, who is in Kenya training the countrys special forces, was on an admin run when al-Shabaab terrorists stormed the nearby hotel complex, killing  people, including a British charity worker. And he sprinted back to his car, where he had left his equipment, before heading to the hotel to take on the terror gang single-handedly. It had been reported that the soldier, a serving member of the elite unit, had been taking part in training Kenyan troops when they got word of the attack and went to respond. But Chris, who served in the elite regiment for  years, said: He was out shopping on an admin run. He had his equipment in the car, so when it all kicked off he sprinted back to his car and quickly got kitted up before heading straight towards the firefight.   When he arrived in the hotel he started organising the entire operation, directing the police and army. Then he went in there on his own to neutralise the enemy and rescue the hostages. His actions certainly saved many lives and shows the manner of these men, who are extremely brave and always ready. Pictures and video from the scene show the SAS operative in jeans and body armour, holding a gun, as he escorts bystanders out of the DusitD hotel to safety. The weapon he is seen clutching is a Diemaco C Carbine - standard issue for Special Forces soldiers. Chris, who served in the highly-secretive regiment for  years, said footage of the soldier showed he is a highly trained fighter who instinctively knew what he needed to do to save lives. And he praised his “creativity” in instructing Kenyan forces to block off roads and exits and storm the hotel on his own.  Best-selling author Chris, whose books are inspired by his SAS bravery, said: “That’s just what the guy does, it’s his nine to five job. He’s trained to the highest level to react to these types of situations.And counter terrorism operations are just bread and butter to him. “He was already there training Kenyan special forces, and then these guys go out to react to situations, and that’s how he was out on the ground. “The calibre of these types of soldiers is such that the other side,al-Shabaab, wouldn’t stand a chancethey came up against this guy. “He is trained to react to the threat. He will instinctively locate the threat, identy it and then neutralise it.  “His tactic is to shoot the enemy before they get a chance to shoot themselves. “You can see from the videos that he wasn’t cowering anywhere, he was aggressively moving on to targets, on the prowl hunting these animals down. “He was dominating the firefight, switching everything from their surprise attack to them being hunted, because they’ve now got a professional solider in the thick of it going after them.” Chris said he was impressed - but not surprised - at how the soldier took control of the situation, directing the Kenyan police and army as he engaged with the terror gang. He said: “Because the guy was part a training team out there, he was already up to date on every tactic they use and how to react.  “These guys can read the situation on the ground, immediately without briefings, and then they can adapt to that situation. “Obviously the guy had all the equipment with him, he had the weaponry, body armour and magazines, so once he was there it was just a case of reacting to the situation, finding the target and putting it down. “The Kenyan forces reacted first, but when he arrived on the scene he took over and started guiding everyone into firing positions, and then bringing the civilians out to safe havens. “You saw he was going in and bringing people out then putting them into a safe area and then going back in. For him that’s as normal as someone  going in to the office and doing their job. It’s as basic as that.  “He’s going in to an area where he will have trained countless times to engage targets and then cover your flanks and protect your flanks, using buildings, vehicles, and other structures to cover himself. “But then as soon as he sees a target he will engage that target. And I can guarantee he will be a hell of a lot more accurate with his weapon that the al-Shabaab guy. “So he will be putting a piece of lead through them and then moving on to the next one. It’s as simple as that really.”  And he said the soldier obviously made a calculated decision to go in alone, believing that it would be better than taking in less professional local troops. He said: “Clearly the guy is really creative. In every footage I’ve seen of him he’s doing it alone and hasn’t taken any of the local forces to give him back up.

The pilot had made clear he was prepared to make an emergency landing after the violent passenger attacked people around him. The man - aged  and reportedly recently released from prison in Thailand - went on a rampage on the A flight from Bangkok. Video shows the man tied with sticky tape and belts on the floor of the aircraft’s galley. Passengers “neutralised” him after stewardesses were unable to calm him - and he was tied on the floor of the jet for some four hours until the plane reached Russia.   A male passenger “hit the hooligan several times and with the help of other tourists tied him up”, said Colonel Irina Volk, spokeswoman for the Russian Interior Ministry. “Witnesses confirmed that the captain had warned passengers that they might need to land in China or Mongolia because of this hooligan”. The shocking air rage incident was on a packed alcohol-free flight from Bangkok to Russia’s third largest city Novosibirsk, operated by S, part of the same One World alliance as British Airways and American Airlines.  Some  were on board including babies and young children. The abusive passenger had been drinking whisky from a bottle he carried on board - and started “offensive and threatening behaviour” three hours into the seven hour  minute flight, according to witnesses.   Passenger Pavel Makarov posted: “I spotted him at the beginning of the fight – with a half empty whisky bottle and behaving strangely.” Four hours into the flight, the captain intervened, he said. “There were three ways out under international aviation rules - one, the hooligan calms down. “Two, we continue flying and give the guy away to police on arrival. “Three, the plane lands in China or Mongolia and we sort it out on the ground.”  But he said: “The abuser got more and more wild and finally passengers neutralised him “They tied him with sticky tape and belts.” The man was “hurt a bit” and was given medical attention while tied up. After landing in Novosibirsk, he man was taken away by transport police. S - Russia’s second largest airline after Aeroflot - confirmed the incident from January .  “The passenger behaved in inadequate way during the flight,” said a spokesperson. “He was drinking alcohol, disturbed other passengers and did not react to orders from the crew. “For the sake of security, stewardesses have called the hooligan to the galley in the rear of the plane and tried to calm him down. “But he began to wave his arms, to threaten and abuse the crew and passengers. “  “During the rest of the flight he was closely watched by one of the stewards and a doctor - one of the passengers. “As a result of this incident, there were no delays. “On arrival to Novosibirsk the hooligan was given away to airport police department where he was charged with hooliganism.” It is understood the man was later fined.

This tax relief would be beneficial as they moved forward with the new stadium project.#In January , the club owners informed the Supporters Society of their intention to proceed with the acquisition of the %+ shareholding in the club through the share issue, as previously discussed.#The share issue is a y and costly exercise for the club. The sole motivation of the owners is to offset the losses of the club against any gains made by Dark Blue Property Holdings.#The club met with the appropriate solicitors to discuss this matter over the following months in order to move the process forward.#In July  the Supporters Society enquired whether within this process they could move their class rights associated with the ‘A’ shares into a shareholding agreement.#The owners of the club took into consideration this request, as taking on the Society shares would save time and money needed for the share issue process, and therefore began negotiations in good faith to purchase the ‘A’ shares from the Society.#The acquisition of the ‘A’ shares has potential benefits for both sides, and while the negotiation of the finer details has yet to transpire, one such benefit is that the club could operate in a more commercial manner, which would allow for idends to be paid. This could also allow for greater investment into the club.#It is disappointing to see that the Society has chosen not to make it clear that at no time has the merging of the Dundee clubs ever been discussed in any of these meetings, nor has it ever been contemplated by the owners of the club.#The owners of the club will continue to take informed and proactive decisions that are best suited for Dundee Football Club.#"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee gran gets free cinema tickets after winning tele competition","story":"A grandmother from Dundee has won a pair of cinema tickets after winning a Tele competition.Jenner Christie, , from the Dens Road area, is the latest winner of two tickets to Cineworld.Every week we give one lucky person who appears in a photograph on our Going Out pages the chance to win a pair of tickets to the flicks.Jenner was on a night out at the Fairmuir Social Club when her winning picture was taken, before she was chosen at random.She said she was very surprised to find out about her win.She added: “I’m never out – the picture was taken at the club my cousin goes to all the time.“It was beginner’s luck.

That’s a worry.Seven goals in his first  games after arriving from Danes Aalborg in August suggested the man to get the goals to fire them to promotion had been found.The last seven games, with just one strike to his credit, have dampened such expectations.And while that work he puts in when up front, often on his own, means he continues to be a vital cog in the wheel for the team, there is little question he’d benefit from a regular strike partner.Of course, the arrival of Nesbitt and Smith should help ease the burden on whoever is right up front but only to a degree.Both are capable of chipping in with goals but a good chunk of the work they do is likely to be in creating chances as opposed to taking them.Putting more goals in the team would also ease the pressure on the defence.While the back four have been leaking too many goals this season, they’ve too often taken to the pitch knowing the loss of just one goal may well see a point or points dropped.That’s why the next couple of weeks will see Neilson, presumably backed by new owner Mark Ogren’s money, pull out all the stops to find another quality striker.Particularly in this transfer window, that’s usually easier said than done.If he succeeds and United are back in the top flight come the end of the season it would have been well worth the effort."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c051af07378a-e1543840266799-940x555.jpg ","title":"tom duthie scottish football should never allow merger of dundees clubs","story":"The latest outbreak of merger fever in Dundee was no more than another in a long list of  alarms among the city’s football public.It’s not unlike the hypochondriac who catches a cold and immediately thinks he’s gone down with pneumonia.The revelation Dundee owner Tim Keyes wants to increase his shareholding to over % and remove the right of the club’s supporters’ society to veto any merger with neighbours United, had temperatures running high.With another American, Mark Ogren, now in control at Tannadice, fans of both clubs had been examining the “symptoms” and reached the diagnosis that a coming together was desired.That shows the accusation the media never let the facts get in the way of a good story can also, sometimes, be levelled at supporters.All along a forensic examination of the timeline of those symptoms strongly suggested this had everything to do with Keyes wanting to be able to build his new stadium at Camperdown without having to get the go-ahead from the fans’ group.Moving away from Dens is another on the list of protected items they can block and,Keyes is going to spend millions on “Nou Campie”, it’s not stretching the imagination to see why he might not want to need permission from a group that won’t be asked to inject a penny.More signicant is the fact Dundee first raised the matter months ago – before Ogren was on the scene at United. Even though this was a case of putting two and two together and getting five, it shows, despite merger being mooted and quickly dismissed on numerous occasions down the decades, it remains a worrying subject for the fans.And while those further afield may see a lot of sense in a one-club city, for those punters who actually turn up at Dens and Tannadice, it is the nightmare scenario. They’ll take hard times like financial crisis and relegation and stick with their team but what they’d never do is watch a merged team.That alone is why such a move is too dangerous. The clubs should always take the “nos” of the fans who go to games over the “I woulds” of potential new customers of a ‘Dundee City’.There is every chance a build-it-and-they-will-come merger would leave us with a club only slightly bigger than the two that exist.That wouldn’t just be bad for the city but Scottish football and it makes it surprising that, when the topic is raised, no one at the top of the game has come out against it.While sporting performance is rightly the normal criteria for the make-up of our top ision,ever it was to be done on size of club, Dundee and United would be in there – and comfortably so.If Premiership membership was decided on that second basis the top  would be something like Celtic, Rangers, Aberdeen, Hearts, Hibs, Dundee United, Dundee, Motherwell, Kilmarnock, St Johnstone, Falkirk and St Mirren.The likes of Morton, Dunfermline and Inverness may argue they should be in there but it would be on the basis they have more potential than the names at the end of that list.When it comes to core support, the first seven clubs listed are untouchable. If Glasgow giants Rangers or Celtic, on their own, are bigger than the rest put together, those from the country’s three other major cities are also well ahead of the others below them.To reiterate, in all but exceptional circumstances, results should determine who’s in the top league, so it’s up to the likes of United to get back there by winning matches.But when the Tangerines and the Dark Blues are in the top flight, Scottish football is the better for it.That will always be the case."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"sir-andy-murray-from-dunblane-to-double-olympic-champion","story":"FROM gangly, wild-haired teenager to one of Britainrsquos great sporting heroes, Sir Andy Murray may have been forced to hang up his rackets but his impact will be felt for generations."},{"url":null,"title":"dennys-bosses-slam-unforgiving-customers-after-being-bombarded-with-terrible-reviews","story":"DENNYrsquoS bosses have hit back at ldquounforgiving customers who have left negative feedback after visiting the dinerrsquos newly-opened branch near Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"damien-duff-and-stephen-mcmanus-take-up-coaching-roles-at-celtic","story":"Celtic have confirmed that Damien Duff and Stephen McManus will join the clubs coaching staff, with former Republic of Ireland internationalist Duff taking charge as reserve team coach and McManus assuming the position of under- coach."},{"url":null,"title":"businessman-oli-norman-takes-full-control-of-seven-popular-glasgow-venues-in-15m-deal","story":"A GLASGOW entrepreneur has snapped up full control of seven popular city venues in a deal worth over pound million."},{"url":null,"title":"social-media-star-oli-keenan-to-represent-uk-in-performing-arts-olympics","story":"The mastermind behind the smash viral video of Pennywise the Dancing Clown on Halloween has been selected to represent the UK in the World Championships of Performing Arts."},{"url":null,"title":"indyref-2-statement-in-matter-of-weeks-says-nicola-sturgeon","story":"Nicola Sturgeon said she will speak about the timing of a second independence referendum in a ldquomatter of weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"straight-talking-damien-duff-ready-to-make-his-coaching-mark-at-celtic","story":"Damian Duff has conceded that one of his failings is a tendency to curse too much but the former Republic of Ireland internationalist is sworn to getting the best out of those in the underbelly at Celtic."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-keeping-tabs-on-scott-mctominay-situation-as-united-ponder-loan-move-for-midfielder","story":"Celtic are keeping tabs on Scott McTominays situation with Manchester United prepared for the midfielder to go out on a possible loan move before the closure of the transfer window.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13859701.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS171103908.jpg","title":"ayr united fans chance sleep","story":"NewsAyr United fans have chance to sleep on Somerset Park in homeless fundraiserThe fundraiser, being staged by Ayr United and homeless charity SeAscape, will be held under the lights at Somerset Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsAyr stars Robbie Crawford, Andy Murdoch, Craig Moore and Declan McDaid join Ky Kane of SeAscape \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United fans dream of playing on Somerset Park’s hallowed turf.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

Councils revamp of George Street the New Town that includes a reduction of cars, wider pavements, trees but less clutter, seating areas, and cycleways follows a series of plans over the past two decades that included incarnations such as a particularly unloved rising bollards restriction and street gazebos that struggled to maintain an anchor in the Scottish gusts, even with diners inside.Consultancy WYG, which won the civilian engineering support team contract to back up the Royal Engineers in construction, management and maintaining the infrastructure throughout Camp Bastion in Afghanistan, the massive former airbase now known as Camp Shorabak, was appointed to draw up a new permanent plan for the area surrounding the grand centrepiece providing cafe culture and better shopping and lestyle experience.So far, the plan has received a cautious welcome from the representatives of business groups and other organisations on the street that runs parallel to Rose Street and Princes Street.Read more:Mike Russell calls on UK Government to rule out a no-deal exit from EU now and foreverCastle Street, Frederick Street and Hanover Street, as well as Charlotte and St Andrew

Edinburgh, isreserving judgement on whether the plan will operate with military precision.He said: \"Yes, we want it to look good but how operationally is it going to work because people are running businesses, hotels, offices, there is also residential accommodation and they need services, they need access and how that will all integrate into the transport plans is something we really donrsquot know as yet.\"Read more:Edinburgh office rents to reach all-time highHe added: \"My impression is reasonably good so far but holding that position until we know what the operational implications are because itrsquos not just a street thatrsquos got to look good itrsquos a street thatrsquos got to work.\"He said members will meet in the new year ahead of the consultation closing date, January .This will include \"the traders, they are an important group and large in number but you have also got hotels and the Freemasonsrsquo Hall and Northern Lighthouse Board and Royal Society of Edinburgh

avenue, where the firm has had premises for  years.She said: \"Clearly, it represents a good opportunity for the restaurant to expand the outside dining offering, which is a signicant part of the business during the festivals and throughout the summer months.A matter of yards away, the next street, the pedestrianised Rose Street, is not directly included in the New Town revamp.Jeweller Alistir Wood Tait, in the street  years, said: \"The huge complaint I have here in Rose Street is the mono-block surface that was laid in the seventies has been so neglected that it is not fit for purpose.\"Irsquove got two empty shops opposite me, one of which has been empty for at least five years and the shop next to me is closing in six months time.\"The council say they donrsquot have the

servicing, and to cater for a wide range of customer access into the area, including retaining some parking\".Lesley Macinnes, council transport convener, above, said: \"Since its inception, our project to develop a long-term vision for George Street and the First New Town has had local businesses at its core - our ambition is ultimately to create a more welcoming, relaxing space for people

with the project, design consultants will be carrying out further, more in-depth work to engage with businesses, including face-to-face, business-focused questionnaires and additional workshop sessions in partnership with Essential Edinburgh, which will help determine business interests, allowing us to understand their operating needs within the emerging design.\"While this project focuses

I dont support independence for Scotland butBrexit goes ahead without any form of close working with the EU then I think it would be legitimate for the SNP to try and gain a new referendum on independence.If they then try to gain EU membership they will never succeed as long as Spain has the Catalan problem to deal with and France will be wary of Breton and Basque attempts to go independent. One partys mess has created a bigger mess for the UK and all of us are going to suffer because of it.\"\"I dont think any of the current leaders are up to the job of actually leading the country.

The pity is that now the crisis is here, Labour is also ided and still finds itself in the hands of an ineffective, elderly and backward looking leader who looks increasingly unlikely to provide the inspirational leadership needed to unite his party and the country.The other worry is that we crash out without a deal or we somehow get Brexit delayed or cancelled, the extremists on the right will take to the streets. Right now the politician who sounds most statesmanlike to me is Nicola Strurgeon - all the more remarkable as I have been a le long Labour voter and at heart a unionist, butit comes down to a union with a dysal England, I will vote to take Scotland out of the UK and, as soon as possible, back into the EU.\"\"We should leave without a deal and a year from now we will be wondering what all the fuss was about.

Conservative MPs turned out in force to block an attempt to throw the Tories out of office and call a general election.The  Democratic Unionist MPs joined with their minority Government allies together with Lady Sylvia Hermon, the Independent MP for North Down, to defeat the Labour motion by  votes to  a majority .The full number of Labour MPs available to vote -  - supported the motion along with the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and four independents.Earlier in the day, Ms Sturgeon was at Westminster to meet SNP colleagues for discussions on the partyrsquos strategy ahead.Having spoken to Mrs May the night before, the FM said she did not appear ldquoopen to new thinking.Speaking to reporters, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoThe PMrsquos position sounds asshe is deluding herself about what is possible in the next  days that hasnrsquot been possible in the last two and a half years.ldquoIt is time for everyone to get real, the country is facing a Brexit clf-edge, we cant carry on limping towards it oblivious to the reality.The FM denied the Salmond row had knocked back her expected announcement on a call for a second independence referendum, declaring: ldquoNot in the slightest, no, and explaining that she would make an announcement on the matter in the ldquonext matter of weeks.She added the Brexit crisis, ldquothe biggest in our letimes, made people in Scotland think thatthey were in charge of their affairs, ldquowe would perhaps be steering a better course right now we are in this position because we not independent.After a six-hour debate in the Commons, Tory MPs roared their approval when the vote numbers were read out.Mrs May responded to the result by making the invitation to the leaders of opposition parties, vowing to deliver on the \"solemn promise\" to deliver Brexit.During the debate, Mr Corbyn urged Mrs Mays \"zombie Government\" to make way and declared her \"Frankenstein\" Brexit deal was officially dead.He attacked Mrs May for presiding over \"the largest defeat in the history of our democracy\" on her Brexit deal and criticised the Governments record on issues beyond leaving the EU.But the Labour faced Tory taunts with former minister Anna Soubry labelling him the \"most hopeless Leader of the Opposition weve ever had\".The PM rose to cheers and the stamping of feet from her backbenchers and told Mr Corbyn a general election would be \"the worst thing we could do\".She said: \"It would deepen ision when we need unity, it would bring chaos when we need certainty, and it would bring delay when we need to move forward, so this House should reject this motion.\"At this crucial moment in our nations history, a general election is simply not in the national interest.\"Mrs May also launched a personal attack on Mr Corbyn, noting: ldquoWhat he has done to his party is a national tragedy.

Right from the very start, when the decision to hold an EU referendum was made, this Brexit project has been all about seeking - and failing - to placate the feuding factions of the Tory party. Nothing  has mattered, certainly not the jobs or livelihoods of people in Scotland or the UK.:Herald poll: Scotland should have independence referendum after BrexitThere has been no attempt to bring people together to seek consensus, despite a clear commitment to do so, or to recognise the narrow nature of the Leave vote across the UK, let alone the  per cent Remain vote in Scotland.The sheer scale of the Prime Ministerrsquos historic defeat does not seem to have registered with her but the nature of that loss means the whole approach of the UK Government has to change. I, and the new First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, have asked for an urgent meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee.But more importantly there needs to be a fundamental re-think of the way the UK Government does business. Rather than being in the lecturing business, the Prime Minister needs to be in the listening business. Instead of seeking to bulldoze through unacceptable proposals she has to take on board the views of others.There is no prospect whatsoever of the Prime Ministerrsquos current deal being passed at the second attempt. That deal would make us poorer, it would drag Scotland out of not just the EU but the Customs Union and Single Market - which is eight times the size of the UK alone - hitting jobs and living standards.It would put us at a competitive disadvantage compared with Northern Ireland and it would almost certainly lead to a fall in Scotlandrsquos working population because of the Prime Ministerrsquos anti-immigration obsession. It would mean years of further damaging uncertainty as a vague political declaration will only provide more fuel for the internal disagreements within the Government.:David Mundell faces fresh calls to resign over Brexit voteTherefore a proper plan is needed. In the discussions the Prime Minister says she wants to have with other parties, and the devolved governments, we will be making it clear what we believe needs to happen.The first step that must be taken is to rule out No Deal. This outcome, so beloved of the hard Brexiteers in the Tory Party, must be taken off the table. Disgracefully the threat of No Deal has been used by the Prime Minister in an attempt to force MPs to accept her deal. That threat must now be removed.The second step is to stop the clock on Brexit. The Prime Minister still seems unable to face up the urgency of the situation with the UK due to leave the EU in less than three monthsrsquo time.So Theresa May must immediately write to the EU asking to extend the Article  process and take the steps provided for in the EU Withdrawal Act to remove March  as the date for the UKrsquos exit. An extension would require the unanimous support of the EU  which means there is no more time to waste.And thirdly, now that the Prime Minister has limped through a vote of no confidence, with a general election unlikely, legislation must also be brought forward to hold a second referendum on EU membership with the option for Remain on the ballot paper.A second referendum would not guarantee that Scotlandrsquos wishes will prevail, although SNP members would seek to amend any legislation with a ldquofour-nation lock so that the UK could only leave with the agreement of all the UKrsquos nations.The only way to ensure that democratic guarantee, of course, is for Scotland to be an independent country.One of the most instructive and revealing aspects of the period since the Brexit vote is the contrast between the way Ireland has been treated by the EU and the contempt with which Scotland has treated by the Westminster government.Ireland has received solidarity and support from all its EU partners, while our national interests are ignored, the powers of the Scottish Parliament are eroded and we are left at the mercy of an increasingly dysal and chaotic Westminster system.Indeed the costs to Scotland of not being independent have never been clearer.But whatever Scotlandrsquos constitutional future, it will be in all our interests for the UK to have the closest possible relationship with Europe, and it is time to put the question of EU membership to the people again.Nicola Sturgeon is First Minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP"},{"url":null,"title":"ive-now-being-seen-as-james-nesbitts-delusional-cold-feet-character","story":"I could reveal more of the comments that question my sanity, integrity and talent this past week, as a result of the column \"Do women lose their sexuality at  \" But the point to mentioning the social media sandblasting is to say I canrsquot really be too upset when Annie Brown of the Record cites my cellulite, or when Radio Three music journalist and Herald contributor Kate Molleson labels me a misogynist.For two reasons the first is this week sees the Scottish Law Commissionrsquos recommendations on defamation law being debated, the Government hoping to ensure a balance between freedom of expression and the protection of an inidualrsquos reputation.

The most obvious way would be for the Government to table a simple stand-alone Bill, as was the case for the  referendum. However, Prime Minister Theresa May has made clear she is firmly opposed to the idea.: Herald poll: Scotland should have independence referendum after BrexitAn alternative route could be for MPs to try to amend another piece of relevant legislation.- How long would it take In the case of the  referendum, it took seven months to get the Bill through Parliament - although in practice it could be done much more quickly.The Electoral Commission then has a statutory duty to assess the referendum question to ensure it is intelligible and free from bias - a process which would normally take up to  weeks, although again it could be shortened.The legislation would specy theof the referendum campaign. All recent campaigns have lasted at least  weeks.Overall, the Institute for Government estimates the whole process could take up to five months.- What would that mean for the Brexit timetable On current plans, Britain is due to leave the EU on March , so it could not be completed by then.Therefore, for a referendum to be held, the Government would have to go to Brussels to ask for an extension to the Article  withdrawal process - something the EU may or may not grant.- What would be the question on the ballot paper This is where it gets complicated.Generally, referendums offer a simple choice between two options - as in  when it was Leave or Remain. However, most MPs accept that there would have to be at least three options - leave with a deal, leave without a deal, or remain in the EU.- How would that work Various ideas have been floated.One would be for voters to rank the options in order of preference. If none of the options gained an overall majority of first preference votes, the one with the fewest votes would be eliminated and its second preference votes would be distributed among the other two.:Theresa Mays Brexit deal suffers historic Commons defeatAlternatively, voters could just be given one choice. If none received an overall majority, the one with the fewest votes would again be eliminated, but under this scheme the other two options would then go forward to a final ballot a week later.A third way could be to have a two-question ballot. The first would askvoters wanted to Leave or Remain. The second would ask them to choose between a deal and a no-deal Brexit in the event that there is still a majority for Leave.- Where do the political parties stand The Conservatives officially oppose a second referendum, arguing that voters made their views clear in  and that another ballot would simply exacerbate the bitter isions opened up by the Brexit debate.However, a growing number of mainly Remain-supporting backbench Tory MPs are warming to the idea, believing it offers a way out of the current impasse.Labour says it wants a general election, butthat is not possible all options are on the table - including a second referendum.Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a longstanding Eurosceptic, has, however, shown little enthusiasm for the idea, while some of his supporters fear it could alienate traditional Labour voters in Leave-supporting areas.However, he is facing a groundswell of support from within the party for another vote, including from many of the young Momentum activists who propelled him to the leadership and who are passionately opposed to Brexit.Scotlands First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the SNP - which opposes Brexit - will back a second referendum in the Commons.- Are there any precedents for a second referendum In the UK, not really. However in other countries, where referendums are more common, there is a history of giving voters a chance to think again.In Ireland, for example, in  voters supported ratication of the EU Lisbon Treaty, having rejected it at the first time of asking.Similarly, in , the Irish voted for the Nice Treaty on the second occasion."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-wont-waste-time-talking-to-may-unless-pm-moves-on-brexit","story":"The First Minister said there was no point in talking to the Prime Ministershe stuck rigidly to her existing red lines, regardless of the landslide defeat of her Brexit deal on Tuesday.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford held a preliminary talk with Mrs May on Wednesday evening, but told her he could not enter a full discussion without concessions.:Nicola Sturgeon: Itrsquos time to put the question of Europe to people againMs Sturgeon wants Mrs May to rule out a No Deal Brexit, extend the Article  withdrawal process, and to consider a Peoplersquos Vote.Scottish Secretary David Mundell told BBC Radio Scotland this morning that ldquoeverything was on the table for cross-party talks.However Mr Mundell also excluded ldquoarrangements that seek to stop Brexit, including a Peoplersquos Vote.Ms Sturgeon responded in a tweet: ldquoSo everything is not on the table.

He was probably thinking I was going to mention Taxi Driver or Raging Bull or Goodfellas, but then I said that King of Comedy was the one that really got me interested in film-making and he instantly became engaged on a really intense level.ldquoI donrsquot think many people pick that out as one of his best movies.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Colin Clark MP, UK Government Minister Lord Duncan and cllr Gillian Owen at the opening event\"  New centre opened in BalmedieviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"David Cook , Cllr Gwyneth Petrie, Cllr Gillian Owen, Cllr Anne Simpson, Cllr Anne Allan, Cllr Iris Walker and Cllr Anne Stirling \"  , Cllr Gwyneth Petrie, Cllr Gillian Owen, Cllr Anne Simpson, Cllr Anne Allan, Cllr Iris Walker and Cllr Anne Stirling \"  Unit to breathe new le into council services viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"ldquoFrom that moment, he kind of took me under his wing and ever since then, whenever I go to New York I go round to his house and wersquoll have a cup of tea or Irsquoll go to the edit and hersquoll show me stuff from the latest film hersquos been working on. It is like a boyhood dream.Of course, Scorsese is also a walking encyclopaedia of film history, so the fact that Baird has made a film about arguably the greatest cinematic comedy double act of all time must have made him a good person to have in his corner. ldquoHe did mentor me on Stan  Ollie, confirms Baird, who specically sought his technical advice on how to shoot the moviersquos dazzling opening scene: an extended one-take tracking shot following Laurel and Hardy at the peak of their career as they walk through a studio backlot in .ldquoWe only had one day to shoot that because we were in Pinewood and Star Wars had taken all the stages, says Baird. ldquoIt was unbelievable. ldquoWe planned it like a military operation.If the sequence owes something to the cinematic craft of the Copacabana nightclub scene in Scorsesersquos Goodfellas, it also feels like a sly homage to the opening shot of Robert Altmanrsquos Hollywood satire The Player, immediately setting this up as more of a bittersweet look at what happens to movie stars when the glare of the spotlight fades.When Stan  Ollie cuts to  years later, for instance, the protagonists are in a very dferent place.Fondly remembered by the public, but out of step with contemporary tastes, theyrsquore unable to secure even aphone call from producers as they embark on what feels, at first, like a grin-and-bear-it tour of Britainrsquos regional music halls, performing their old routines up and down the country, including in Glasgow, where the Lancashire-born Stan Laurel spent the latter part of his childhood and secured his first professional gig, aged , at the Panopticon.ldquoI didnrsquot really know about Laurelrsquos connection to Scotland until I started doing this film, says Baird, who has fond memories of his own childhood love of watching Laurel and Hardy films on TV in the late s and early s.ldquoTherersquos a picture of me as an eight year-old that my mum still has of me dressed as Stan Laurel at the school fancy dress party, he says.The enduring appeal of Laurel and Hardy is something the filmrsquos melancholic plot zeroes in on and though Reillyrsquos performance is justly winning the lionrsquos share of the acclaim, Cooganrsquos take on Laurel as the quiet, professionally-minded workhorse is perhaps the more relatable.It certainly seems more applicable to Bairdrsquos own career. Having grown up in a fishing town with no family connection to the arts world , he kept his own film-making ambitions secret, moving to London and working in telesales until a friend who worked for a newspaper tipped him off to an entry level job at a production company about to be advertised in the recruitment section.ldquoHe told them there was no space to run it that week and gave me the number. ldquoSo I phoned them up, had an interview, got the job and started the next week, by which point the advert had run and they got  applications.ldquoI know, because I had to st through all the mail!Even now, it still feels like becoming a director was a bit of a pipe dream.ldquoBut I think that made me work a lot harder. I had to. It was either work hard and put everything into it or it was never going to happen. ldquoSo Irsquom glad now, but there were a lot of dark days getting here.Jonrsquos formative years were spent in Peterhead. Educated at the local academy, he worked for his fatherrsquos roofing company and ndash like so many other young loons ndash also worked at the port.He even did work experience at the Buchanie!Despite all this, however, he harboured dferent ambitions ndash he wanted to see his name in lights.In an interview with the Buchanie in , he said: ldquoMy uncle lived in Hampshire and we used to visit him twice a year. On the way we would stop in London and go to a theatre production, usually a musical. My dad used to love musicals. By the age of  Irsquod seen everything ndash you name it Irsquod seen it.ldquoWhen I came out of those theatre productions I had this incredible euphoria. I thought when I was older I want to do something that makes people feel like that. ldquoPeterhead is not a place you can really come from and do that. Itrsquos not achievable.

Discussions on the future of the service were scheduled to take place in November but were delayed to allow extra time to take residentsrsquo views into account - proposed service changes have been amended as a result.Proposals to close the Insch Household Waste and Recycling Centrehave been removed as a result of public feedback. It is proposed that the centre would stay open two days a week, with the cost to be covered by slightly shortening opening hours at other recycling centres.Changes to kerbside services have also been proposed and, out of the two options consulted on, councillors are recommended to choose the option which will give residents a  litre non-recyclable waste bin to be emptied every three weeks. Paper card and metals, cartons and plastics recycling bins would also be incorporated into the -weekly collection cycle, together with a weekly food waste collection. Although a dferent option was more popular in the consultation, professional advice is that the alternative is most likely to encourage residents to recycle more and send less waste to landfill.By increasing recycling the proposed change is expected to reduce service costs by at least £, per year, money which will be reinvested into other essential council services.It is also proposed to double the number of seasonal garden waste collection points, with new facilities in locations including Balmedie, Kemnay, Kintore, Mintlaw, Newmachar and Oldmeldrum.Aberdeenshirersquos current recycling rate is only .%, but the services currently available to residents should allow over % of waste to be recycled.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Thursday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Following on from its four other adaptations of children’s classics, as well as pantomimes and avant-garde entries to the SCDA festival, the group has decided to stage a musical version of Arthur Ransome’s well-known book Swallows and Amazons.Developed for the famous Bristol Old Vic theatre, it tells the story of four rather straight-laced children on holiday in the s, given permission, in those pre-risk assessment days, to take a dinghy out onto the lake with their father’s warning not to be “duffers,” in other words, just to be sensible. They soon get their sense of adventure heightened when they meet the fierce Amazon pirates, otherwise the Blackett sisters, Nancy and Peggy. After a brief “battle of the boats” on the lake, they decide to wage another war against the Blacketts’ Uncle Jim, soon to be renamed “Captain Flint,” simply because he has spent the summer writing a boring book and isn’t a fun uncle any more. That, and a mysterious burglary, makes for an exciting, funny and absorbing play, with a surprise at every turn.The story is great fun, all the more so since the production uses a number of clever devices to turn everyday household objects into boats, rocks, weapons and everything  needed to tell the story. The cast, made up of actors ranging in age from  to  plus, have enjoyed creating their characters and learning the very catchy songs with this year#s musical director Glenys Hughes.Soyou want to see how a hall can be turned into a lake without flooding it, Deerness Dram Group encourage you to come along on February ,  or  and join in the fun!

I realise that the build up in favour of Michael Ross, trying to prove his innocence, has given the book another layer — whether it’s correct or not. I was shocked that there had never been a book on it, but I think that’s because it’s over such a long time period.”On the evening of June , , Bangladeshi waiter Shamsuddin Mahmood was shot dead at the Mumutaz restaurant in Bridge Street, sparking a full-scale murder investigation. Though questioned at the time, it was another  years before Michael Ross was apprehended for the crime. On June , , Mr Ross was convicted of murder at the High Court in Glasgow. Last year, he admitted attempts to escape HM Prison Shotts, where he is currently serving a -year sentence. This came shortly after news that high-profile lawyer Aamar Anwar would be representing him in an appeal case.“It’s an incredible story,” added Mr Clarkson.“I think it’s one of the most extraordinary true crime stories in UK criminal history.”Having already secured a book deal, Mr Clarkson has long-term aspirations of bringing the story to Netflix which he says, has shown interest in making a six-part series about the case. For now, he is trying to get folk who were involved in the case, or who knew Shamsuddin Mahmood or Michael Ross, personally, to come forward.“I’m really interested in speaking to witnesses who were in the restaurant, to Michael’s ex-girlfriend, and to anyone who knew Shamsuddin when he was living here in Orkney,” he explained.“To be fair to the people who are fighting for his innocence, they deserve a voice as well, and they will get a voice in my book, because what I’m trying to do is look at it from all angles. I also want to make sure that Michael Ross’s family get the right to reply.”If you have information which could be valuable to Mr Clarkson, you can contact him on  , or by emailing wensleyclarkson@yahoocopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She agreed to look at ways the Scottish Government may be able to help in identying potential options.Commenting after these exchanges, Mr McArthur said: “It remains a concern that Orkney continues to be without a local abattoir. I am very conscious that the longer this remains the case, the more dficult it will be to find a solution.“I welcome the cabinet secretary’s willingness to re-engage with the Council and other local stakeholders in Orkney in an attempt to make sure that all possible options are fully explored.

SSEN say these changes are aimed at improving the security of supply serving one of Orkney#s most remote islands, enhancing network resilience for the local community.The network operator has also installed new automation equipment on the network which allows SSEN’s teams to remotely operate switches, meaning power can be restored much quicker in the event of a power cut by remotely isolating the affected part of the network.Colin Rendall, SSEN’s Orkney Operations Manager, said: “The work on Sanday forms part of an ongoing commitment to target our investment towards improving network reliability in the areas with the greatest potential impact and improvement for our customers. We’re delighted to have completed this project on time and on budget, providing a more resilient, stronger electricity network for our customers on Sanday.“As a responsible network operator, we worked closely with archaeologists and ecologists to ensure all works were completed in a responsible manner, with careful consideration for the local landscape and environment. We’d like to thank the local community for their support and patience during these works.”This work, delivering on one of SSEN’s business commitments, means the main network line serving  properties from Stove to the north end of Sanday has now been upgraded — resulting in a more resilient network for SSEN’s customers living and working on the island.Mobile generation was deployed throughout the duration of the project to minimise disruption to the island community, ensuring schools, shops, hotels and local businesses stayed on supply whilst SSEN’s engineers undertook this essential work.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He told the Ross-shire Journal: ldquoThis issue has rumbled on for some time and as the public interest shows, needs resolved quickly. I have written to Highland Councilrsquos director of community services, William Gilfillan, to ask that he attends a meeting with myself and other local community representatives.ldquoI am eager to get the community and the council round the table and thrash out the best way forward for Fighting Macrsquos monument. I have also written to the ward manager to request a site visit so I can see for myself the locally disputed health and safety concerns.More than  people have already signed a petition pressing Highland Council to take action. It states: ldquoThe time for excuses has passed, we have been let down far too often by officials.Its instigator, George Murray, who is leading moves for a business improvement district in the town, said he was delighted but not surprised by the public response.He said: ldquoThe council never understood the monument is more than just a local landmark with a nice view ndash in our area the MacDonald monument is a source of pride. The first man to ever make it from private to general in the history of the British army was a local from the Black Isle and people are proud of that history, why wouldnrsquot they be He said: ldquoWhat that shows is just how big the disconnect between the people and the council really is ndash I suspect its own officials are out of touch with the new chief executive, at least she listens.ldquoPeople are saying how they loved going up there as a child and how good it would be for education ndash the closure has really hurt the town.Dingwall Community Council chairman Jack Shepherd said support for the petition was a good indication of the strength of feeling towards getting the monument reopened.One who signed the petition, Iona McAuley,said: ldquoI used to love visiting the monument every Thursday evening with the Dingwall in Bloom group. I often take my children up to sit at the canons and tell them the story behind it. I have promised one day Irsquoll take them inside ndash hopefully in the near future.Another, Ireneusz Grochowski, said: ldquoIt would be great to see Dingwall from the top of the monument. I think it will be an amazing viewpoint for villagers and tourists.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoThe council has offered a community buyout and are waiting to hearthis is a proposal the group want to progress. We are following the findings of the health and safety report that highlighted a number of issues. Our insurance section has also advised us that the council would be unable to insure the monument for this public kind of use.The petition can be viewed at www.change.org p the-highland-council-open-the-hector-macdonald-monument-to-the-publicWhat do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupThursday  Jan  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"closure of tarbert ferry service to vehicles unavoidable say","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCalMac’s director of service has  described a planned temporary closure of the linkspan at Tarbert ferry terminal as “unavoidable disruption”.The operator has announced the vehicle service will be out of action for five days across February and March.

We are working with the team at CalMac and our contractor to ensure this work is carried out with as little disturbance to services as possible.”CalMac’s director of service delivery David Gibson said: “We have tried to build services around this unavoidable disruption as best we can to minimise the impact to communities during this period whilst the work is completed as quickly as is possible.”CalMac have advised that services for foot passengers will be provided during the disruption on normal service days on both routes. for details. of January.MEANWHILE, CalMac’s parent company David MacBrayne Limited has this week announced the appointment of Duncan Mackison as the group’s new chief executive officer.Mr Mackison, a former Royal Marine Commando Officer, comes into the role having recently held the post of Managing Director of Serco Defence.Service provider Serco had previously lost out to CalMac in their bid to operate Hebridean and Clyde ferries.In his position at Serco, Mr Mackison had responsibility for managing aviation and maritime contracts for the Ministry of Defence.This included the provision of vessels to provide maritime support to the Royal Navy."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/PORTREE-HEALTH-CHECK-4-Copy.jpg","title":"businessman set to embark on poseidon adventure in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAn iconic th-century building on Skye is set to be transformed into a -bedroom hotel called ‘Poseidon’, according to the owner of the building.that he planned to turn the building in Portree, known as the Black Memorial Hall, into a “modern hotel” boasting  bedrooms which he hoped to open by Christmas .The hotel will be called ‘Poseidon’ and will house  bedrooms with en-suite facilities, a bar, coffee area, and a two-bedroom self-catering flat.

However, I am delighted all of these hurdles have been overcome and I can’t wait for the work to get underway.”Originally submitted in  and , a spokesperson for Mr Ali said that the two applications pertaining to the development were delayed due to theof time the Portree planners took to reply to his architect#s letter regarding the ratication of the Conditions in the Listed Building Consent and Planning Permission.In response to those comments, Councillor John Gordon said: “Planning for the proposal was granted on th September , and Listed Building Consent was given on th September .“Given this, I am disappointed at how long it has taken for these plans to be taking forward since then, but I welcome the progress that is now being made.” that work on the ‘Poseidon’ hotel will begin in March.Article by Adam Gordon"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8768911.1547477230!/image/image.jpg","title":"antrim emergency department under extreme pressure","story":"The Northern Health and Social Care Trust has issued advice to residents as  people continue to wait for beds at Antrim Area Hospital.

Violence is endemic, paramilitary groups continue their activity, we have had numerous years when no local government was possible, and the Assembly hasn’t sat for the last two years.”Mr O’Loan’s remarks sparked a strong reaction from Ian Paisley, who said nationalist rhetoric “can only surviveit talks down the Union and NI”. The North Antrim DUP MP told the News Letter that the “continuous campaign of terror” waged by the IRA had “stunted the economic growth” of Northern Ireland.“It is convenient for nationalists to ignore this as their ideology benighted from its consequences,” he added. “Despite the  years of terror, NI has survived, now boasts the lowest levels of unemployment in our history, the highest levels of inward investment outside of London and is a hub for many key businesses. Nationalism survives on a dialogue of talking down NI hence I am not surprised by such comments.”Charges withdrawn against man accused of pointing gun at Orange paradeTree-mendous recycling efforts Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8762003.1546953788!/image/image.jpg","title":"tree mendous recycling efforts","story":"The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim has thanked residents who are #treecycling# after Christmas.In the run-up to the festive season, the council encouraged citizens to recycle unwanted items and responsibly dispose of all waste, including Christmas trees.And Mayor Lindsay Millar said she has been impressed by the number of people visiting Household Recycling Centres in order for their trees to be turned into high-quality compost for our parks and gardens in Mid and East Antrim.Cllr.

But unfortunately it is the residents who are suffering from the impact of all of this.“Depending on the direction of the wind the smell can be so bad it makes me feel nauseous and sometimes you just want to get out of the area to get some fresh air.“You cant hang out clothes, open your windows or sit in your garden. It affects your well-being because you are always thinking how long am I going to have to live with this or will I have to sell-up, leave the home that I have put a lot of effort into and have lived in for many years  The possible health implications are also a major concern.”She continued: “It is not just me there are residents in the area who have farms or homes that have been in their families for generations.“There are other issues as well as the odour and I feel like we are the guinea pigs in all of this.“The company have told us they are working to fix the problem and we are meeting with them again on February .”One man who has lived in the area all his le but does not wish to be named, said he will have to think about movingthe situation does not improve.He stated: “The smell at times is terrible. It is a gassy smell but there is also a rotten smell to it, its hard to explain.“We cant open our windows even during the warm weather. We tried to have them open but I had to get up in the middle of the night to close them the smell was so bad.“Last summer when the weather was good everyone was out enjoying their gardens and having barbecues but we had to either sit in the house or go out to eat somewhere.”He continued: “We were told at the start that we would hear, smell or see nothing but that is not the case. “When the smell gets into the house it takes a long time for it to go. I have even had people saying they can smell it when they are driving along the Craigadoo Road and they ask me how do you stick it .“My we loves to garden but she cant because of the smell.

This is an issue which needs addressing and one which requires a Strategy, to be put in place.Whilst I like the idea of our local Assembly producing a strategy, it is vital that this statistic is reduced, drastically.”Ian’s we Beverley lost a family member over  years ago, through suicide. Beverley commented: “our family knows only too well the pain and heartache which family and friends endure, following such a tragic loss. For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  . The Samaritans volunteers provide a listening ear,  days per year and you can call them any hour of the day, or night,”If you are able to help out in any small way, by baking a few scones tray bakes or by just coming along to have a cuppa and a scone and to give a donation, the organisers will certainly appreciate your kindness.IN PICTURES: Dromore High opens its doors to prospective pupils Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8770151.1547557159!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"Dromore High School recently welcomed prospective pupils to the school.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

Why  Because De Gaulle called it right. England doesn’t belong in Europe, remains Atlanticist, attached to imperial preference, consumed by the ‘great-game’ of ide-and-rule, of balancing powers in Europe, never committed to “ever closer union”, focused on financial chicanery over agriculture and manufacturing. Was De Gaulle wrong  After the illusion of the Edward Heath era, Britain was only ever in Europe to disrupt it. That game is now up.Whether through opt-outs or rebates, through Maastrict and Lisbon, England’s subsequent conduct in Europe has been as drag-weight and chief saboteur. On reunication, Francois Mitterrand sought to bind Helmut Kohl’s Germany to deepen the European core. British diplomacy embraced Eastern Europe to widen, make shallow and reduce it to free-trading nations. England weighed in under Ireland’s Pat Cox’s cloak to undermine the Commission, the EU’s centre of gravity. And the Jacques Delors social-Europe of the s gave way, under English influence, to free-market liberalism.Things turned with the creation of the Euro. Decisions, increasingly, were taken by the Eurozone. The capacity to disrupt waned, the mileage for further meddling ran out. Whether Little-England or Global Britain, Brexit was the means to get out, to save its soul, or lose the sense of itself. Will England’s dficulty be Northern Ireland’s opportunity I hope so. Northern Ireland is a profoundly dysal polity. Alone in Europe we cannot elect thegovernment. We can’t vote Labour. Conservatives don’t seek a mandate here. We can’t elect the government and more importantly, we can’t chuck a bad government out.Voting in the Northern Ireland entity is like going into the bookies and being told you can back any horse you want – except the horses that might win. We can vote for losers all day long, but not winners. After  years of Northern Ireland, we remain a quarantined zone, the UK’s political slum. Local government is through a Stormont-based native-council, or what apartheid-era South Africans called a Bantustan. Well subsidised, maybe, but a Bantustan nonetheless.As a long-time campaigner to normalise politics within the UK, that avenue is long closed, over, dead. The Brexit vote has allowed us to throw the balls in the air. ‘Creative-chaos’, the policy wonks call it. Or Tony Blair’s prophetic words, to shake the kaleidoscope, and re-order our world. After a change of government, a hard Brexit will allow us to re-join Europe through a border-poll. A hard Brexit will allow us to join an independent Irish state, whose government we can, at least, elect. A border poll, for people like me, is a vote to get the vote # for the first time ever. I’d do that in a heartbeat.The Deltapoll online poll published in September  asked the question: “Imagine now that the UK decided to leave the EU. Under these circumstances how would you vote in a referendum on the constitutional arrangements of the island of Ireland ”More than half, %, said they would vote for a united Ireland, while % said they would vote for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK. In the event of a ‘hard’ Border, % said they would vote for unity, with only % voting to remain in the UK.The most recent Lucidpoll, published in December found, in the event of a ‘No-Deal’ Brexit, % would vote for unity, with only % to remain in the UK.These polling figures are unparalleled since partition.A hard Brexit will hasten the break up of the UK in other ways. Scotland will have a second independence vote, a second penalty kick to drt off, politically, towards Scandinavia. Whether they have the cojones to do so remains to be seen, but my vote for creative chaos gives them the chance.Hard Brexit will see the City of London diminish. The apex of an imbalanced economy, the ‘City’ is, effectively, a criminal paradise facilitating money-laundering, tax-evasion and the myriad dodgy financial products of predatory casino capitalism. Economists like the ’s Larry Elliot believe the shock-treatment of EU withdrawal could force Britain to focus on developing the real, productive, manufacturing base required to re-balance the economy. What’s not to like Whether Little England or Global Britain, the UK is splintering.And we, locked in the Northern Ireland entity, may soon be admitted to the franchise.

The renaming of the site, taking place on Saturday, is especially poignant as it is where Emma and Clara stood for decades in protest at human rights abuses and in memory of those fatally injured and killed by plastic bullets. Speaking ahead of the unveiling Relatives For JusticeDirector Mark Thompson said: “What these two women have given our community and achieved is remarkable and as a community, a society, a country, we have been privileged and blessed to have had them there for us all.”Mark added: “And it is this very combination of their work, humanity and humility, which they bring to that very vocation of standing up for rights when and where required that makes them stand out even though they’d be the first to shy away from such public accolades. “Emma Groves and Clara Reilly were also instrumental in establishing Relatives for Justice , our NGO, in April , ensuring that a holistic support and care package, from professional therapeutic counselling support for trauma survivors partnering a rights based advocacy casework approach for addressing human rights violations, framed our work. We stand on the shoulders of giants in the sense that ordinary people both made extraordinary sacrices and did extraordinary work at great personal risk in extraordinary times. “Their motto was simple, in that they paraphrased Edmund Burke, in saying ‘That evil can only flourish when good people remain silent.’ They refused to stay silent,” he said. Paul O’Connor from the Pat Finucane Centre described Emma Groves and Clara Reilly as “two lives of resistance”.“Two women who were leaders in their community –and Clara still is,” said Paul. “Many communities would be lucky to have had one of these indomitable fighters. Belfast and beyond had two but for the saddest of reasons. We say that Emma was ‘blinded by a rubber bullet’ in November  but she was actually blinded by a British soldier, a Para, who deliberately fired a rubber bullet at her face. “There wasn’t even an allegation that she was a phantom gunwoman or nail bomber. She simply refused to turn off the rebel songs she was playing in her own home. At some level the British Government must have regretted that day because Emma Groves went on to campaign, highlight, expose, denounce and bear witness to the dangers posed by rubber and plastic bullets in the following decades.“It is totally appropriate that the site of the former Andersonstown RUC barracks, scene of so many pickets with Emma and Clara, should now be renamed to honour these two strong working class women who did so much for others. “The chattering classes can keep their MBEs and CBEs. Clara and Emma are and were real heroes. And Relatives for Justice is a fitting tribute to all those years of dedication and struggle.”NI Amnesty Programme Director Patrick Corrigan recalled first meeting Emma Groves and Clara in the early s when “in Emma’s living room in Andersonstown, over a cup of tea, she told her harrowing story”.“Wearing her trademark dark glasses, she recounted the day in  when she lost the sight of both eyes after being shot in the face at point-blank range with a rubber bullet. Like so many stories from our recent conflict, Emma Groves’ inidual experience was of one of unwarranted violence and unnecessary pain.Clara Reilly and Emma Groves founded the United Campaign Against Plastic Bullets to bring together families bereaved or injured by rubber and plastic bullets and to end their use here and everywhere.“Campaigning by Emma Groves and Clara Reilly shone a light on the human rights abuses and suffering inflicted through use of the weapons, and inspired many to stand with them. They would later help found Relatives for Justiceand inspire its model of mutual support and advocacy.”Ancient Order of Hibernians’ Sean Pender added: “We are proud to add our voice to recognise Clara Reilly and Emma Groves as the community that they worked so hard and long for dedicates the junction of Falls, Glen and Andersonstown Road in their honour.“These two remarkable women stood strong and never wavered in their quest for justice and peace. The AOH was proud to have honoured Clara with its highest award, the Seán McBride humanitarian award, several years ago in recognition of her long history of civil and human rights work.“It is entirely appropriate that there will be an area that will forever recognise the work of these two great women.”The Groves, Reilly and Livingstone families are lelong friends and played prominent roles in the campaign to ban plastic bullets. Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone said: “It was a pleasure and a privilege to have known Emma and to know Clara. The line of placards on the road beside the barracks was and is a familiar August sight and my family can think of no better place and no better way to celebrate the inspirational lives of two amazing women.” The unveiling of Groves Reilly Corner will take place on Saturday January  at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"mps to vote on theresa mays brexit plan b on january 29 corbyn repeats call for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

to the “principles” behind the Withdrawal Agreement which was roundly rejected by MPs on Tuesday, including control of borders, laws and money and an independent trade policy.Aides later said that the requirement for an independent trade policy was incompatible with membership of a European customs union – something which Labour regards as essential.The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that Brussels was ready to respond to any revision of Mrs May’s “red line” demands, telling MPs in Portugal: “If they change, we’ll change.”Mr Barnier said that getting an agreement was “in everybody’s interest” and that “something has to change” to secure a orce deal.Shadow cabinet minister Barry Gardiner said Mrs May was clinging to her red lines because she knew that any compromise on them would “break the Conservative Party” by pushing eurosceptic backbenchers in the European Research Groupto desert her.“If she wants to negotiate with all parties in Parliament, andshe wants to do that in good faith, she has to say ‘OK, I’m not sticking to every single one of the red lines that I’ve established’,” he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain.I am disappointed that the leader of the

BBC Radio ’s Today: “If, in a moment of national crisis, the Prime Minister asks the Leader of the Opposition to come and talk, of course he should.”And Conservative chairman Brandon Lewis accused Labour of “trying to frustrate and avoid Brexit”.Mrs May has said that “the door remains open” to Labour for talks ahead of the deadline for her to present her Plan B to MPs on Monday.Her motion is expected to be amended by MPs seeking parliamentary support for a range of options, from ruling out no-deal to extending the two-year Article  process or calling a second referendum.The Commons will vote on the proposals on January , in a full day of debate expected to shed light on what Brexit solutions may be able to command a majority in Parliament.Mr Corbyn confirmed that Labour will table an

Amazing.— Kristan HeneageJanuary , Bielsa went on to introduce a presentation and some speculated it might contain reference to Derby manager Frank Lampard, who criticised Bielsa for the debacle which has become known as Spygate.Ahhh, panic over. 😅 #LUFC pic cWWxIOzKn— AlexJanuary , Instead though Bielsa’s Powerpoint contained extensive details of Derby’s tactics and style of play, as examples of the research done by the club on their opponents. The coach said he has information on every Championship player, including exactly how many minutes each player has played in ying positions, which drew admiration from many sports journalists.All the data on Harry Wilson is laid before us. He knew everything about the player who didn’t play Bielsa as planned this superbly. Masterclass in teaching a lot of lessons to a lot of people at the same time. #lufc pic rNJsQMgWsr— Adam PopeJanuary , Bielsa even said he once sent Pep Guardiola his dossier on Barcelona as a gt, to which the now Manchester City manager said he knew more about all his players than he did.Unsurprisingly then, people also believed Bielsa might know more about Derby than Lampard.Marcelo Bielsa knows more about Derby County than Frank Lampard. Pass it on.— We Are LeedsJanuary , Frank Lampard must be delighted: he made a big fuss about a guy in the bushes, and now Bielsa is revealing every single minute detail of Derbys tactics over the last two years via Powerpoint to the entire football world.— Daniel Edwards 💚January , Bielsa gave the presentation in Spanish with a translator, adding: “I can’t speak English but I can speak about the  teams in the Championship.”Marcelo Bielsa: \"I cant speak English but I can speak about the  teams in the Championship.\"Inject this into my veins. 😍 #LUFC— LUFCDATAJanuary , Despite Prime Minister Theresa May facing a vote of no confidence in the House of Commons, the Argentinian and his Powerpoint presentation was the top trending topic on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon.Many shrewdly suggested productivity in the city of Leeds may have stagnated during the presentation.Heres a nice graph outlining the work being done in Leeds over the last  minutes. #lufc pic sqOaCbrxYy— Mr GeldardJanuary , Indeed some thought Bielsa’s presentation was merely a distraction whilst his staff scouted Leeds’ next opponents, Stoke City.Genius from Bielsa - while everyone is at his press conference, his coaching staff are in Stoke getting ready for the weekend— Ben GoodwinJanuary , Bielsa completed his speech with something of a mic drop.Once Bielsa finished his presentation he turned to the room and said: “Thank you for listening. Goodbye.” Proceeded to open the door and walk out. About as close to a mic drop as it gets. #lufc— Joe UrquhartJanuary , After the press conference, BBC journalist Adam Pope shared a video of stacks of files Bielsa had laid out, filled with data on Leeds’ opponents.Bielsa’s light reading #lufc pic oRspXBB— Adam PopeJanuary , All in all, Bielsa made quite the impression on football fans.This is Marcelo Bielsa’s world, we’re all just living in it.— MattyJanuary , Strong words."},{"url":null,"title":"europe prepares for nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We could all learn so much from him.Cllr Walker said he hoped those who targeted Ryanrsquos cookie box would realise the error of their ways and stop again outside the young manrsquos home to pay for the food they took.ldquoWhat happened in the dead of night outside Ryanrsquos home is a sad reflection on those responsible. If they do not pay for the goods. I hope they can be identied so the authorities can have a word, he continued.Cllr Walker, who, along with his Rowallane counterpart Terry Andrews, organises several charity events each year, hopes that his  itinerary will allow him to raise some for Ryan which he can donate to a charity of his choice.He added: ldquoRyan is a shining example to us all. He works hard to help others and it is deeply upsetting that there are those in the community who would target of all things an honesty box.

He has used everything from boards, wooden planks, old suitcases, football tops and even an old Belfast sink for his masterpieces.Aidan, who is often seen at home in his studio with a paintbrush in hand and his six week-old baby daughter Siacutene lying across his shoulder, says he has loved drawing all his le.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until  that I took a career break from my job as a civil servant to look after my young family and try to turn my passion for art into a career, he remarked.ldquoSo far it is going from strength to strength.

Then I began to produce portraits of people with pencil, and my we encouraged me to try painting them a few years ago.ldquoI am Loughinisland, through and through. This has actually inspired one of the pieces of artwork that will be on display. The exhibition gives an insight into my depiction of growing up in Northern Ireland post-troubles.ldquoIt contains many animals from Northern Ireland, but I have also reflected on some things such as landscapes, political figures and events that had some sort of impact on me when I was growing up.ldquoWhen I was in primary school I loved art and I kept a booklet from P where I said that I wanted to grow up to be an artist.

They were unbelievable and were really pioneering.Naturally delighted with the honour mdash the first in her family mdash Mrs Roulston says that she shares it with a lot of people.ldquoThroughout my career, I have worked alongside so many wonderful and dedicated people, committed to making a dference to the lives of the children and to ensuring that they received the very best possible education in the widest sense of the word mdash teachers, assistants, dinner ladies, caretakers, volunteer parents and members of the board of governors, etc, she said.ldquoSo, on the day that I receive my MBE, I will be paying honour to all the people I have known and worked with and all those from other schools and sectors who show dedication and commitment to the children in our schools.The little people who she had the pleasure of teaching until she retired in  will always have a special place in  year-old Mrs Roulstonrsquos heart.ldquoI would like to thank all the children, those I have taught and also those whom I had the pleasure of knowing for all that they have taught me, for the pleasure they have given me throughout my career, for all the funny things they said or did which brightened up my day, for their kindness to me in all the drawings and little hand-made crafts they made for me.Originally from outside Manchester, Mrs Roulston has lived and worked in the south Down area from the late s after marrying her husband, Mervyn.After teaching practice in England and teaching in two very dferent schools in France, Mrs Roulston taught for some years in Greyabbey and Portavogie Primary Schools, as well as the Rupert Steiner School in Belfast, before taking a career break while raising her three sons mdash John, Peter and Timothy mdash in Kircubbin.ldquoI did a lot of cross-community work at that time as chair of the parent and toddler group, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoI also formed and chaired a community association and did a lot of work together cross community to get facilities for Kircubbin. It wasnrsquot a paid job but it was an important part of everything and I believe itrsquos where I first understood that cross-community work was so important.While working in Portaferry Primary School in the late s, she was fascinated on learning about a group of parents in Carryduff campaigning for an integrated primary school.ldquoI was reading all about it in the local newspaper and it was very interesting to me, but it was hot and heavy as well as there was lot of objection to the school, she said.ldquoI never dreamt that I would apply for it or have anything to do with it. But I did apply as it was a teaching principalship and it was working with both sides of the community as all the work I had done with cross-community work just kept saying to me, lsquoThis is really important work, this needs to be done to break down barriersrsquo.The road to establishing Millennium was far from smooth, however, as the grandmother of three can testy.ldquoYou just wouldnrsquot believe the terrible trouble we had and itrsquos hard to believe now what happened, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoDays before we were due to open, I had  primary ones and no funding and no site as there was a lot of opposition to establishing the school where we had originally planned to in the Carryduff area.ldquoWe ended up down at Breda Park, close to Forestside in Belfast in an old heath trust building. We initially rented it for six months but ended up staying for two yearsldquoWe were in a very derelict, vandalised, dirty building which we all very quickly had to work very hard get it up to scratch for the children.ldquoWe all had to break down barriers in many areas.Together with P classroom assistant, Mrs Marie Coiley, who still works at Millennium, they began to establish a school with an emphasis on total inclusiveness from the start.ldquoIt was very important to me that the school would be child-centred and the children would have a voice, explained Mrs Roulston.ldquoIt would not only be integrated in the whole Catholic-Protestant area but integrated at every level and it would be highly inclusive and children of all abilities and backgrounds would be welcome.After dficult early years in the Breda Park site, she believed that the school finally turned a corner when it secured a site in Carryduff to build around mobile classrooms in its third year.ldquoI always knew it was going to work, I knew it was needed and I knew that I was determined and the others around me were also very determined, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoIrsquove always been a very determined person and Irsquove alway never liked inequality or injustice of any kind.ldquoIt was very important to me that it happened and I was surrounded by some amazing parents who eventually became the board of governors.Shersquos rightly proud of her achievements and adds: ldquoI know I did good work.ldquoI must say there were days when myself and Mrs Coiley would often look around during assembly at all the children and all of the staff and wonder how did we get here.Now a director of the Integrated Education Fund, Mrs Roulstonrsquos hope for the future is to see a planned integrated school.ldquoIntegrated education is a growth area and I would like to see a situation the Department of Education and the Education Authority actually decide to plan an integrated school and not to be relying on parents having to fight for them.ldquoAll our grant maintained integrated schools have had horrendous journeys to succeed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Tally’s Down torment continues  ","story":"DOWN fell to their second successive McKenna Cup defeat when Donegal proved too strong for Paddy Tallyrsquos side in front of just over , spectators at Pairc Esler on Sunday.The Down manager made several changes from the side that started against Cavan as he continues in his bid to unearth some fresh talent, but it was Donegal and their new faces that impressed.The visitors registered the first score when Niall OrsquoDonnell converted in the first minute.

As a result, Castle Park will have provision for a number of motorhomes which are welcome to park up overnight and enjoy what Newcastle has to offer.Cllr Devlin said the provision of the new spaces at both parks will be completed in advance of the new barriers being erected to ensure that there is no gap in provision.She thanked council officials involved in addressing the motorhome issue and is pleased local authority officials plan to speak with representatives from the motorhome community to see what more can be done for them.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoThere is an acceptance that motorhomes contribute to the local economy and that needs to be encouraged and supported where possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/farming/resources/images/4523134.jpg","title":"outstanding quality at second calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

MPs will vote on an amendment that will “pave the way for the Bill”, the paper said.DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson, whose party came to the Prime Minister’s rescue on Wednesday by helping her survive a no confidence vote, warned that the Government would be “absolutely stark raving mad” to revoke Article .He told the News Letter: “Take no-deal off the table and you have removed another advantage that the PM could have in what are going to be very tough negotiations with the EU to try and get the withdrawal agreement changed.“She is facing an uphill struggle at the moment as it is. The EU have said they don’t intend to move on the withdrawal agreement, they don’t intend to give any concessions. “What leverage does she then haveshe removes March  from the table  With her deal being so heavily defeated at Parliament, she can now go back and attempt to force some concessions from Brussels over the backstop.”The East Antrim MP added that to remove the option of a no-deal would infuriate Brexiteers within her own party. Mr Wilson continued: “If she thought the rebellion within the Tory party over the withdrawal agreement was bad, the problems she would faceshe removes the date for leaving the EU would be even worse. It would be taken as a signal that she had given up on leaving the EU, because in effect that is what she would be doing.”A Treasury spokesman confirmed the conference call – which consisted of senior business figures such as Doug Gurr, head of Amazon UK and John Allan, chairman of Tesco and president of the CBI – took place shortly after the vote on Tuesday, but would not confirm any details.Appeal for mystery couple who reported womans assault - to again contact policeSectarian and hate-fuelled graffiti removed, say SDLP Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendN.I. issued with severe weather warning - ice and wintry showers due in next  hoursThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes fallsN.I. manwith dementia is missing - P.S.N.I. issue urgent appeal for help with dementia is missing - P.S.N.I. issue urgent appeal for help\"          ..

The only part which has been agreed by both the UK and the EU is the withdrawal agreement itself, and so that is the part that would be legally binding.”Mr Wilson also previously told this newspaper that the government could write its pledge to end the backstop within a year “in blood” and it would still not be enough for his party.However, Mr Shannon’s comments appear to indicate that,a time-limit to the backstop was written into the Withdrawal Agreement – a legally-binding international treaty – it could be enough to bring the DUP on board.Mr Shannon added that, by backing Mrs May in yesterday’s confidence vote in the House of Common’s, the DUP aimed to “strengthen her hand in negotiations with the EU to find a better deal”.“She claims to be a proud unionist. This is her chance to prove it by standing up for unionism and ensure there is no constitutional change for NI within the UK,” he said.Mr Shannon said he was surprised by the scale of Mrs May’s defeat in the Commons on Tuesday, and felt that by delaying the vote on her deal from its original date in December, the PM actually increased the margin of her defeat. He added: “The longer she delayed, the more time MPs had to think about her deal and became more and more unhappy with Mrs May’s strategy.“It was a calculated risk that she got spectacularly wrong.”try catch  TrendingN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendN.I. issued with severe weather warning - ice and wintry showers due in next  hoursThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes fallsPrisoner on the loose in N.I.          ..

Secretary , of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions We in Northern Ireland cannot afford to be sidelined while in Westminster decisions are being takenwhich will affect every family for decades to come. We need a new approach to mitigate the situation we have been forced into.While the commentariat, politicians and those of us leading representative organisations have been talking, planning and worrying about Brexit and its ramications for some time, the potential reality of a ‘No Deal’ Brexit is now beginning to be articulated in its most brutal form. Brexiteers argue this is scaremongering and it will be ‘alright on the night’. However, the reality is real uncertainty and this in itself creates a sense of chaos.As a trade unionist with many years’ experience of negotiations I have been struck by the coherence of the EU  under the lead negotiator Michel Barnier. The EU  is made up of governments on the centre right, the centre left and indeed the populist right. Countries from northern ‘protestant’ Europe and southern mediterranean ‘catholic’ Europe and the ‘newer’ eastern European member states.Countries with ying political cultures and traditions. Contrast this with the incoherent and inconsistent approach of the Tory party, where on this issue of Brexit, there are a number of Tory parties. Regrettably, the opposition Labour party seems equally ided on this critical issue of our time.In Northern Ireland, ato devolution seems as far away as ever.Stormont has been in abeyance for two years with the people suffering the practical consequences of this limbo.The Brexit debate here in political circles seems to be limited to the rhetoric of orange and green, with some notable exceptions.Lord Empey: Dublin has failed to work with London on Brexit and is over reaching, as it has done in the pastThe government ought now to have some confidence Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The draft Withdrawal Agreement which commentators have lazily been describing as ‘Mrs May’s deal’was rejected last night largely because of ‘British’ political concerns and clearly has not taken into account the overall impact a ‘No Deal’ Brexit would have on these islands politically, economically, socially and culturally.The Irish Congress of Trade Unionswhich organises and represents , workers across the island through our  affiliate trade unions came to the reluctant conclusion at our executive meeting in November  that the deal should,be supported. We did so not on the basis that this proposal, while clearly inferior to the status quo , would do less harm to workers in Ballymena and Belfast and Dublin and Cork, than a ‘No Deal’ Brexit.It now remains to be seenthe UK political establishment has the capacity and indeed the wit to get its act together and avoid what the majority of politicians and those of us who also represent real people in representative organisations want, which is an agreement between the UK and EU .In Northern Ireland there has been much comment in recent times about business groups and farmers speaking out. The trade union movement has always spoken out .There is a new assertiveness to the representatives of civil society, which is welcome.I believe it is crucial now that under strand  of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, that the UK and Irish governments establish a representative Northern Ireland Brexit Stakeholder Forum without delay which includes the trade union movement , the key business groups, the farming community and the community and voluntary sector. These four pillars represent the overwhelming majority of citizens in Northern Ireland society.Deal or no deal,Brexit does occur on the th March  there will be major issues impacting on Northern Ireland and its people some foreseen some unforeseen. We must seek to address these issues collectively and in a considered manner.We want Stormont to . We have always been and remain supporters of devolution. But we cannot wait any longer, our voices need to be articulated, heard and heeded in a coherent way.Such a Brexit stakeholder’s forum is not in any way proposed as a substitute for devolution. Politicians are elected and accountable to their electorate and have a mandate. Such a forum that I am proposing would actually complement devolution, when andit s. But we cannot wait as the th March  is  days away and the clock is ticking. We need to act now.• Owen Reidy is ICTU assistant general secretary JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8773649.1547732077!/image/image.jpg","title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics      Brexit: Taking no-deal option off the table lsquobonkersrsquoA DUP MP has labelled Chancellor Philip Hammond as #totally bonkers# after he reportedly told business leaders that a no-deal Brexit could be #taken off the table# and Article  #rescinded#.

The alarm was raised by her friends, and they, together with members of the public and a Penarth RNLI volunteer, helped to keep her safe before the leboat was launched.A throw line was used to reach the casualty, and lejackets were obtained from the leboat station.The ywoman was struggling to hold on, and with high spring tides the RNLI crew member entered the water to fit her lejacket and support her, knowing that the leboat crew had been paged and were on their way.The D-class leboat was launched quickly, and brought the casualty and the Penarth crew member safely back to the station.A medical check was carried out on both, and although cold and wet they were deemed fit and well.Jason Dunlop, Penarth RNLI Leboat Operations Manager paid tribute to all those involved: \"With such a high tide, in darkness and in cold water, the casualty could have easily drted out of sight. By hanging on as she did and with the support of everyone involved the rescue was affected quickly and safely.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There has to be a discussion about the options that we put forward and wersquove put forward the three options that Irsquove outlined.Jeremy Corbyn was applauded when he said all options, including a second referendum, remained open Mr Corbyn is now the only Westminster party leader who has not held discussions with Mrs May, after she held out an olive branch across the Commons on Wednesday.Speaking in the heart of an East Sussex constituency that voted %-% in favour of Leave in , he said: ldquoLast nightrsquos offer of talks with party leaders turned out to be simply a stunt, not the serious attempt to engage with the new reality that is needed.He added: ldquoI say to the Prime Minister again: I am quite happy to talk but the starting point for any talks about Brexit must be that the threat of a disastrous no-deal outcome is ruled out, taken off the table, and we can talk about the future of the plans that we will put forward and the future relationship with Europe.A reporter who asked Mr Corbyn whether other Labour MPs were also barred from meeting Mrs May or other Ministers was met with audible discontent from Labour activists.Labour MP John Mann leaving the Cabinet Office A smiling John Mann, a Leave-supporting Labour MP and long-term critic of Mr Corbyn, was spotted coming out of the Cabinet Office in Whitehall at around .pm, an hour after the leaderrsquos speech.Mr Corbyn said he had written to the Prime Minister on Thursday setting out his position.He confirmed that Labour will table amendments to Mondayrsquos motion, putting forward its preferred solution of a customs union with a voice for the UK in future EU trade deals, a close single market relationship and protections for rights.He held open the possibility of an extension of the Article  negotiation period, saying: ldquoQuite clearly,no agreement has been reached within the time it could be implemented by the end of March, the issue of extending the exit date, extending Article , does come into play.ldquoIndications are that that may well be the case..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Corbyn blasts May Brexit talks  ustunt u, as activists applaud new referendum talk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The YouGov survey for the Peoplersquos Vote campaign, conducted after Mrs Mayrsquos Brexit plan went down to humiliating defeat in the House of Commons on Tuesday, put Remain on % against % for Leave.Peoplersquos Vote supporter Chuka Umunna said the poll showed that more thanthree-quarters of Labour voters back a referendum, warning Mr Corbyn: ldquoTo ignore those calls now would be an historic mistake for which Labour would not be forgiven.A Conservative ldquoRight to Vote campaign for a second EU referendum was launched by MP Phillip Lee, who claimed support for a so-called Peoplersquos Vote was ldquogrowing fast among his colleagues on the Tory benches.Proud to launch #RightToVote with my amazing colleagues: @heidiallen, @SamGyimah, @GutoAberconwy, @Anna_Soubry, @JustineGreening, @sarahwollaston  Dominic Grieve. #RightToVote is a new home for #Conservatives in favour of giving the people the #FinalSay on #Brexit pic uoacYPurmdash Dr Phillip Lee MPJanuary , Mrs May invited MPs and leaders from across the Commons for talks to find a way forward on Brexit after fighting off a no-confidence motion on Wednesday.But she told the House of Commons she was holding to the ldquoprinciples behind the Withdrawal Agreement which was roundly rejected by MPs on Tuesday, including control of borders, laws and money and an independent trade policy.Aides later said that the requirement for an independent trade policy was incompatible with membership of a European customs union ndash something which Labour regards as essential.The EUrsquos chief negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that Brussels was ready to respond to any revision of Mrs Mayrsquos ldquored line demands, telling MPs in Portugal:ldquoIf they change, wersquoll change.Mr Barnier said that getting an agreement was ldquoin everybodyrsquos interest and that ldquosomething has to change to secure a orce deal.Shadow cabinet minister Barry Gardiner said Mrs May was clinging to her red lines because she knew that any compromise on them would ldquobreak the Conservative Party by pushing eurosceptic backbenchers in the European Research Groupto desert her.ldquoIf she wants to negotiate with all parties in Parliament, andshe wants to do that in good faith, she has to say lsquoOK, Irsquom not sticking to every single one of the red lines that Irsquove establishedrsquo, he told ITVrsquos Good Morning Britain.But Labourrsquos former prime minister Tony Blair said Mr Corbyn was wrong to snub the talks, telling BBC Radio rsquos Today:ldquoIf, in a moment of national crisis, the Prime Minister asks the Leader of the Opposition to come and talk, of course he should.And Conservative chairman Brandon Lewis accused Labour of ldquotrying to frustrate and avoid Brexit.Mrs May has said that ldquothe door remains open to Labour for talks ahead of the deadline for her to present her Plan B to MPs on Monday.Her motion is expected to be amended by MPs seeking parliamentary support for a range of options, from ruling out no-deal to extending the two-year Article  process or calling a second referendum.The Commons will vote on the proposals on January , in a full day of debate expected to shed light on what Brexit solutions may be able to command a majority in Parliament.Mr Corbyn confirmed that Labour will table an amendment setting out its favoured outcome of a customs union with a UK say over future trade deals, a close single market relationship and safeguards for rights.Another amendment from Tory backbencher Nick Boles will offer to put Parliament in control of the Brexit process and extend the negotiation process beyond the scheduled date of EU withdrawal on March .\"Chancellor Philip Hammond admitted in a phone call with business leaders that the Government was ldquonot in control of the process and suggested Mr Bolesrsquo amendment could lead to Article  being ldquorescinded, according to a transcript obtained by the Daily .Downing Street said meetings would be held with MPs representing the ldquowhole range of opinion across the House, including some backbench Labour MPs.Some MPs were meeting with the Prime Minister and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay while others were seeing Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Environment Secretary Michael Gove.The DUPrsquos Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds attended Brexit talks in Downing Street Among those arriving for talks were a group of eurosceptic Tories including former Brexit Secretary David Davis and ERG vice-chairman Steve Baker, as well as Green MP Caroline Lucas, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price and the DUPrsquos Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster.Emerging from her meeting, Mrs Foster saidthe issue of the Irish backstop needed to be dealt with ldquoin a very clear wayBrexit negotiations are to make progress.Ms Lucas said the PM wasrefusing to take the possibility of ldquono deal off the table and was reluctant to extend Article .ldquoIrsquom not convinced shersquos willing to loosen any of the red lines shersquos set herself, said the Green MP.ldquoShe still thinks itrsquos going to be possible to tweak this deal sufficiently to get the MPs that voted against it

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ob_1.jpg","title":"leaders in business owen brennan","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Owen Brennan, Devenish Nutrition In , Devenish Nutrition was an agri-feed business, established in Fermanagh, with around two dozen staff.In the  years since its takeover, Owen Brennan, executive chairman with the now global company – which has its headquarters in Belfast – has grown the business from a firm with annual revenues of £m, to an international business now doing that in a week.“By the time we got there it was well-established for over  years. The shareholders were looking for somebody to take the business to the next stage.“While the company was smaller at the time, they were really keen to see it grow from the Northern Ireland base.“The business has grown substantially. At that time, the Northern Ireland revenues were over % of the entire sales. Today they are less than %.”However, Northern Ireland revenues are around five times larger than when Owen took over the business.Devenish has round  staff – across  nationalities, which is roughly the size of the entire workforce  years ago. But it counts Northern Ireland as its main base, and remains a key element of the business. The company sells into more than  countries.“The most important metric is that we spend around £m a year on innovation projects,” he said.“The big focus in  was seeing a niche opportunity for a specialised, innovative nutrition product, full-service business.”It deals in animal feed supplements – specialised high-value nutrients in a small pack. It also makes diets for small animals at the early stage of their lives, along with specialised nutritional products.And Owen says while the public hears about the negative impact of livestock, the positive impact isn’t heard.In his time at Devenish, Owen has been handed several accolades, including winning the BelfastCup  at the Ulster Farmers’ Union annual dinner.  “I’ve always taken those awards very seriously, and it’s the reflection of the work of a lot of people. I might happen to be the person that ends up being the recipient, but that’s only possible because of the success of the overall business.”He says, while sounding like a cliche it’s “genuinely a team effort”. “Part of my interestis that I see the parallels between sport and business.“Who is the most important person on the rugby field … actually, it’s everybody. If you have one weakness in that  or match-day .“If you take that analogy into the business area. I was once asked by a mentor, who did I think were the most important people in the business at that time. I said I didn’t know.“But he said ‘the telephone receptionist and the lorry driver’. He said those two people, between them, have by far and away the most customer contact in our business. I’ve never forgotten that. And  years later, I find that to be true.”On Brexit, Owen says the position among businesses has remained consistent, with a majority opposed to the UK leaving the EU.“The three things which have emerged to date include the diminution in the value of sterling – that has been a very bad thing for business, generally.“… the second effect has been uncertainty… le is uncertain, as is business. But anything that adds a large uncertainty in a business environment is not good.“The third is maybe a little harder to define. I think the debate around this leaves a lot to be desired. “People have said to me that the focus on immigration has made a lot of people, that would be described in those debates as immigrants, feeling very uncomfortable.“We are an international business, and had got to used to thinking of that international dimension as a good and wholly positive thing, so to hear a debate with that emphasis, with that sort of connotation for people of an international background.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gibsn_1.jpg","title":"outlook  the year ahead has forecasting ever been harder","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Professor Neil Gibson, chief economist at EY Ireland says in two decades in the field, predicting the future has never been harder Forecasting is always a challenge but, in  years as a professional economist, I have never had less confidence in predicting the year ahead than I do now.  At the time of writing, the nature of the UK’s departure from the EU remains unclear. Estimates of the economic impact of ious exit scenarios ranged from -% in a catastrophic exit .Notably, all of the iants suggested a loss of GDP in the UK, though it also worth noting that GDP means virtually nothing to most of the voting public.  The prediction of % loss in house prices in the disorderly scenario is much more likely to focus minds. Moreover, Brexit is far from the only uncertainty ahead.  Trade wars are continuing, oil prices are slumping and stock markets are incredibly volatile. Many of the global warning lights have flicked from green to amber and it is entirely possible that  will be a very challenging year indeed. Despite the gloomy introduction, the base case forecasts continue to suggest a year of modest growth ahead. EY predicts a small contraction in the local labour market but most other forecasters disagree. This base case projection assumes a transition period is in place and that a global slow-down does not materialise:  two rather large assumptions to make. The optimism is partly borne out of what has been a remarkable period of job growth in Northern Ireland. The workforce jobs measure reports , net additional jobs have been created in the year to Q . This continues a trend that started in  and has seen the overall employment level rise by , since Q . This is despite very modest levels of recorded GDP growth and, finally, it has taken the region back above the total employment levels reached in . This performance is a credit to businesses throughout the region as, remarkably, all council areas have enjoyed job growth and all sectors outside of public administration have increased their headcounts since Q . The consumer is, perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the economy heading into . Inflation is running very close to UK average salary increases, which means that, on average, people are not getting richer. However, overall consumer spending has been rising – partly because there are more people in work and partly because people have been willing to run down savings or take on debt.The data shows NI to be particularly vulnerable in this regard, with higher proportions of people without savings . The fragile state of the economy means,  probably, that interest rate increases are unlikely, especially with falling oil prices easing inflation, but the impact of a change in consumer sentiment and spending behaviour would trigger a marked slow-down. Consumer confidence measures are inherently volatile but there are reasons to be concerned. Confidence surveys have been edging downwards – the UK credit conditions surveys suggest a tightening amongst lenders in  and savings ratiosare at historic lows. Consumer trends should be watched closely in early  as they will prove critical to overall economic performance. TRENDS TO WATCH IN There are a number of economic trends I would expect to see in :Continued retail transformation: it has been a dficult time on the high street as consumers move increasingly to on-line shopping. A number of high profile closures have taken a toll and we expect this pattern to continue.  This will, as all periods of change do, create winners and losers and will  place pressure further on an outdated rates system that relies heavily on retailing. Embracing digital: the potential that new forms of technology presents has been clear for some time. Articial intelligence, blockchain, software as a service , data analyticshave long been touted as potential game changers. There has been a marked pick-up over the last  months in firms making investments in these areas. Maturing of the technologies and a tighter labour market are factors in these trends and we expect that to continue in . Pockets of growth: regardless of the wider economic conditions, there will continue to be pockets of very fast growth throughout Northern Ireland. The pipeline of professional services inward investment remains strong, in particular with US firms seeking talent a noticeable trend. Media and film continues to boom and, even on the high street, there is no sign of a slowdown in the proleration of coffee shops, personal wellbeing businesses and take away outlets. Volatility: share prices and exchange rates are likely to be incredibly ‘spikey’ given the turbulence in the world economy. Summary – beating the forecasters The Northern Ireland economy’s labour market has surprised me over the past  months. I hope that it continues to outperform expectations in .  Hopefully, there will be a transition period in place with a clear roadmap to a future free trade agreement between the EU and UK which may prevent the scale of slow-down I worry may be coming. While on the subject of wish-casting, let us hope that the Executive is back and operating too in . If all these pieces fall into place then next year’s outlook for  will be much easier to write.

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
