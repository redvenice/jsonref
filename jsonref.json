The ready meals are pictured above ready to be shipped to various places across the country          Ready set fire! Sophie said she rarely pulls the trigger herself and described herself as an \u0027awful shot\u0027The meals are perfect for people looking for more local and sustainable food sources - and to cut the air miles out of their eating.\u0027I\u0027m very much a country girl, born and bred, and have always been frustrated at the bad press pheasant gets,\u0027 Sophie said.\u0027Everyone\u0027s default is chicken, but pheasant is much better for you. It\u0027s had a better life, it\u0027s free range and sustainable.\u0027It\u0027s definitely far better than a chicken which has been cooped up in a cage all its life.\u0027Quintessentially British, pheasants have been shot across the nation for several centuries, but in recent years have rarely been eaten outside countryside communities.              Preparing the bird: Sophie is pictured left cutting the bird and right plucking the feathers to prepare it         Proud as punch. Sophie said she sometimes serves friends and family pheasant and they have no ideaThe rich, gamey flavour sometimes puts off diners, but Sophie is a passionate advocate for the taste and health benefits of the birds.She has overcome this by adding the meat to family favourites and allowing customers to get used to the flavoursome game.Sophie came up with the idea for ready meals in January 2018, when playing a trick on her husband Matthew.He had always insisted he didn\u0027t like pheasant, much to his wife\u0027s frustration.              Out in the wild! Sophie is pictured above carrying her birds through the fields after a shoot          Country girl at heart! Sophie said her upbringing in the Highlands had helped her with her new business Sophie had grown up in the glens of Scotland, where pheasant and other game were regular dinner-time meals.\u0027We used to have a freezer full of pheasants all throughout the year, which had been shot by my father and grandfather,\u0027 she said.\u0027It was one of the most common meats we ate growing up, there was always a plentiful supply through the season.\u0027But despite her hunting heritage, she could not persuade her husband to try it.\u0027I thought if he doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s pheasant, what he doesn\u0027t know won\u0027t hurt him,\u0027 Sophie explained, laughing.\u0027I made him a pheasant lasagne, and he said that\u0027s the best lasagne we\u0027ve had for ages.\u0027         Up close and personal. Sophie said you can trick people into eating pheasant by disguising it as something they recognise And Matthew, also 43, actually refused to believe that Sophie had used game in the Italian dish.She eventually had to fish the pheasant feathers and carcass out of the bin to prove it.\u0027I\u0027ve come across a huge number of friends who have been the same, and refused to eat pheasant if I\u0027ve cooked it for a dinner party,\u0027 Sophie said.\u0027So I\u0027ve been experimenting on them and not telling them.\u0027Half the time, if you turn it into something that people recognise then you can almost trick them into believing it\u0027s what they think it is.\u0027They are not expecting these meals to contain anything other than beef, lamb or pork.\u0027And the results were great, diners loved Sophie\u0027s secret pheasant dishes.She explained: \u0027My husband, and a couple of friends said, you might be on to something here.\u0027While several butchers were doing game pasties, no one was creating healthy ready meals from the birds.But she thought wrapping up the meat in pastry, or deep frying it, lost the health benefits.         Time to tuck in! Sophie is pictured above with what looks to be a Italian style dish which she has cooked up Sophie continued: \u0027Pheasant is readily available, relatively inexpensive, and no one wants to do the gory bit - the plucking and everything else.\u0027So I thought present it as something people recognise, and they\u0027ll be more likely to give it a go.\u0027Sophie set up her business and began approaching shoots.It was an environment she was very comfortable in due to her Highland upbringing.Her father still shoots regularly, and her grandfather shot as well.She quickly agreed a deal with two local shoots - one near Ripon and the other at Easingwold, both North Yorks.The day after the hunt, Sophie drives down in her old Range Rover and fills up the boot with the birds.Sometimes she will pick up just a dozen and other times almost 200 pheasants.The number depends on the skill of shooters and also the weather.\u0027They are not too pongy, as all the birds have been in chillers,\u0027 Sophie explained.She lugs them back to the beautiful, detached cottage she and Matthew share with their two cocker iels near Boroughbridge, North Yorks.Sophie then begins the arduous task of plucking and gutting them in the garage.This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 10 hours depending on the number of birds.But Sophie keeps herself entertained.\u0027The wonders of technology mean I can rig the iPad up in the garage, and watch TV while I\u0027m doing it,\u0027 she said.Unsurprisingly, she watches cooking shows to while away the hours spent plucking.The first dish Sophie came up with was the lasagne she used to trick Matthew.She also makes bolognese, cottage pie and chilli con pheasant.Particularly popular are the Black Sheep ale and pheasant casserole, and also coq au vin with local wine.She batch cooks all of the dishes in her Aga, before packaging them up ready for the microwave.Over the hunting season - from October to February - Sophie says she makes hundreds of ready meals.\u0027I think it can work in anything, it\u0027s so versatile,\u0027 she said.\u0027Back in the day, people would hang the birds for a couple of weeks and it would have a much stronger gamier flavour.\u0027The majority of people\u0027s palettes these days aren\u0027t particularly up for that.\u0027The boozy ones in particular do very well.\u0027Sophie has lots of tasters at the Yorkshire markets she sells the ready meals at.She cooks a pheasant version of crispy duck, which is especially popular.\u0027When people do stop and try it, they tend to buy it,\u0027 she revealed happily.In the age of heavy industrialised meat production, Sophie\u0027s method harks back to simpler times when Brits ate what they hunted from the land.The meals are also far more sustainable than domestically farmed chicken, being sourced from the Yorkshire dales just half an hour from her front door.Many chefs across the UK are now looking to reconnect with the British countryside by using more game in their dishes.British Game Alliance founder Tom Adams said the birds were a good option for those wishing to lower their carbon footprint.\u0027As well as enjoying a longer, better quality of life, wild game also has a lower carbon footprint than most mass-produced meats,\u0027 he said.\u0027The industry is essential to the management and maintenance of countryside environments.\u0027The UK\u0027s largest shooting organisation, the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, explained the sport is worth £2 billion each year to the UK economy, and supports 74,000 full-time jobs.Spokeswoman Debbie Collins said: \u0027Game meat is great - pheasant not only tastes delicious but is also healthy and sustainable.\u0027It is low in fat and loaded with protein and vitamins.\u0027It is a seasonal, local, versatile and nutritious food source.\u0027Initiatives to open up the market and encourage more people to try it for themselves are welcomed.\u0027Sophie\u0027s recipes sound delicious. Good luck to her.\u0027And growing up in the glens of Scotland, from a family of shooters, the industry is close to Sophie\u0027s heart.She added: \u0027There\u0027s often this perception that shooting is just for toffs, but the money it ploughs into the economy is staggering.\u0027It really is a way of life for a lot of people in the countryside.\u0027At the moment Sophie\u0027s tasty game ready meals are only available at markets across Yorkshire.But after this season ends, she will begin working on a website to deliver them across the country.Eventually she hopes to stock her ready meals in supermarkets and reach a wider audience of the wonders of wild game.And if she can convince her husband to eat pheasant regularly, then many more diners are likely to enjoy these unique ready meals. "},{"url":null,"title":"Is worlds grumpiest dog Meet Chico pint sized pooch permanent scowl","story":"Share this article \u0027I wasn\u0027t sure if that was something that would change when his puppy teeth fell out but I hoped it would not.

There’s plenty of photographs of me dressed in that sort of kit but not there.\u0027                 In a November TV interview, Andrew maintained that he does not recall meeting Giuffre US Attorney General William Barr has vowed to aggressively investigate and bring charges against anyone who may have helped Epstein, who killed himself in his jail cell last summer while he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.The case brought renewed scrutiny to Epstein\u0027s many high-profile associates, including Andrew, who says he met the financier in 1999. The pair maintained their friendship even after Epstein served 13 months in a Florida county jail after pleading guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution in 2008. Andrew came under fire in 2010 after it was revealed that he stayed at Epstein\u0027s Manhattan home following his release from jail.     Asked during the November interview whether he regretted continuing his friendship with Epstein, Andrew said: \u0027Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes.\u0027 The BBC interviewer replied: \u0027Unbecoming? He was a sex offender.\u0027Andrew then apologized, saying: \u0027I\u0027m being polite, I mean in the sense that he was a sex offender. \u0027But no, was I right in having him as a friend? At the time, bearing in mind this was some years before he was accused of being a sex offender. \u0027I don\u0027t there was anything wrong then, the problem was the fact that once he had been convicted I stayed with him and that’s the bit that, as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that.\u0027 Andrew was also friends with Maxwell, the British socialite accused in several civil lawsuits of recruiting girls and young women for Epstein to sexually abuse.Last week, a former police protection officer for Andrew came forward to claim that Maxwell would visit the prince at Buckingham Palace up to four times a day and that the pair would enjoy picnics together on the grounds of the estate in London. Met Police officer Paul Page, who worked for the Royals from 1998 to 2004, told The Mirror he first became aware of who Maxwell was in 2001 when the privy purse - the office that handles the Queen\u0027s private income - called to inform him that a guest was coming to see Andrew but that the name was not to be entered into the book. \u0027She turned up in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover and we let her in. Half an hour after that me and my colleague walked through the garden to go back to the police lodge and he was having a picnic with her by the summer house, opposite the Queen\u0027s ­bedroom window,\u0027 Page said.\u0027One of my colleagues saw her come in and out the Palace four times in one day.\u0027 Andrew claimed in the BBC interview that he last saw Maxwell in the early spring of last year, months before he was arrested on sex trafficking charges.  Maxwell has denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein but is believed to be one of the key figures in the US government\u0027s probe. Two guards who were supposed to be monitoring Epstein the night he was found dead have already been charged with falsifying the jail\u0027s log books to indicate they were performing checks on prisoners, when they were actually sleeping or browsing the internet.  Prince Andrew \u0027had visits from Ghislaine Maxwell 4 times a day\u0027 says ex-protection officer - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Just horsing Adorable moment miniature horse plays leaf blower","story":"Share this article Owner Michael Puryear said: \u0027He will play with the blower as long I have it out. \u0027Sometimes, it’s hard to get work done as he always wants to play, but I love it.\u0027At the end of the video, you will see when I sit the blower down, he comes over and paws at it for me to put it in his face.\u0027              The miniature horse has a small size as it suffers from a form of horse dwarfism.

As a result, he was hired by Tina Brown as Tatler’s society photographer, with an insider’s eye for the edge between observation and satire. When Brown moved to New York in 1984 to edit Vanity Fair, Jones moved too, in 1988.Nearly a decade later, in 1997, he was sent to photograph Vanity Fair’s annual Oscars bash by Brown’s successor as editor, Graydon Carter. He was struggling to find a good image until he noticed Mick Jagger sitting by himself looking bored, the world’s least likely wallflower. “Madonna crossed the room and sat down next to him,” Jones recalls. “She started talking and he became quite animated. Then Tony Curtis came along and sat down at the same table on the other side and started monopolising Madonna.

Should the Royal Mint have used an Oxford comma on its Brexit 50p piece?Three million coins bearing the slogan “Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations” are due to enter circulation from 31 January, with Sajid Javid, chancellor of the exchequer, expressing his hope that the commemorative coin will mark “the beginning of this new chapter” as the UK leaves the European Union.However, early responses include His Dark Materials novelist Philip Pullman’s criticism of its punctuation.“The ‘Brexit’ 50p coin is missing an Oxford comma, and should be boycotted by all literate people,” wrote the novelist on Twitter, while Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell wrote that, while it was “not perhaps the only objection” to the Brexit-celebrating coin, “the lack of a comma after ‘prosperity’ is killing me”.The quote echoes Thomas Jefferson’s first inaugural address as US president in 1801, when he laid out the “essential principles” of his government – including (and note the comma usage) “peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none”. A plan to produce a commemorative Brexit coin last year had to be abandoned because it was marked with the original departure date of 31 October.The criticism of the new coins follows the Bank of England’s decision to use a quote on its Jane Austen bank note about the joys of reading – apparently unaware that the character who utters the words has no interest in reading. Ireland’s Central Bank, meanwhile, misquoted Ulysses on a commemorative coin intended to honour James Joyce.The Oxford, or serial, comma is included before the final “and” in lists. It has fierce defenders and equally fierce detractors – in 2011, when it was erroneously reported that the Oxford comma was being dropped by the University of Oxford style guide, one punctuation lover asked: “Are you people insane? The Oxford comma is what separates us from the animals.”According to the  style guide, straightforward lists do not need an Oxford comma, but it can sometimes help the reader – and it is sometimes essential. “Compare: ‘I dedicate this book to my parents, Martin Amis, and JK Rowling’ with ‘I dedicate this book to my parents, Martin Amis and JK Rowling’.”The Associated Press is similarly cautious about coming down on one side of the debate. “We say: If omitting a comma could lead to confusion or misinterpretation, then use the comma. But: If a comma doesn’t help make clear what is being said, don’t use it. ‘The flag is red, white and blue’ is clear. Put a comma before the concluding conjunction in a series if an integral element of the series requires a conjunction. For example: I had orange juice, toast, and ham and eggs for breakfast.”In 2017, however, the lack of an Oxford comma helped a group of Maine dairy drivers in a dispute about overtime pay. The state’s law had said that the following activities did not count for overtime pay: “The canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of: (1) Agricultural produce (2) Meat and fish products and (3) Perishable foods.” The drivers had said that because there was no comma between “packing for shipment” and “or distribution”, the law was referring to the single activity of “packing”, not to “packing” and “distribution” as two separate activities. And as the drivers distributed, but did not pack, the goods, this would make them eligible for overtime pay. The judge sided with the drivers.“For want of a comma, we have this case,” he wrote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6a1a9d69a4794c06c684390a08ff8bee3df7f71/0_119_3175_1905/master/3175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6414b7b18f7ba7975a7671b204cc34b5","title":"margaret atwood to publish first collection of poetry in over a decade","story":"Dearly, out in November, will be the Canadian author’s first book since The TestamentsMargaret Atwood is set to publish her first collection of poetry in over a decade, an exploration of “absences and endings, ageing and retrospection” that will also feature werewolves, aliens and sirens.After jointly winning the Booker prize with Bernardine Evaristo last year for her bestselling sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale, The Testaments, Atwood’s publisher said today that the 80-year-old Canadian author’s next book would be Dearly.

As with HS2, Boris Johnson is guaranteed to end up infuriating one side of the argument. The stakes, though, are substantially higher here, whatever the prime minister says about his hopes for compromise. One route could lead to trade conflict with the US. The other could pile costs on to the UK’s 5G network, with a knock-on impact on UK competitiveness.Those extra technology costs are almost the only element in this quarrel that is not disputed. Even non-techie outsiders can understand how the expense would arise. The 5G technology is intended to build on the existing 4G infrastructure, where Huawei’s gadgetry is used in UK masts and antennas. An outright ban would amount to a time-consuming “rip and repair” job, say the companies. One way or another, consumers and businesses would pay the bill.The same issue does not arise in the US because its networks are largely built with equipment from the only other big firms left in the market – Nokia and Ericsson. Blocking Huawei would narrow choice further, at least until Samsung or somebody else fills the gap in the market.None of the other factors is straightforward. Huawei swears it is not an arm of the Chinese state, but few believe it would refuse instructions from Beijing to spy. The US says the cybersecurity risks are severe, but the UK’s security services say they can be managed if Huawei’s kit is kept to the periphery. Australia has opted for an outright ban, but some argue the UK’s network is safer by design.In normal circumstances, you would bet on Johnson to take the easy option but it’s hard to say which that is here. In the end, though, the key consideration should be this: this is a security issue and a UK prime minister should back his security advisers.James Benamor, the founder of Amigo Holdings, wants to find a friend. Specifically, he’d like someone to buy his unlovely company, which makes its money by lending to sub-prime borrowers, as the euphemism has it, provided they can find a friend or relation to guarantee both interest and principal.As you would also expect, regulators have taken a sceptical look at this business model. Officials are not specifically interested in Amigo’s potential to wreck friendships and ruin family relationships, but the point is related. Do guarantors truly understand they could be on the hook? Do all parties understand the risks properly? Why are there so many complaints?Outside shareholders know that already. Amigo somehow got itself floated at a £1.3bn valuation in 2018, but it has been downhill since. The shares were listed at 275p, which enabled Benamor’s Richmond Group to bank the thick end of £300m from selling a minority stake, but they stand now at 48.6p. The flotation has been disastrous.Those non-Benamor shareholders should have known better, of course. Being a minority investor can be uncomfortable even in good times. Now outsiders are exposed to the risk that Benamor could add insult to their financial injury by trying to take Amigo private again with his float proceeds.The other people who should have steered a wide course are the advisers. Alongside RBC Capital Markets and Macquarie Capital, you will find the grand blue-chip name of JP Morgan Cazenove on the float documents. That’s the same JP Morgan where boss Jamie Dimon preaches a gospel of social responsibility these days.

The first big decision we now face is to choose who is best placed to take the fight to the Tories.But the deputy leadership election will also have a big impact on whether we win next time. Over the coming years, the deputy leader will be responsible for much of the heavy lifting needed to reconnect with the communities we’ve lost.It’s an important role and shouldn’t be seen as a leader in waiting, or about building an alternative power base, or being a mischief maker. If elected I want to define the role more clearly than it has been in recent years. I’ll be the campaigner in chief and organiser in chief as we get the party ready to win the next election.After such a huge loss we have many lessons to learn – and we must learn them for the good of the communities we represent.But I don’t think our policies were to blame. We didn’t lose because we backed a living wage of £10 an hour, pledged to return rail and mail to the public sector, or proposed an active green industrial strategy to reverse the years of economic decline and deindustrialisation that still blights too much of our country.While Jeremy Corbyn failed to win a general election, he decisively shifted Labour from lukewarm opposition to cuts and close association with illegal wars to offering a real alternative. I am the only deputy leadership candidate to have supported Jeremy Corbyn in both leadership elections. Some will support me because of that, others won’t. But I don’t regret that decision for a second. It was necessary to change the policy direction of the party in 2015.Having great policies is nowhere near enough, however. They have to be trusted by the public and, to win a hearing, they have to be organised around. So my priority as deputy leader will be to overhaul Labour’s organisation, campaigning and messaging.I have campaigned under four different Labour leaders and three deputies. But the image that always sticks in my mind is John Prescott touring the country in 1997 with his famous pledge card. In many ways that sums up what I’ll do as deputy leader. I want us to focus on 10 key policies that are easily understandable on the doorstep and that can be an organising focus for our huge membership.Every news bulletin we get on, every opposition debate we organise, and every public rally we hold should focus on lodging this alternative in the public’s mind.That clarity will be needed as we fight for every vote. Whole swaths of the north and Midlands voted Conservative for the first time. There has been much talk of people “lending” their vote to Boris Johnson. But we should not be so complacent as to think those votes will automatically come back. Scotland is a stark reminder that once seats are lost, they can stay lost.That’s why I want to be a campaigning deputy leader building a party rooted in every community.Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid is based on mobilising thousands of local volunteers with deep connections to their communities. That’s what I want for our party. It’s how we win back all our former heartlands and build a party that reflects the full ersity of the working class in 21st-century multicultural Britain.And just as John Prescott seemed to be permanently on his battle bus, I want to be out across the country, not just stuck in Westminster. So, I make this pledge: within the first month of being deputy leader I will visit every single seat we lost. Within the first three months, I’ll visit every seat we need to win next time. And by halfway through this parliament I will have visited every single seat in the country.But which policies will we focus on to reconnect? I don’t think that’s for me to decide, nor is it for the new leader. As deputy leader I want to devolve power back to Labour’s members and trade unions. Our grassroots must be treated as more than unpaid postal workers delivering leaflets in all weathers.That’s why at last week’s hustings I was the first candidate to speak out for open selection. Some have dismissed this as an irrelevance. But if it is not the members and trade unions deciding the policies and the candidates, who does? If we are to reconnect with lost communities, don’t we need Labour members from those areas informing everything we do? From the outset I made it clear that I am backing Rebecca Long-Bailey to be Labour’s next leader and the party’s first female leader. But whoever leads Labour, I look forward to working with them.

On Monday the inquiry’s second phase opened with the revelation that Arconic, the cladding system’s manufacturer, knew five years before Grenfell’s refurbishment that its panels were “not suitable for use on building facades” in Europe because they did not meet safety standards.When much of the argument about the disaster’s causes is unavoidably technical, involving as it does details of construction contracts and building regulation, such straightforward language has an immediate impact. A series of emails from an Arconic official, cited in a statement from the main building contractor, Rydon, referred to the “bad behaviour” of the Reynobond PE 55 panels when fitted in cassette form – as they were at Grenfell – and added that it expected them to be put “out of market”. The inquiry also heard that Celotex, the company which made the insulation used on Grenfell, was concerned in 2013 about how the material would behave in a fire when used behind cladding.Arconic gives its opening statement on Tuesday. Richard Millett QC, counsel to the inquiry, has spoken of “a merry-go-round of buck-passing”. So far, he said, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and Celotex were the only core participants to have accepted any responsibility for the disastrous events of 14 June 2017, with the council admitting that it failed in its duty as a building regulator.Navigating between rival versions of events, and making recommendations to government, is the challenge now facing the inquiry. It was never likely that the participants were going to make this task any easier unless they were forced to. Arconic and Celotex are subject to civil court proceedings brought by bereaved relatives in the US, which could lead to huge payouts. In the UK, the politan police are waiting for the inquiry’s conclusions before deciding whether to pursue manslaughter and corporate manslaughter charges, and civil litigation is possible.But the strength of the evidence presented on day one of the inquiry’s second phase may have the effect of focusing minds. Confidence among victims’ groups has taken a battering in recent weeks, after they discovered what they believed to be a conflict of interest. Benita Mehra, an engineer appointed to the panel created to advise the inquiry’s chair, Sir Martin Moore-Bick – a panel that victims fought for – stepped down at the weekend, 10 days after it was revealed that an organisation she led received a £71,000 grant from Arconic’s philanthropic foundation.Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle died at Grenfell, said relations between the inquiry and the bereaved have moved “10 steps backwards” as a result, and ministers should apologise for a crass oversight as well as find a replacement in short order. Victims are entitled to be furious. But the reality is that, right now, the inquiry is their best chance of getting at the truth about what happened, ensuring that nothing similar happens again, and providing the police with evidence for any prosecutions. Sir Martin’s criticism of the London fire brigade commissioner, Dany Cotton, was rightly followed by her resignation. It is too soon to say what phase two will lead to but, especially in these fraught first days, the inquiry should do all it can to rebuild trust in a necessary process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0f51724ed71c83c33a2f72e2e4d06ca47ab2a11/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b22049f37b05ae3d39c5e2f19ddb7f09","title":"we should thank fergal keane for bearing witness to unbearable horrors","story":"The BBC reporter has revealed that his work has left him with PTSD. On Holocaust Memorial Day, we should remember the debt we owe to those who have experienced dreadful things on our behalfTrauma, like its sibling stress, is a much-overused word these days. People are “stressed” by a full inbox or “traumatised” because they left their phone in an Uber. Maybe we underplay the reality of trauma because we cannot look it in the face. Our streets are full of bundles of rags in sleeping bags, with people inside. We could ask them about the trauma of abuse or addiction, but we scuttle past. This is not a blame game – we all cope by shutting down.But what if you can’t shut down? What if you can’t forget? What if the horrors you have seen can’t be put in a box marked “the past”, but are ever-present? Then you are in trouble. It was tremendously brave, even for a brave man such as the BBC reporter Fergal Keane, to talk about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Keane had been dealing with this after decades of reporting from conflict zones all over the world. His colleague Jeremy Bowen has spoken of long period of depression and PTSD after his many years in the Middle East.I have worked with reporters who could never manage a normal life and were always itching to get back to what most of us would call hell. War zones felt alive family routine felt dead.The first step in treating trauma is recognising it. I have met therapists brought in to do bereavement counselling for Grenfell survivors who said they couldn’t begin that work because these people were still in trauma. They could smell the smoke and see the flames. I once spoke to soldiers with the charity Combat Stress, and their agitation was so visible it was alarming. One man told me that, just behind me, he could see his friend on fire. Another would be having tea in a cafe with his family, a curtain would flicker and he would e under the table. These men had served in the Falklands, Ireland and Iraq. What we once called shellshock we now see as PTSD.There is minimal help for these people.There is medication and there are various types of therapy, from cognitive processing (where you may begin to understand that what has happened is not your fault) to a kind of exposure treatment (which means learning not to avoid what triggers memories) to eye-movement desensitisation, which appears to be getting results, although no one knows why.What all these treatments (except drugs) have in common is that patients need the presence of another person, to remember in a place of safety. This is as true for survivors of sexual abuse as it is for young lads returning from Afghanistan.We need witnesses. As the great Judith Herman wrote: “The conflict between the will to deny horrible events and the will to proclaim them aloud is the central dialectic of psychological trauma.” No wonder, then, that journalists may suffer – they see suffering most of us never want to see.Writing this on Holocaust Memorial Day, I am minded to think of what happens when there are no more witnesses. There are so few Holocaust survivors left that it’s the job of the rest of us now. “Job” is the wrong word – it is our moral imperative.We are beginning to understand how trauma crosses generations. Some find epigenetic reasons others suggest that the children of survivors may have been asked to hold information that is too much to take on. Recovery from trauma requires a feeling of security, mourning and a connection back to normal life. The horrifying rise of antisemitism should make everyone think about why Jewish people may again feel afraid.Everywhere now I see a belittling of therapy (a self-indulgent chat about feelings) and journalism (fake news), and I connect these two things. Why? Because the best people of these professions – and Keane is definitely one – are witnesses. Herman talks of the “potential power of any relationship of witnessing”. This is both the hardest and the most powerful thing we can do. But it is more necessary now than ever. We bear witness. We remember, we mourn, we reconnect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0597b9d6a97e9c8fcd5faf1bf53edfe89dd6ec33/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa134753169f16091e22fdd70fd5b4e0","title":"kobe bryant dear basketball a love letter to a sport that is now a poignant epitaph","story":"The NBA star’s Oscar-winning short film, in which he mused on his post-basketball future, now has a new layer of sadness and ironyDear Basketball was always a bittersweet piece of work. This was the Oscar-winning short film from 2017 directed by the Disney animator Glen Keane, with stirring music by John Williams and written, produced and narrated by Kobe Bryant, on the occasion of his retirement from basketball.It is not merely a love letter to the sport that had given him so much, but a deeply sad farewell to it: almost an expression of grief, or therapy for grief. In the previous few years, he had been agonised by injuries that were making continued top-flight competition an impossibility the fragility of human bodies is always a particular agony for athletes of Bryant’s calibre. “I can’t love you obsessively for much longer,” Bryant says to basketball. “My body knows it’s time to say goodbye.” Now, of course, these thoughts have a new layer of sadness, as well as a jarring irony. The goodbye that Bryant envisaged in Dear Basketball was a natural progression to other things, and he mused on what his post-basketball career was going to bring him. Clearly, some work in movies was a very real possibility. But it was not to be.Dear Basketball is also a tender meditation on Bryant’s own boyhood: the fluid pencil-stroke-style animation morphs the adult Bryant back and forth between a stylised representation of his magnificent triumphs on the court with Bryant as the little kid in his bedroom dreaming of glory. He was the basketball-obsessed kid who took his dad’s tube socks, rolled them up into a ball and kept shooting it into a little hoop on the other side of the room. The dad in question is the former professional player and coach Joe Bryant, who survives his son at the age of 65.Dear Basketball starts with the ecstatic moment of scoring, the transcendental moment of pure success as the ball dunks down into the hoop with such conviction and force that the netting floats up it’s a thrill that never gets old. Yet the emphatic beats of a sporting narrative are blurred and softened by the visual style. The animation itself is something that confers a kind of nostalgia on both Bryant’s older and younger self. It’s very different from watching basketball live or on TV, and maybe the film sentimentalises a sport that incorporates such blaringly commercial ingredients – but it is allowable, for a film that is explicitly about Bryant saying goodbye, and heading off into a different future that he admits he still cannot quite envisage.There is something arguably childlike about someone expressing pure, passionate love not for people, but for a sport, incarnated in the ball itself. But there is a heart-wrenching honesty in it as well. Dear Basketball is a melancholy, thoughtful film. Now as his epitaph, it is desperately poignant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac6f454d19c910b402d48ac88de4a7637a7cb0e9/68_0_1032_619/master/1032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e26ac0577c2f7aeaa1d906c3c747da4","title":"the nest review jude law carrie coon","story":"The director of Martha Marcy May Marlene has delivered an accomplished follow-up focused on a family imploding in a gloomy house in SurreyThere’s always a warm homecoming at festivals for directors who return after breaking out there years prior, as well as an unspoken fear that their follow-up might not have quite the same impact. In 2011, Sean Durkin premiered his first feature, the chilly psychodrama Martha Marcy May Marlene, at Sundance and won a directing award as well as a flurry of excitable reviews, planting his name, as well as star Elizabeth Olsen’s, on the map. It was the kind of jolting debut that made anyone who watched it curious to know what he would do next. In the nine years since, he directed the disturbing British miniseries Southcliffe, but has been notably absent from the big screen. He returns to the fold this year with the accomplished and uneasy family drama The Nest, a film with a delicate slow build that feels fitting for a director who’s also taken his time to make it.Durkin, who was born in Canada before moving to Britain and then New York, has taken elements from his continent-hopping youth for the plot of his latest, the story of a family making the big move and the emotional rot that sets in. It’s the 1980s, and the O’Haras are leaving their suburban American setting to live in the UK, where father Rory (Jude Law) was born. His American wife Alison (Carrie Coon) is unsure, having moved four times in the past 10 years, but he’s convinced there are financial opportunities they simply can’t afford to turn down. He works as a commodities broker but is driven by an ambition to do and make more, and as they settle into their new lives at a grandiose country mansion in Surrey, his excitement for what lies ahead starts to unravel.Rory is a convincingly cocksure smooth-talker whose embrace of the American dream has returned him to England with a different, more daring worldview. He’s hungry and wants to give his family more, even if they might already have enough. His background was one of limited means and so his idea of happiness is somewhat skewed, forever trying to play the part of a man he never thought he could become, tirelessly constructing an extravagant self-image to mask his working-class origins. But it means he’s often blinded to what his family really needs, and so as he pushes them further and further into a financial bracket they cannot easily sustain, cracks start to appear.There’s a deftly controlled interplay between a man who wants to be in control in a traditional sense and a quietly strong-willed wife who wants to allow him this but fears for the price his reckless decision-making might have on their family. Alison is constantly told she doesn’t need to concern herself with the bigger picture (“It’s not your job to worry,” Rory tells her at one point) but she’s smart enough to know something is awry. The ridiculously ostentatious house they live in, the hunt for a Mayfair apartment, talk of a condo in the Algarve – it’s all, embarrassingly, obviously too much. Watching Alison gain the strength to challenge Rory, sometimes in darkly amusing ways, gives the film some of its most dramatically juicy moments but the film avoids feeding us the more predictably telegraphed conflict we might expect from the set-up.Because The Nest is a slow burn, requiring extreme, dedicated patience even from those familiar with Durkin’s last film. He gently plays with genre tropes, briefly fooling us into thinking that maybe we’re watching a horror film set in a dark, decaying old house, but the horror is of a more human kind as the decay starts to infect the family dynamic, slowly but surely taking them to a place that might not allow for a return. Law is an actor known for his magnetic charm, but it’s always more compelling to watch it backgrounded by a certain darkness, and this is him at his best, playing a man who starts to question the bullshit he’s lived by for so long. Coon, an actor who typically finds a way of stealing whatever film she’s in no matter how small the role, is also on top form, gently crumbling while also finding herself as a woman. The pair convince entirely as a married couple with a history, shown less to us through exposition and more through day-to-day behaviour.It’s elegantly constructed and precisely composed, with Durkin painstakingly recreating an era without falling into nostalgic overload. But it’s also a drama about a family that keeps us at a distance for the most part. It’s intriguing without always being involving and while the lethargic narrative might speed up in the final act, it’s only by a fraction and I wanted just a little bit more of something to grasp on to at the end, having spent so much time with characters I found so fascinating. I feel as though The Nest will haunt me though with its eerie portrait of a family falling apart without ever being sure if they can put themselves back together again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7e740fe339be5fa71c78f5e830ec38a1df54a55/0_130_5197_3119/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f272120c4bbcae6e7c54cb0b1fe3e5d5","title":"global heating may lead to wine shortage vineyard","story":"From wildfires to rising tides, the climate crisis is already bringing many threats. Now scientists say it may also bring a shortage of many popular wines.Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Morales-Castilla and colleagues report how they built a computer model that takes into account the timing of processes such as budding and fruit ripening for the 11 different varieties, as well as the climate in areas where these varieties are currently grown. From this, they identified areas within current wine-growing regions suitable for each of the 11 varieties.While Morales-Castilla said that was partly down to factors such as changes in rainfall, the main driver was heat. He noted this might damage plants, or speed up ripening and make the grapes too high in sugar.For example, many areas of wine land suitable for pinot noir, including in South Africa and Burgundy, will need to be switched to grapes such as syrah, monastrell and grenache, which produce fruit later in the year and are better able to tolerate a warmer climate.And there’s more: the team found that new areas around the world – including parts of the UK – would become suitable for wine grapes as the planet continues to heat, with early-ripening varieties such as pinot noir moving north.The study has limitations, including the fact that it only looks at a handful of the more than 1,100 varieties of wine grape. Morales-Castilla suggested other varieties might offer greater potential for adaptation as the climate continued to heat up.The team said mitigation efforts were not without their problems: replanting or regrafting vineyards is expensive. There are also complex rules about how wines are labelled: for example, the name “champagne” can legally be used only if the sparkling wine comes from the Champagne region of France.“The challenge for the industry will be that local varieties often add distinctive characters to wines, and there will be a reluctance to let go of traditional varieties, especially in areas with strong cultural heritage. Can you imagine a burgundy without a pinot noir grape, for instance?”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f68a4ded97dd8a3494ba8fe83ef40a9c5ef86965/0_63_3684_2211/master/3684.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9836f50cb651c9f18306a3f8c7d88ac1","title":"michelin launches 2020 guide controversy bocuse auberge du pont de collonges third star","story":"Head of guide defends stripping late chef’s Auberge du Pont de Collonges of coveted third starThe 2020 edition of the Michelin guide, the “gastronomy bible” that can make or break restaurant reputations, has been launched amid fresh controversy over a leak that revealed it had downgraded the oldest three-star restaurant in the world.After a year in which the little red book’s ratings have been challenged in court, the loss of a coveted third star for the late chef Paul Bocuse’s Auberge du Pont de Collonges near Lyon sparked anger in the restaurant world.Gwendal Poullennec, the head of the Michelin guide, defended the move by insisting stars were not “inherited” and “must be earned every year”.“We obviously understand the emotion that the loss of a star can provoke, but there is no exceptional treatment,” he told Agence France-Presse.The new guide, which received a relatively low-key launch in Paris, contains 3,439 restaurant listings in France and Monaco, 628 of them starred. New three-star ratings went to Christopher Coutanceau, who has a seafood restaurant in La Rochelle, Kei Kobayashi, the Japanese-born chef at Kei restaurant in Paris, and L’Oustau de Baumanière, a family restaurant at Les-baux-de-Provence that lost its third star in 1954.There were 11 restaurants given two stars for the first time and 49 new one-star restaurants.The star ranking for restaurants was introduced in 1931. One for “high quality” cooking, two for “excellent”, and three for “exceptional cuisine”.Michelin’s turbulent last 12 months followed its downgrading of three of its three-star restaurants in the 2019 guide: Auberge de l’Ill in Alsace, which had boasted three stars for half a century, the Parisian restaurant l’Astrance and – most controversially – Marc Veyrat’s Alpine restaurant La Maison des Bois, which had been given a third star just a year previously.Veyrat sued the guide after he said one of its inspectors made the “profoundly offensive” suggestion that he had used British cheese in a soufflé and demanded to see the inspector’s notes. He lost the case to Michelin, who called Veyrat a “narcissistic a”.The guide was started 120 years ago by the tyre company founders André and Édouard Michelin, who published a travel book to encourage motorists to explore more of France. The first run of 35,000 copies including maps, advice on changing tyres, a list of petrol stations, garages and hotels, quickly sold out and similar guides were produced for Belgium, Germany, Portugal and Spain.Today, of the 30,000 restaurants listed, only 130 have the highest three-star ranking but a handful of French restaurant owners have in recent years given up their three stars, saying the pressure and cost of maintaining top-level kitchens is too onerous.For some it is literally a matter of life and death. In 2003, the celebrated three-star chef Bernard Loiseau shot himself after rumours his Burgundy restaurant was about to lose a star.Critics also argue that fewer and fewer diners are willing to spend a fortune on a meal.“Good gastronomy shines way outside our own borders. It is part of the art de vivre of which we are so proud,” Poullennec said at the launch. “Our inspectors regularly eat your dishes which gives our stars a real value.”Since 2005, the Michelin guide has produced editions for New York, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Tokyo, in English and Japanese. The company says more than 30m Michelin Guides have been sold worldwide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9c41d85b8ef6ffbc0a39ec0b6c37e595ad660fc/0_52_3448_2069/master/3448.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33ed1e76f664eb0b78971302d7e9b3c0","title":"bournemouth arsenal fa cup fourth round match report","story":"If this is what Mikel Arteta’s vision for Arsenal looks like, then the future is in very safe hands. First-half goals from the youth team products Bukayo Saka and Eddie Nketiah secured a first away victory for their manager since he succeeded Unai Emery and set up another trip to the south coast to play Portsmouth in the fifth round.Along with the impressive Joe Willock and Gabriel Martinelli, Arteta’s decision to field a starting lineup that featured four players aged 20 or under paid idends here with an all-action display which left Eddie Howe’s side chasing shadows at times during the first half.Despite a frenetic finish that saw the Bournemouth substitute Sam Surridge pull one back, Arsenal held on for a deserved victory that clearly delighted Arteta. “We played a really young squad because I wanted to see the reaction,” he said. “I’m very pleased because I saw a lot of things that I really liked. They have courage to make big decisions and they were terrific. That’s the difference with these kids.”Arteta won this competition with Arsenal twice as a player in 2014 and 2015 and had stressed the importance of using it as a springboard for the future before this tie. Perhaps with that in mind, he handed 20-year-old Nketiah his first start since his return from a loan spell with Leeds alongside the teenager Martinelli and the record signing Nicolas Pépé in attack, while Matteo Guendouzi and Willock were recalled in midfield. The late comeback against Chelsea last week after David Luiz’s red card in the first half offered proof of Arsenal’s growing team spirit under their new manager and that was very much in evidence in the opening exchanges here.

A driving run from Willock created the chance, with Martinelli’s perfect touch allowing Saka to hammer the ball past Mark Travers at his near post. Bournemouth’s usual approach to the FA Cup since they reached the Premier League means they have reached the fifth round only once in the last five seasons, although on this occasion Howe fielded several of his first-choice side.Yet despite the confidence-boosting victory here over Brighton in midweek which lifted spirits as they battle against relegation, the hosts struggled to find a foothold against Arsenal’s energetic young side.Willock could have doubled their lead in the 20th minute had he directed his shot either side of Travers before the midfielder’s excellent pass found Saka in acres of space on the left flank to supply a perfect cross that was tapped home by Nketiah. In response, Harry Wilson saw his effort parried away by Emiliano Martínez and Daniel Gosling then somehow failed to hit the target with a free header five minutes before the break.Arsenal’s defence, featuring Sokratis Papastathopoulos and the error-prone Shkodran Mustafi seemed to be standing firm – a relief for Arteta after a move for the Flamengo defender Pablo Mari reportedly hit the skids over the £7.5m proposed fee earlier in the day. A small pocket of visiting supporters even started chanting Mustafi’s name just before the whistle blew for half-time.Having seen his side totally outplayed, Howe sent his players out early for the second half and they responded with a vastly improved performance that finally applied some pressure on Arsenal’s defence.Mustafi was fortunate to get away with one lapse in which he collided with Martínez as he chased back, with the defender then having to leave the field on a stretcher after a long delay that resulted in eight minutes of stoppage time. Arteta later revealed Mustafi will have a scan this week on a suspected ankle injury that could yet force his hand in the transfer market. Jack Simpson almost gave Bournemouth hope soon after when his header from a corner whistled just past the post with Martínez stranded.The Arsenal manager then threw on Dani Ceballos for his first appearance since November in the week he insisted the Real Madrid loanee remains part of his plans. The 23-year-old could yet end up playing a more important role but was largely confined to defensive action here as Bournemouth turned to their top scorer, Callum Wilson, in a desperate attempt to force a replay. Their breakthrough finally came when Surridge latched on to a cross from his fellow substitute Simon Francis but it proved nothing more than a consolation in the end. “We really struggled to deal with Arsenal in the opening half-hour but, once we recovered, it was too late,” admitted Howe, who will now turn his attention to Saturday’s Premier League meeting with their fellow strugglers Aston Villa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08c7b6b120aef32331ded16e6996d6fc06146ebb/0_206_6153_3693/master/6153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9a44ff331dc2310784d26a6c3334756","title":"gary lineker interview bbc var klopp guardiola brexit licence fee","story":"The BBC presenter and former striker on how VAR must change, his views on Klopp and Guardiola, Brexit ‘lies’ and why the licence fee should be voluntaryGary Lineker is surprisingly cheerful in his kitchen. He has even made us chicken soup for lunch which, on a midwinter afternoon, is as tasty as it is comforting. The world outside might be reeling but here, in the affluent enclave of Barnes, it is easier to feel sanguine. As the BBC’s highest-paid presenter, Lineker is seemingly insulated from the world’s miseries and woes. Yet he is also one of the most politically outspoken and compassionate people in British sport and, as a waspish critic of Brexit, he is entitled to feel gloomy that the UK will leave the European Union on Friday.Instead, he is resigned to a reality he has argued against for four years. “I find it difficult to comprehend,” Lineker says. “But it’s a done deal, so get on with it now. I don’t tweet about it any more. Some people keep going on about it – but I’m not going to bother saying: ‘I told you so.’”Football is a consolation and, for the next 80 minutes, Lineker is engaging company. Britain has become even more insular but he is still in thrall to a worldly game. It hardly matters that Jürgen Klopp is German, or Pep Guardiola is from Catalonia, as Lineker celebrates the “unprecedented” football played by Liverpool and Manchester City in the last few years. Football, for all its ills, looks much less parochial than British politics and so it seems appropriate, this week, to ask Lineker more about Brexit.In his new acceptance of Brexit, can he now see any advantages in leaving the EU? “I’m hoping there will be. I haven’t seen any yet. We might become a unified nation and throw the flag around.”Lineker offers a weary smile which is soon replaced by sheer pleasure as he turns to the game he loves. “We’re seeing football that’s unprecedented for a variety of reasons but, obviously, there’s the influence of Pep and of Klopp. They’re contrasting, but they’re both exhilarating. They are certainly in the top five coaches, perhaps even the top two, in world football. Their different styles add to the rivalry. I love them both but Klopp’s probably more engaging. You can see Pep’s pretty intense in his post-match interviews. He’s hard work whereas Klopp can always put it on. I guess we’ve seen Pep’s dark side.“But what Guardiola’s done is special. He was a very young coach at Barcelona but he still transformed their players. Obviously they played a system based on Cruyff – which both Pep and I played under at Barça. That’s to make the pitch as big as you can when you’ve got the ball, and then shrink it when you haven’t. Klopp introduced his own style – this dynamic high-octane pressing game. It’s generated fitness and mental belief within his players. What Klopp did at Dortmund was remarkable and what he’s built at Liverpool is even better. He’s obviously been involved in recruitment and that’s crucial.“They’ve got lots of special players, particularly up front with the big three. But Trent is very special. He’s one of those players I watch every game and see three or four things from him that I go: ‘Oh my God.’ Like the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona with that quick corner. What a remarkable thing for a kid to do – to have that gall and bravery against some of the world’s best players. That could’ve ended up looking stupid but he’s smart. I interviewed him a year ago at his home. He was very shy and you can be kidded by a soft scouse accent but this kid’s really intelligent.”Lineker tells a story of how he lost a game of pool in Alexander-Arnold’s kitchen. “It was like his life depended on it. I could see myself in him. That competitive side. But he’s so freaky. That taught me a lot about his attitude.” Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200127-57121-gnl.fw.20200127.sj.fw2701.mp3 Has this season been overshadowed by Liverpool’s domination? “The brilliance of Liverpool has made it interesting even though they could win it in March, which is remarkable. So it’s been enthralling. But it’ll even itself out if City get their central defence sorted next season.”Is he concerned about the decline of the top two’s usual rivals? “People go: ‘What’s happened to Man United?’ But football’s cyclical and it was always going to be very difficult for United after Fergie. It’s the same at Arsenal. Soon as you lose such a massive personality, who was so dominant in running the club, it’s going to take an era, a decade or so, to turn it right. Football fans are not patient. But when it gets better again, it’ll actually be good. It’s sometimes good to suffer to savour the best moments.”Who would Lineker have loved to play for – Guardiola or Klopp? “That’s a great question. Sometimes I think Klopp, sometimes Guardiola. They both improve players but I’d be more suited to Man City. At Liverpool the front three drop a lot into midfield and that was not my great strength. I was more the side-on striker who likes to spin behind. More like Agüero. I’d score a hell of a lot of goals for City. But I would’ve adapted to Liverpool. I always think holding the ball up was difficult, but I remind myself the pitches we played on were shit.“That’s the one thing I’m envious about now. The playing surfaces today are like billiard tables. When I played, once you got past August it started cutting up. Then it got heavy. It got frosty. Then when it dried, you got bouncy. The pitches were more testing than the opposition sometimes. You get balls rattled into you, and it’s bouncing all over the place. Now it’s ‘boom-boom-boom’. It’s made the game so much better.“You also can’t just kick people any more. Imagine Messi in the 80s. Like Maradona they’d be whacking him down. One of the things I love about Messi is he never play-acts and he always tries desperately to stay on his feet. But if he’d played in the 80s, when basically you had to commit GBH to get sent off, it would have been harder. But there’ve been a lot of changes in football. The grounds are better – modern and beautiful. And it’s still loved. While there’s always a dark side to football, it’s better placed than it’s ever been.”Is Klopp’s current Liverpool side among the best teams he has seen? “Unquestionably. Man City also. Their numbers in a competitive league tell you that. The game evolves and so, if you put my team from 1990 against a modern team, we’d get murdered. But if we had time to adapt, the best players then would still be among the best now.”“I told them what I think VAR should be. The referee on the pitch needs a mate sitting with all these monitors. He’s watching the game and he lets it go, lets it go, and then he says: ‘Mate, you absolutely fucked up there. You’ve got to change that otherwise you’re going to look a complete dick.’ That stops the MaradonaThierry Henry handballs. The absolute howler. That’s all you need VAR for.”Unlike Peter Shilton, whom I interviewed recently, Lineker is admirably philosophical about Maradona’s Hand of God goal from the 1986 World Cup. “The Diego thing doesn’t bother me. Never has. He got away with it. I would never think of doing it but some Argentinian footballers grew up in the roughest conditions. They were ready to do anything to win.”Lineker laughs. “Anyway, if we’d had VAR it would have been 1-0 to us and I scored the winner. Happy days.”It is 30 years this summer since Italia 90 when Lineker and England were knocked out of the World Cup semi-finals by Germany. “I look back with a mixture of joy, because we were such a good side, and a feeling we didn’t do ourselves justice. We didn’t always play well. Cameroon were brilliant in the quarters. They outplayed us most of the game but Shilts made three world-class saves. I scored the two penalties and we won. Then Germany. I only watched it back a couple of years ago. I didn’t realise we were that good. We were the better side.“Italia 90 was a watershed for English football. Post-Hillsborough, post-Heysel, post-awful 80s hooliganism, it wasn’t just a working class sport anymore. It was the national sport for everybody. Women and the middle classes became interested. The reaction after 1986 was extraordinary but 1990 – my God.”That tournament propelled Lineker towards his role at the BBC – which is again beset by problems. “The BBC is something that I am genuinely passionate about,” Lineker says. “I’ve worked with them for 25 years. And I think it’s something we should be proud of in this country.“It’s really difficult for the BBC,” he admits. “They are the standard bearer and balance is difficult. Both the right wing and the left wing complain like mad that the BBC are biased. The truth is the BBC is full of thousands of people with varying political views. To say the BBC is fundamentally leftist, or fundamentally rightist, is wrong. It’s been a difficult time because of Brexit and people have been very tribal. But the BBC is unbelievably respected around the world.“The licence fee is our fundamental problem. You’re forced to pay it if you want a TV, and therefore it’s a tax. The public pay our salaries, so everyone is a target. I would make the licence fee voluntary. I’ve always said for a long time, I would make it voluntary. I don’t know the logistics of how it would work. You would lose some people, but at the same time you’d up the price a bit. It’s the price of a cup of coffee a week at the moment. If you put it up you could help older people, or those that can’t afford it.”Does his position at the BBC, and over Brexit, expose him to the threat of physical attack? “No, it’s remarkable. For all the grief I occasionally get on Twitter, people are a lot kinder face to face. I’ve only had one incident. About two years ago I was getting the train at Euston to Manchester. I got shoved in the back. I turned around and it was a little old lady. She’s going: ‘You let her in?’ I think she was talking about the girl who came back from Isis – which I made no comment on. She said: ‘You let her in, have her in your house. Effing this, effing that.’ She was on her way to a Tommy Robinson rally outside the BBC. But people are usually incredibly warm.”As Lineker stretches out on his sofa for a photo in his front room, I remind him he will turn 60 this year.“Yeah,” he says wryly, “but it’s just a number. I’m still in good shape. Seventy is the one to worry about. I would love another 10 years of working like this and having a good time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/109839df47b1ef3f9ce36675414c8cbf60e82f0d/0_24_6032_3619/master/6032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=653fe271f4734cf7d6be7bb2622934e7","title":"gary lineker says bbc should make licence fee voluntary","story":"The BBC licence fee should become a voluntary charge, the Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker says, in comments that are likely to cause dismay at the national broadcaster as it faces a battle with the government over its future.Lineker, the highest-paid BBC star with earnings from the corporation of £1.75m in 2018-19, told the  the licence fee was the broadcaster’s “fundamental problem” and in need of reform.“You’re forced to pay it if you want a TV, and therefore it’s a tax,” he said of the £154.50 annual charge on every household watching live television. “The public pay our salaries, so everyone is a target.”Lineker suggested the fee – which is currently enforced through the criminal courts - should become voluntary and be charged at higher rate to subsidise elderly and poorer viewers: “I would make the licence fee voluntary. I’ve always said for a long time, I would make it voluntary. I don’t know the logistics of how it would work.“You would lose some people, but at the same time you’d up the price a bit. It’s the price of a cup of coffee a week at the moment. If you put it up you could help older people, or those that can’t afford it.”Downing Street is already looking at decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee – a decision that could cost the broadcaster hundreds of millions of pounds in funding. The current licence fee system is guaranteed to exist for the next seven years, although last week BBC director general Tony Hall announced he would quit to allow his successor to negotiate the amount it can charge viewers from 2022 onwards.The BBC’s news operation is also preparing to announce deep cuts to leading programmes on Wednesday in a bid to make millions of pounds of cost savings. The corporation has already confirmed plans to scrap the award-winning Victoria Derbyshire show, while substantial redundancies are on the cards. Lineker is in negotiations about a new pay deal, with the BBC repeatedly saying his salary was below the market rate for leading football pundits on commercial rivals.

But he says the Remain campaign was “too negative”.On football, Lineker hails the current Liverpool and Manchester City teams and admits that teams of his era would be thrashed by current sides. And he reveals he has been consulted by football’s rule-making body, the International Football Association Board, about the use of VAR. Lineker is supportive of the principle and critical of the practice.Had VAR been in place in 1986, Lineker muses, Diego Maradona’s “Hand of God” goal would have been disallowed and England would have beaten Argentina."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaf2e265c1488b5f7febc583001fe33faac29c92/0_75_3550_2130/master/3550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb1bf4eb66181e49a5276df7115d09ec","title":"bournemouth v arsenal fa cup fourth round live","story":"Arsenal scored twice in an impressive first half, and by the time Bournemouth woke up it was already too lateAnd with that, I’m gone. Here’s the match report again. Bye!Yeah, tough opening period of the game for us, and that’s where we lost the match. Arsenal started brightly, we didn’t. We weren’t our best, that was very clear. We found it difficult to get pressure on the ball, we found it difficult to get on the ball, they went two goals up and it was a tough evening for us. We responded really well. With 15 minutes to go in the first half we found our gears, and from there we were fine. There were elements of our game that we need to look at and address, problems we had on the pitch that we didn’t deal with well enough, but I think it was more a feeling that wasn’t quite there today. A feeling that we had against Brighton, that we had to dig in and fight and scrap. We were losing too many duels, missing too many tackles.It’s hugely frustrating. I know the players aren’t going out there intentionally to deliver that, but it’s where we are at the moment. We’re a little bit Jekyll and Hyde, in that we can perform, we can compete, we can do everything we need to do to win games, and then sometimes that’s missing. That’s the frustrating part. From my side, I don’t quite know what’s going to turn up. The one quality we do need to show between now and the end of the season is the nasty stuff, the horrible stuff, the off-the-ball bits that we need to do. We have to deliver that. We can’t afford not to.Mikel Arteta has a chat. What, he’s asked, did he like about Arsenal’s display?I think the way we started the game, and the way they followed what we wanted to do, to generate overloads and space in the areas we wanted. In the second half we became a little bit sloppy in our passing, the rhythm was down and I didn’t like that very much. And in the second half we knew they were going to push, and we suffered a little bit and conceded a goal in the end, which made it difficult and nervous.He’s asked about Martinelli and Sako, and their combinations on the left which were a feature of the first half:We need to find different ways to generate good situations for us, and they start to understand what I’m looking for from them. I would like us to be a little bit more flexible with some things we can do, but in general with the young lads I’m really happy today.And finally, on the prospect of them plundering the transfer market this month:We are in the market and the club is trying to facilitate us one or two boys, but I don’t know. When we have something to say we will confirm it with you.This cannot be coincidence. Alright, it could be, but a really extraordinary one.Here’s Ed Aarons’ match report from the Vitality Stadium:If this is what Mikel Arteta’s vision for Arsenal’s future looks like then the club should be in very safe hands. First-half goals from youth team products Bukayo Saka and Eddie Nketiah secured a first away victory for their manager since he succeeded Unai Emery that sets up another trip to the south coast to play Portsmouth in the fifth round.Along with the impressive Joe Willock and Gabriel Martinelli, Arteta’s decision to field a starting lineup that featured four players aged 20 and under paid idends here with an all-action display that left Eddie Howe’s side chasing shadows at times during the first half.Much more here:Bournemouth weren’t great in the second half, but they were at least competitive. They threw themselves around a bit, they closed down, they denied Arsenal the space and time that helped them dominate the opening period. Arsenal looked good in the first half, but most teams would have looked good against that Bournemouth side. They also sustained a potentially serious defensive injury, with Mustafi being stretchered off, which is good or bad, depending on your perspective.90+11 mins: While the goal kick is in the air, the final whistle blows!90+10 mins: The chance! Fraser crosses, Martinez roars off his line to punch to Lewis Cook on the edge of the area, who chests down and half-volleys high!90+10 mins: They’re still going. Bournemouth have the ball, but too far from goal.90+8 mins: Surridge is booked for fouling Guendouzi. Guendouzi himself has negotiated the game without a caution, remarkably. 90+7 mins: Ceballos is closed down by Lewis Cook as he clears the ball. He goes down for a while, which is good game management or bad cheating, depending on your viewpoint.90+5 mins: The goal stands. Bournemouth have three minutes (and some more stoppage time) to lay siege to the Arsenal penalty area.90+5 mins: VAR wants to see some more replays of the goal. I can’t see any other reason for him stopping proceedings here.Francis’s cross goes through a cluster of bodies to Surridge, who takes a touch to control before tapping into the net, with Martinez grounded and irrelevant.90+3 mins: Guendouzi hits a 25-yard shot that keeps rising, clearing the bar by a foot or so.90+2 mins: Xhaka is booked for timewasting, as he dallies over a free-kick.90+2 mins: Arsenal make their final change, bringing Ainsley Maitland-Niles on for Willock.90+1 mins: There will be about eight minutes of stoppage time. Eight!89 mins: Bournemouth remain one goal away from making this interesting. Francis’s cross is thumped clear by Guendouzi.86 mins: The frustrating thing about Ceballos is that his surname very nearly means onions, but doesn’t (that would be cebollas). He thus fails to make it into a vegetable-name XI, alongside Fabrizio Ravanelli (radishes) and, um, some others I don’t know.85 mins: Arsenal win a corner now. Ceballos sends it in, it’s flicked on and then headed clear, all without anyone hurting anyone else.83 mins: Both players have recovered. There might be quite a lot of injury time here.81 mins: More injuries. This time Cook and Sokratis clash heads in the area.81 mins: Both players recover, and a couple of minutes later Gosling, from the edge of the D, has a shot that deflects off Xhaka for a corner.79 mins: More injuries. Saka goes down after a collision with Gosling, who gets up, runs on and collides with Guendouzi. 77 mins: A spell of Bournemouth possession in their own half ends with Cook, under pressure from Nketiah, passing out of play for a corner. Matt Stephens writes: “A comfortable away victory, a clean sheet and a Mustafi injury. Surely I am dreaming!”76 mins: That’s Simpson’s last contribution to the game. He and Harry Wilson come off, and Callum Wilson and Simon Francis are on.75 mins: Simpson and Bellerin both go for a lofted pass on the Bournemouth left. Bellerin wins it in the air, and Simpson jumps into him. The Arsenal player is receiving treatment.73 mins: This game is still being played at a decent tempo, but it’s becoming increasingly apparent that one team knows it no longer has to score, and the other no longer knows how to score.70 mins: It is absolutely tipping down in Bournemouth now. Arsenal take off Pepe, and bring on Dani Ceballos.68 mins: Bellerin surges forwards. Just back from a lengthy injury lay-off, the Spaniard scored a late goal in his comeback game at Chelsea and is sprinting 70 yards at this stage of this one, which seems admirable.66 mins: Oooooh! Martinez comes out and flaps at the corner, and Simpson heads just wide of the empty net!66 mins: Another corner. The home fans are starting to believe.65 mins: Holding’s first task is to concede a corner. Sokratis heads it clear.62 mins: Mustafi departs on the stretcher and is taken straight down the tunnel. Holding is on.61 mins: Mustafi will play no more. A stretcher has been brought on, and Rob Holding is being readied.60 mins: It did look like Mustafi landed very awkwardly on his left foot, and that his ankle might very well be genuinely sore. Though of course he could just be timewasting.58 mins: The ball bounces towards Arsenal’s penalty area, with Solanke bustling around threateningly. Martinez comes out and goes to head it, Mustafi beats him to it, and the defender ends up on the ground, clutching his left shin. Bournemouth don’t profit from all of this panic.57 mins: The home fans are now booing Martinelli, because of his play-acting, and Guendouzi, because he and Gosling aren’t playing nice.57 mins: Guendouzi brings down Lewis Cook. There was hardly any contact, which is presumably why the referee didn’t get out his book for a player who has been booking-bound since the very early stages.54 mins: Bournemouth send a fine ball into the area, but Martinelli - who not only didn’t have a head injury a few minutes back, but no injury at all - heads clear.53 mins: Guendouzi goes to pick up a dead ball, at which Gosling tries to stamp on it, and the two players square up. It was Bournemouth’s ball, so Guendouzi should probably have kept his hands off it, but Gosling’s attempt to take it seemed a little over-aggressive.51 mins: Play continues for an age with Martinelli on the turf, apparently hurt. Arsenal attack for a while, then Bournemouth win the ball and have a go. Eventually the referee stops play though it’s hard to see why, there not being a head injury to worry about.47 mins: Obviously Bournemouth will be needing a goal soonish, and not to concede again, if they are to have a chance here. Arsenal though have the first attack of the half, and the first corner, which is competently defended.The players are back out and ready for more. A goal and an assist for Bukayo Saka already, and he’s outassisting his teammates this season by a convincing margin.45+3 mins: Bournemouth demonstrated in the closing stages of the half that this could have been an exciting and closely-contested Cup tie, had they not conceded twice and played like a gang of absolute pranksters for the best part of 40 minutes beforehand.45+1 mins: There’ll be a couple of minutes of stoppage time. They start with Harry Wilson becoming the night’s first cautionee, after bringing Nketiah down from behind.45 mins: Bournemouth have had an encouraging five minutes. It’s a shame that the scoreline is so discouraging already, but still. They win a corner, but waste it miserably.44 mins: Xhaka gives the ball away to Fraser, who exchanges passes with Solanke, jinks his way to the edge of the area and then slices a shot hopelessly wide.41 mins: Bournemouth have woken up! Fraser passes to the overlapping Simpson, whose pull-back is booted clear by Xhaka.39 mins: Another Bournemouth shot! This time Wilson (H) crosses from the right and Gosling meets it, though unfortunately he meets it with his shoulder and the ball loops over the bar.38 mins: Shot! By Bournemouth! Fraser’s cross from the left flicks off a head to Harry Wilson, beyond the far post, whose volley towards the near post is saved by Emiliano Martinez.37 mins: Gosling steals the ball from Sokratis, who presumably had forgotten that there were any Bournemouth players, so rarely have they bothered him, but Bournemouth fail to capitalise.35 mins: Simpson does well to stop Nketiah reaching Guendouzi’s through-ball. “Arsenal’s search to replace Mustafi is over,” trills Charles Antaki. “There’s a chap on the field, also called Mustafi, who seems to be a reincarnation of Franco Baresi and Franz Beckenbauer. Sign him up, Mikel!”33 mins: Pepe distracts every defender in the neighbourhood and then passes to Bellerin, now alone on the right, who has time to measure his cross but Cook wins the battle to put a head on it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04f43a13c659d7f2d1af7693a3c3cf1b6bc87a9e/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abf8106e70dd5ca22792dc263ab1b973","title":"fa cup fifth round draw live","story":" Liverpool (if they qualify), Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal will all play away in round five Wayne Rooney has been handed the chance of facing his former club – if Derby County can overcome Northampton in their FA Cup fourth-round replay.Manchester United were paired with a trip to either Rooney’s current Championship side or Keith Curle’s League Two Northampton in the fifth round draw.

Experts at the animal-computer interaction lab at the Open University (OU) are close to finding out. There, animal behaviour specialists work with designers to create the kind of technology that helps animals communicate and work alongside humans more naturally – to raise the alarm if an owner falls ill, put a wash on, or switch out the lights for an owner who has a disability.“If you give animals more of a voice, they can make themselves better understood. It’s as though they can talk back to us – and this can be very valuable,” says Clara Mancini, a communication and design expert who founded the lab back in 2011. “We are researching with them, allowing animals to participate in the design process.”This is a niche area of an already niche field – but dozens of master’s at UK universities relate to animal behaviour in some form some research-led, some practical.Working closely with charities, the OU’s lab has collaborated with the likes of Dogs for Good and Medical Detection Dogs. Traditionally, medical detection dogs trained to sniff out cancerous cells have learned to sit down in front of positive samples. But for a dog, this is an unnatural response to an exciting smell, says Mancini, and limits what they can reveal. Her team have created a sort of sniffing platform with pressure pads that measures a dog’s spontaneous response to an odour. Mancini hopes this will allow scientists to detect more nuances in a dog’s reaction, revealing more about the stage or concentration of the cancer, for example. Other projects include designing an alarm – in the shape of a sausage, no less – that an assistance dog could pull if a diabetic owner suffers a hypoglycaemic attack. Researchers have also designed large snout-friendly buttons for assistance dogs in the home.While the OU’s lab is unique in the UK, the University of Stirling is also offering a master’s in human animal interaction. Many taught courses, such as a new master’s in animal behaviour at the University of St Andrews, aim to act as a springboard into a research career. Students at Exeter’s MSc in animal behaviour spend a week on Lundy Island observing abundant wildlife, including puffins, guillemots, razorbills and kittiwakes, not to mention the island’s rare breed Soay sheep, says programme director Dr Lisa Leaver, an animal behaviour expert with a background in psychology who founded the course in 2003. “Most of our graduates go on to do PhDs,” she says.“Some work in science education departments in zoos, or go on to teach, or work with conservation charities.” A research apprenticeship forms a significant part of the course, she says, with subjects as varied as social structure of killer whale groups to male signalling of fiddler crabs on Portuguese beaches.Understanding animals better has wider moral implications, Mancini believes. “We tend only to listen to our own voice and that’s dangerous. We have forgotten we are part of something bigger – and if we don’t adjust our perspective, we are eventually going to destroy the planet.”Lauren Samet, 33, is about to complete her PhD in animal welfare and nutrition. Interview by Helena PozniakI still pinch myself that I’m here. I’ve always loved animals and wanted to help make a positive change. I’m the first person in my family to go to university. After I graduated in biological sciences from the University of East Anglia, I applied to all the big animal charities – to zoos and to conservation organisations. But animal welfare is so competitive, you need a specialist qualification.I saved up to take an MSc in animal welfare at Northampton University. It was right up my street, I loved the research element. My supervisor gave me confidence and encouragement to take on a PhD – I never even thought I’d do a master’s, let alone research. During my PhD I’ve worked part-time as a nutritionist for Marwell Zoo for a year on maternity leave cover, which was an amazing experience as those jobs are like gold dust. I’ve also worked as a pet nutritionist in Yorkshire and lectured on an animal science degree.My research looks at anxiety in dogs and whether herbal supplements actually do have a calming effect. I joined the research team of the Dogs Trust in spring. This is the kind of work I wanted when I first graduated, but I now realise I needed to take the research route to get here. When we are collecting data, we work directly with dogs. Our team is running a groundbreaking longitudinal study looking at dog health, welfare and behaviour. I’m working to develop a tool that measures the bond between humans and animals.At this level you can carry out research that’s needed to support positive policy changes, as well as having an impact on the welfare of thousands of animals. This is my dream job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d77c9a350bd77478321525a09eed8cc6af38f3/0_517_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcc7368196d4b681607e118575c12f79","title":"how has your workplace treated bereaved parents","story":"As paid leave for bereaved parents is being introduced under Jack’s Law, we want to hear what parents experienced at work after they lost a childBereaved parents are now entitled to two weeks’ paid leave from work under the new Jack’s Law.We want to hear from bereaved parents who had to juggle the grief, trauma and practicalities of their child’s death with the demands of their employers.

Is it time to turn them all off for good?Three years ago, Aishah Iqbal had just qualified as a doctor and was finding it a “steep learning curve”. She often felt overwhelmed at work – and whenever she took out her phone and saw “all these messages coming up”, she felt worse. “It was very easy to get distracted from why I’d pulled my phone out, or to feel like there were so many people that I needed to reply to immediately.”When we talk about the fragmenting effect of technology on our attention, or the dopamine hits that keep us refreshing our feeds as if they are buttons on fruit machines, we are often thinking about notifications: the pings, pop-ups and glowing red dots that pull us back into our phones, and push us from app to app.According to one small study conducted in 2014, mobile phone users receive an average of 63.5 alerts every day, with most viewed within minutes – whether the phone is on silent or not. A 2016 study by Deloitte found that people check their phone, on average, 47 times a day – often in response to alerts. It is hardly any wonder some people are undergoing a notification detox.These might be messages from friends, family, your boss or your bank. They might be breaking news alerts, or reminders to drink water or meditate, or simply apps alerting you to their presence on your phone. (Turn those ones off, right now.)Regardless of what the notifications say or if you opted to receive them, the cumulative effect can be overwhelming. Over the course of a day, notifications are an interruption, affecting your focus and performance.A 2015 study from Florida State University found that, among students sitting a test that required their sustained attention, any audible interruption from their phone negatively affected the results. Just hearing the ping of a notification was equally as distracting as actually taking a phone call, suggesting to the researchers that “mobile phones can disrupt attention performance even if one does not interact with the device”.It is that sense of being derailed that is increasingly leading people to turn off all (or nearly all) of their notifications. As Iqbal noticed the effect pop-ups were having on her peace of mind and productivity, she took action. “I turned everything off, and I felt better for it. That was something I could control: the distraction coming from my phone.”Iqbal, 28, now works as a paediatrician in Leicester. She is also a certified personal trainer and uses social media as a core part of her business. She manages this by only enabling badge notifications (a red dot on the icon on the homescreen, one of the least obtrusive options) for WhatsApp and one of her email addresses. She says she is less inclined to waste hours passively scrolling Facebook or Instagram after being erted there by an alert, and she no longer feels she has to reply to messages instantly. “It hasn’t crossed my mind to turn them back on.”It is only relatively recently that turning off notifications has been an option at all. After proudly publicising the 7.4tn notifications pushed through its servers in 2013, in 2018 Apple introduced features to grant users more control over how and when they were interrupted, such as a “do not disturb” function to help them “stay in the moment”. Google has rolled out similar “digital wellbeing” features for Android. Even Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, owned up to having “gutted” his own notifications, and encouraged all iPhone users to do the same. “It’s not something that is adding value to my life, or is making me a better person.”But what if it is not the technology, but ourselves that is the problem? Nir Eyal, a behavioural design expert and author of Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life says that the leading causes of distraction are internal triggers: uncertainty, stress, anxiety and fatigue. Rather than reckon with them, it can be easier to blame technology. Developers’ tactics to get us to use their apps are good, “but they’re not mind control. A lot of people like to think we’re puppets on strings. ‘Addiction’ gets tossed around all the time, but when we call it what it really is – a distraction – it becomes something we can do something about, and there’s no one to blame.”Rather than relying on willpower, Eyal favours a system (in his case, almost a microschedule) to get ahead of ersions before they happen. He says sometimes we might blame an alert from our phone for distracting us, when really we were not focused or being productive in the first place. “It’s not just about turning off notifications, it’s about knowing what you want to do with your time. You can’t call something a distraction unless you know what it is distracting you from.”Tinkering with tech also saves us from having to confront a more grim possibility: that even if it was taken off us entirely, we would still find means of distracting ourselves.Nilli Lavie, a professor of psychology and brain sciences at UCL’s Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, says her research has established a clear link between people being distracted by their mobile phones and low mood – but a very strong association was also recorded with a wandering mind in general.Another line of research has led Lavie to conclude that susceptibility to being distracted is in fact a trait – Lavie calls it “attention distractability” – that varies within the population. Though it is not yet known if, for instance, it is influenced by genetics, it is an established component of research into attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). You may not meet the clinical criteria for ADHD, but if you fall higher on what Lavie calls “the inattention spectrum”, you will be not only more vulnerable to distractions, but more consumed by them.Lavie, like Eyal, is deeply sceptical of the argument that the problem is technology: “It’s very easy to just mute it, right?” she says. Instead there is a “generalised issue of distractability”. “Obviously mobile phones do come through as a large source of distraction, but our studies also showed it’s a wider issue.”For example, says Eyal, people feeling overwhelmed might locate tech as the source when really it is their attitude to work – or their employer’s. If your boss was to call you on a landline late on a Friday night, asks Eyal: “Is it the telephone that’s at fault or the company culture that allows for that type of behaviour?”Employees of Slack, a corporate instant messaging platform that is often cited as a source of “notification spam”, are told not to use it after hours or on weekends, says Eyal – the message from the top being “work hard and go home”. It may not be notifications that we need to manage, but expectations: those of other people, and our own.When Melissa Webb, a secondary school teacher in Lincolnshire, changed jobs three years ago, her new employer’s always-on culture exacerbated her anxiety and depression to the point where she had what she terms a “breakdown”. The constant emails from parents, students and colleagues manifested as notifications – “an enormous trigger” for her at that time, she remembers.“When you’re going through mental health problems, day-to-day life is really difficult, and you might not be in the space to properly respond to someone,” she says. “I think the notifications were symbolic of the expectation that other people had of me.“You suddenly became aware that you need to be a good employee, good colleague, daughter, partner, friend. It linked into this thing of ‘I can’t be all of these things to all of these people I can’t manage this workload, this social life.’ It was too much. Sometimes the content of them doesn’t matter – it’s just the feeling that you can’t escape.”Webb, 29, is now a self-employed illustrator. She has 43,000 followers on Instagram, with whom she has frank conversations about mental health. “I’ve had very few people in real life that I’ve been able to do that with,” she says. “I never moan about tech – tech is amazing. It’s the reason why, in the last three years, I’ve been able to earn money despite not being able to be in a normal workplace.”Her notifications, however, remain mostly switched off. “It’s so simple, but it’s so helpful. It’s that feeling of being in control of your time and your energy and your emotions, which I think is really important.” Iqbal actively guards those boundaries too. About a month ago, Instagram started alerting her to direct messages. “That went off straight away. I don’t know why it happened – but it was a reminder of why I’d turned it off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eda873838f940582d1210dcf51900efad3fa8c9b/0_469_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dae5fec7edc41f83e7278dd9c95a650","title":"the truth about hydration should you drink eight glasses of water a day","story":"The 8x8 rule has become a health goal for many. But when it comes to healthy skin, eyes and having bags of energy, the research tells another storyBefore you read this article, can I just check you’ve drunk enough water today? You might want to refill your bottle because, remember, if you wait until you feel thirsty, you may already be dehydrated. No one is sure where this advice came from, but it’s all over the internet.As we get older, our sense of thirst can get fuzzier and that is when dehydration can become a threat. It is a similar story for children, too. So perhaps the advice to drink water before you feel thirsty was originally aimed at parents and the elderly but now healthy adults are putting away gallons of water in a quest to be their best selves.There is a dearth of facts when it comes to hydration. Pharmaceutical companies aren’t interested in researching the benefits of a free resource and dehydration isn’t a pressing public health issue requiring government funding. This leaves a profitable grey area for the drinks industry to exploit. Water is, it would have us believe, a purifying fast-track to glowing skin, bright eyes and bags of energy. Galloway says detoxing with water is “a load of rubbish. Your kidneys do a very good job of sorting out what you need to retain and what you need to get rid of.”Will water make your skin better? While dehydration isn’t good for your skin, says Bav Shergill, a consultant dermatologist and honorary senior lecturer at the University of Manchester, “once you hit a certain level of fluid intake, providing you are healthy, any excess water will be peed out.”That is, unless you drink more than you can pee. Amanda Burls, an emeritus professor of public health at City, University of London, warns that drinking too much water can kill. Water intoxication occurs when the amount of electrolytes in the body becomes imbalanced by excessive water intake, disrupting brain function.Dehydration is said to be the most common cause of headaches and in 2015, Burls wrote a critical appraisal of the evidence. She concluded: “Chronic mild dehydration may trigger headaches. Increased water intake could help. A small trial shows modest benefit however, a larger, methodologically sound, randomised controlled trial is needed to confirm efficacy.” There is that grey area again.In the US, popular advice is to drink eight, 8-ounce glasses of water – about 2 litres – a day: the “8x8 rule”that originated from a recommendation by the nutritionist Dr Fredrick J Stare in 1974 (he actually suggested six to eight glasses).In the UK, the NHS recommends six to eight glasses, or up to 1.2 litres of “fluids” daily, pointing out that we obtain fluids from food. But it is the 8x8 rule that has become a health-goal meme with “the 8x8 challenge”.How much you need to drink is governed by how active you are, the weather and your physiology. Tellingly, if you seek water-consumption advice from a quietly reputable US source such as Harvard Medical School, instead of the 8x8 rule, you get “four to six cups” a day for healthy adults and all beverages count, even diuretics such as coffee, tea and booze. Don’t they make us pee more so we end up dehydrated?In 2016, Galloway tested the hydrating potential of a range of drinks and found a litre of beer was no less hydrating than a litre of water. Similarly, a litre of instant coffee, containing 212mg of caffeine, was as hydrating as water. Milk was even more hydrating, and effective as a hydration solution for people with diarrhoea. While not a green-light to binge on high-calorie drinks, it’s good to know that a cup of tea or half a lager still count as water intake.How many of us are seriously dehydrated? No one knows but Galloway once studied fluid intake among workers in a Cardiff call centre and found that, to keep their ratings up, many would restrict their fluid intake to avoid loo breaks. “We imagine similar behaviour with long-distance lorry drivers,” he says. If we’re ingesting enough water, he adds, we should probably be going to the loo “somewhere between five and seven times a day”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/469d1fd07d9b682d2e95cb934df93cc806dc0073/0_198_4246_2548/master/4246.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be6709ef5c7ba5d8eaf608d2e695c0dd","title":"ministers snub proposals to fund public interest reporting","story":"Lady Morgan says government cash would damage press freedomMinisters have rejected proposals that state funding should be used to support public-interest journalism in the UK, saying that intervention by the government would damage a free press.Last year’s official review into the future of public interest journalism by Dame Frances Cairncross, which painted a dire picture of the financial state of British journalism, suggested it would be necessary for the state to support reporting considered essential to a functioning democracy.The official response from the culture secretary, Lady Morgan, largely rejected direct intervention. “It is of vital importance that the press remains free and independent of government, and there are therefore areas where intervention by government would be inappropriate,” she said.Cairncross had suggested the government should found a new Institute for Public Interest News to coordinate between publishers, broadcasters, and online platforms to ensure a future for quality reporting.But the government’s response – issued almost 12 months after the initial proposals – said it would not be taking forward the idea: “It is not for the government to define what qualifies as ‘public interest’ news. While any institute would be at arm’s length from government, we recognise concerns that even an arm’s length relationship risks perceptions of inappropriate government interference with the press.”The government also rejected proposals to extend charitable status to many struggling local news outlets, saying it would not be appropriate because they would be banned from supporting political parties, stopped from being for-profit, and much journalism does not work “only for the public benefit”.However, ministers are looking at whether to extend certain tax breaks to cover aspects of the news business. This could include effectively removing the VAT charged on online news subscriptions to bring it in line with printed newspapers, a move which would benefit the likes of News UK which recently won a long-running legal victory against the taxman on this point.Ministers have instead limited their financial commitment to giving a £1,500 discount on business rates for office space occupied by local newspapers in England, while also confirming previously-announced plans to award £2m of funding through the arms-length body Nesta to encourage innovation in the news industry. The government cash will be used to “invest in new technological prototypes, start-ups and innovative business models to explore new ways of sustaining the press in a changing landscape”, rather than subsidising existing operators.Instead, the government is encouraging the BBC to expand its licence-fee funded local democracy reporter scheme, while awaiting the competition regulator’s investigation into the online advertising market.Henry Faure Walker, chairman of the industry lobby group News Media Association, said he was “disappointed at the lack of clear financial commitment by the government to implement the recommendations”, warning that the new innovation fund appears to be bypassing traditional local news publishers.“Without swift and significant market intervention now, the flow of independent, high-quality local news and information which is essential for the functioning of our democracy can no longer be guaranteed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e31b408ff71bf6c9a2179d674e46f30078afc97/0_68_2333_1400/master/2333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=525d12543edf5d59fd35f9f8d94dd785","title":"brexit explained how it happened and what comes next","story":"Confused by the whole 1,300-day Brexit saga? This summary sets out how and why it happened, and what can be expected in 2020 and beyondby  Jon Henley in Paris,  Jennifer Rankin in Brussels, and  Lisa O\u0027CarrollWhere to start? There’s geography: Britain is an island, and has been since geologically Brexiting from the continent 8,000 years ago. And history: unlike most of western Europe, it has not spent the past few centuries as a battlefield. Its history, rather, is global and imperial.That, plus second world war heroics, has given it a profound sense of exceptionalism, reinforced by relative economic success and an overwhelmingly Eurosceptic popular press that adores dripping corrosive untruths about Brussels.All this eventually combined to create the impression that the EU was essentially an anti-British plot: something that was somehow done to us. Hardline Tory Euroscepticism emerged with Margaret Thatcher’s Bruges speech of 1988, hounded the party into opposition in the 1990s, and returned with a vengeance once Conservative rule was restored in 2010.Amid the bitter fallout of the financial crash, mounting public concern over immigration and a political threat from the right in the form of Nigel Farage’s anti-EU Ukip party led David Cameron to promise an in-out Brexit referendum if he won the 2015 election.Three years of exhausting stalemate set in, as parliament refused to muster a majority in favour of a withdrawal deal mired in uncertainty chiefly over the future status of Northern Ireland.In short, a meeting in a wedding venue in the Wirral on a cold day in October 2019.Boris Johnson and Irish premier Leo Varadkar broke the impasse with an agreement on what to do about the tricky land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.This frontier had become a 300-mile stumbling block for Theresa May, who was unable to broker an agreement on how to take Northern Ireland out of the EU without reinstating unworkable – and unpalatable – border checks.Johnson and Varadkar essentially agreed to shift the border checks to between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.The deal is not popular in Northern Ireland. But it is one that commands the support of the Conservative party and its 80-strong majority. So, after it was approved by MPs in December and is ratified in the European parliament and Westminster later this week, it will bring the final curtain down on 47 years of EU membership at 11pm on 31 January.“Yes, but”. At the stroke of 11pm on 31 January (midnight in Brussels), the UK ceases to be a member of the EU. The orce is sealed. The only way back is an application to rejoin.But many people may not notice the difference, as the UK enters an 11-month transition period to allow time to negotiate a new relationship. That means staying in the EU single market, its customs union and paying into its budget. British citizens can continue to live, work, study and retire to the EU, while EU27 nationals enjoy those reciprocal rights in the UK.A more significant moment could be 1 January 2021, the UK’s first day outside EU rules. Under the Brexit withdrawal agreement, that day could be delayed until 2022 or 2023, but Johnson has ruled out any extension of the transition period.Life will carry on as normal for iniduals with one key change – UK citizens, from 11pm, will no longer be EU citizens.British passport holders will continue to be able to travel and work in the EU because the country remains in the single market for the transition period up to 31 December and the freedom of movement of goods, people, services and capital over borders applies until then.The main change is legal and institutional. The article 50 process is over and non-reversible. Friday is the point of no return to the EU.The UK will continue to follow EU rules, but have no say in making them. British ministers will play no part in the EU law-making process. The prime minister will cease attending EU summits to set the bloc’s priorities.The UK’s 73 MEPs will be sent home, with one of the parliament’s union jacks dispatched to the EU-funded House of History. The last UK commissioner, Julian King, has already said goodbye to Brussels. The EU will move on without Britain.Over 47 years, British governments cheered liberal economic policies (above all the single market), promoted EU enlargement, invented regional policy subsidies for poorer regions, pushed reform of fisheries and farming, watered down some environmental protection laws (and championed others), while avoiding the euro and the Schengen passport-free zone.The UK had “the best possible world”, concluded one veteran French diplomat. Now it’s gone.After almost half a century of membership, the departure from the EU is a historic event. But the prime minister has to be careful about not deepening the isions in the country by being too celebratory and has instead chosen a series of toned-down events to mark the occasion.Instead of Big Ben chiming out as the UK officially leaves at 11pm on Friday, a clock counting down be projected on to No 10 Downing Street.And an effort to convey the Tory party’s commitment to “levelling up” the country, a special cabinet meeting will be head in an as-yet-undisclosed location in the north of England.The union jack will fly from all flagpoles in Parliament Square but there will be no emblematic lowering of the EU flag.A commemorative Brexit 50p coin with the words “peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations” will come into circulation. New stamps marking the occasion are also in the pipeline.Farage and the Leave Means Leave campaign are hosting a party for the countdown in Parliament Square, with Brexiters encouraged to go in fancy dress.There is no official wake for remainers but  readers have shared their private plans to mark the momentous day.There is a set timetable for the year with negotiations expected to formally kick off after 25 February.By 1 July there must be a deal on fisheries and a UK decision on whether to ask for an extension to the transition period.Johnson has urged Brussels to fast-track trade talks, but the EU moves at its own pace. Draft negotiating mandates are due to be produced by 1 February and EU ministers are expected to approve a mandate for the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on 25 February, allowing formal talks to begin soon after.These talks will be unprecedented, and could cover a vast sweep of policies, including trade, security, foreign affairs, data, fisheries, cultural-educational ties and much more.However, with just 11 months to negotiate, the chances are there will only be a “bare bones” deal likely covering trade, fisheries and security. If that is the case, then, at the end of 2020, there will be a lot of unfinished business. Differing aspirations for the trade talks have raised the prospect of a new no-deal scenario at the end of this year.Leaving the transition period without a trade deal would not lead to the major diplomatic bust-up that failure on the Brexit withdrawal agreement would have done.It would have huge domestic consequences, however, with representatives of the car industry, hospitals, agriculture and directors already expressing alarm over Sajid Javid’s declaration that the UK will not follow EU rules, which will cause hold-ups in Dover and Calais and possibly lead to businesses quitting the country.In the absence of a deal, the earlier accord on citizens’ rights, money and the Irish border remains intact.The special arrangements that apply in Northern Ireland will kick in, deal or no deal.Both sides would brace themselves for the economic shock of trading on World Trade Organization terms, an outcome that is more damaging for the UK. But talks would roll on.Top of the list is a trade deal to ensure the tariff and quota-free flow of goods between the EU and UK. But the EU will only agree to zero tariffs and zero quotas if the UK pledges zero dumping – that is, not lowering social and environmental standards to outcompete the EU.Negotiators will almost certainly clash over the EU’s refusal to bring services into the trade deal, leaving the City of London reliant on a patchwork of market access agreements that can be withdrawn at any moment.Another early fight will be over fish, as the EU seeks to link goods trade to maintaining the status quo on access to British waters, a demand seen as outrageous in London.The non-trade topics sound easier, but are full of political landmines. For instance, agreeing a replacement for the European arrest warrant will require Germany to change its constitution. The UK will struggle to achieve the historic first of securing outside access to some EU crime-fighting databases.It depends who you ask. In the short term, much of the risk seems to have been priced in, at least on currency markets, where sterling still languishes compared to where it was in June 2016. The stock market is well ahead.A slightly more certain outlook could allow business investment to recover, after years of lagging behind Britain’s G7 peers. But against that must be weighed the unpredictability of the looming trade talks.The EU has always expressed regret at Britain’s decision to leave, repeating as long as legally possible throughout the Brexit process that the door was still open should the UK change its mind and, more recently, that it could always reapply after leaving.But the bloc has also robustly defended its interests, in particular the integrity of the single market, insisting, with unexpected unanimity, that Britain could not “have its cake and eat it” by retaining the benefits of EU membership while erging from its rules.Frustration mounted at what the EU27 saw as the UK’s reluctance to accept the real-world consequences of the vote to leave, its inability to agree on what kind of Brexit it wanted, and of course the long months of parliamentary psychodrama and paralysis that ensued.Some countries (France) have taken a much tougher line than others some (the Netherlands, Denmark) will suffer much more from a no-trade-deal Brexit. But the EU27 should maintain their unity during the future relationship talks: however much of a blow a hard Brexit may be, a weakened single market is a far more damaging prospect.No one yet fully knows much remains to be negotiated. The withdrawal agreement secures British citizens’ basic rights to live and work within their EU host countries, a broadly similar post-Brexit status in each country, and EU-wide coordination on reciprocal healthcare and social security.During the 11-month transition period, because the UK will remain in the single market, Britons will retain the freedom to move within the EU as before. After it ends they will have the right – providing they register, or in some countries apply, within a given time limit – to stay and, after a time, seek permanent residence.Some rights within the gift of the UK are not yet assured either, such as home fees for British students on the continent who wish to study in the UK, and family reunification rights for Britons returning to the UK with EU family members.Many British voters who were passionate about staying in the EU will be feeling upset and emotional at 11pm on 31 January. While life goes on as normal in general, it is the point of no return and from 1 February British citizens will no longer be EU citizens.But for EU nationals in the UK the moment will cast a long shadow of material consequence. While the government has given assurances that they will not face deportation or loss of social or employment rights, the bond of trust with the government is weak, not least because of the Windrush scandal.Although it will certainly affect the UK more than the EU in almost every respect, Brexit will undoubtedly weaken the EU economically and politically. Britain was the EU’s second-biggest economy, a major net budget contributor, key military force and one of the bloc’s two nuclear powers and permanent UN security council members.The EU’s institutions may have withstood the test of Brexit better than expected so far, and support for the EU among its citizens has generally increased. Brexit has also proved a salutary lesson, with almost all the bloc’s nationalist and Eurosceptic parties dropping promises to follow the UK’s example.But the UK’s departure has distracted attention from a number of other big and urgent problems, including the climate crisis, and settling on the new relationship is also likely to be a messy and debilitating process. Longer term, in the balance of global powers a smaller, fractured Europe is obviously a weaker Europe.In the face of an aggressive China and an increasingly protectionist and unpredictable US, the EU will need to be significantly tougher, with a centralised foreign policy and stronger rules ensuring European companies can compete with overseas rivals. Brexit makes that imperative even more urgent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cc70c03dff5c69951b3a1ae78e8cbfe54927c77/0_141_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4acd2ac43f8f785c49ff47f120cf7376","title":"peak meat is veganism the future","story":"Marco Springmann, a public health expert, tells Anushka Asthana why cutting out animal products is the best route to a healthy diet – and why veganism is good for the planet.

The site had been evacuated by the Nazis just days earlier. Thus ended the largest mass murder in a single location in human history. Precise numbers are still debated, but according to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, the German SS systematically killed at least 960,000 of the 1.1 million to 1.3 million Jews sent to the camp. Other victims included approximately 74,000 Poles, 21,000 Roma, 15,000 Soviet PoWs and at least 10,000 from other nationalities.

I always tell the truth,” Barnier said in response to questions from the media on whether checks could be lifted. When asked how he felt about Johnson’s repeated claims there would be no checks, he replied: “I know what is written in this text.”In his speech, he said: “I understand the fears of negative economic fallout expressed by some about these checks, but Brexit unfortunately has consequences that we must manage.”He said it was the UK’s decision to quit the single market and customs union, and that “makes checks indispensable”.His comments directly contradict the prime minister’s repeated claims over the last three months that there would be no checks on goods in either direction across the Irish Sea.At one point Johnson told supporters in Northern Ireland that they could put any new paperwork “in the bin” because there would be “no forms, no checks, no barriers of any kind” on goods crossing the Irish Sea.Friday will mark the start of what is likely to be an uphill battle to get a trade deal done by the end of the year, not to mention all the non-trade issues that must also be resolved including security and intelligence cooperation, fisheries, data, education and research collaboration.Although everyday life will remain the same and the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union until the end of the year as part of transition arrangements, the withdrawal agreement will be a legally binding international treaty that comes into force. It carries sanctions for any “backsliding or half measures”, as Michel Barnier’s adviser Stefaan de Rynck has pointed out.We know little of the plans for the negotiations, and parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit has been restricted. The House of Lords EU committee has invited but failed to get Stephen Barclay to appear to explain the next stages, sources say.While business has been clamouring for the government to reveal its Brexit vision beyond the joint aspiration of a tariff-free, quota-free deal, little is known about Boris Johnson’s specific goals.Expect plenty of sabre-rattling on both sides, but negotiations are unlikely to begin before March. The European commission kicked off its 30-stage process in agreeing its negotiating goals before Christmas and these are expected to be signed off by member states at a meeting on 25 February.David Frost, who replaced Oliver Robbins as the chief negotiator, is expected to lead a team of about 30 calling on expert knowledge from civil servants and trade experts. Some have suggested the government should hire as many as possible from the Canadian team that sealed Canada’s new deal with the EU.\u0026nbspThis remains the single most contentious part of the Brexit deal because of the checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. De Rynck said in January that the EU and the UK would have to be “very disciplined” if they were to get a new system for trading in Northern Ireland ready for 31 December.Brussels and Irish political leaders are already alarmed by Johnson’s repeated declarations that there will be no checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea, even though some of these will be mandatory.Helen McEntee, Ireland’s minister for European affairs has contradicted him directly, telling Sky News’s Sophy Ridge: “There will be no checks\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland businesses have urged the government to set up a working group urgently so that the detail of the checks can be determined quickly.He repeated the claim again last week, telling Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the Democratic Unionist party leader in the House of Commons, that it was “emphatically” the case there would be unfettered trade in either direction.His claims have led to confusion among business leaders in Northern Ireland. Last week the Freight Transport Association warned that the “straightforward” paperwork that would be needed post-Brexit for goods transiting from Northern Ireland to Great Britain involved a complex form with more than 30 questions.He said many of the consequences were “not so well explained to the British people”.“There will be no possibility for frictionless trade between the EU and UK after this deal,” he added.Goods going in the other direction must be accompanied by customs declarations forms with “phytosanitary checks on food products and live animals”.Barnier warned that neither the EU or UK could backslide by simply turning a blind eye. The withdrawal agreement was legally binding and “cannot be reopened under the guise of implementation”, he said. “We will be monitoring its correct application very carefully.” Barnier also expressed bemusement over Sajid Javid’s recent remarks in a Financial Times interview that the UK would not be aligned to EU rules post-Brexit.He said he hoped “our UK friends are reflecting carefully” on the matter because the EU will not agree to a close neighbour trying to seek an unfair advantage through subsidies to industry or a removal of stringent standards to cut costs.“The UK cannot expect high-quality access to our single market if it insists on competing on state aid, social or environmental standards,” he said.After a whistlestop tour of Dublin and Belfast, in which he met the taoiseach and representatives of Sinn Féin and the DUP, Barnier said the withdrawal agreement in its current form allowed for “an orderly Brexit, for now” that “limits the destruction of value of our citizens and businesses”.As the EU and the UK count down to the formal parting of company on Friday, Barnier warned a “new clock was ticking” with just 11 months to seal a deal on trade and other issues including freedom of movement, science, Erasmus, security and financial services.After meeting Barnier in Dublin, the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, expressed sadness that Ireland’s nearest neighbour was no longer a member of the EU family.“We’ll say goodbye to an old friend embarking on an adventure,” said Varadkar. “We hope it works out for them. But if it does not, there will always be a seat kept for them at the table.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1590fc1078cbf25bf3a783281b4cb555cb507090/0_0_5661_3397/master/5661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ffe0fb67840015db807381b4fd3eeb8","title":"labour defeat due to gimmicks and division say members","story":"Review led by Ed Miliband tasked with suggesting ways the party might find a path to powerGimmicky policies, horrible inefficiency and factional promotions are among the catalogue of errors behind Labour’s dismal performance at the general election, according to party members.The damning comments on Labour’s campaign form part of an early release of views gathered by a team headed by the former party leader Ed Miliband consisting of MPs, union leaders and party members. They have tasked themselves with analysing Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign and suggesting ways the party might find a path back to power.More than 8,000 people have replied to the nationwide call for members’ experiences and reasons that led to Labour suffering its worst defeat since 1935. A full analysis of the findings will be conducted by the Labour Together Review commission after it closes on 21 February.Comments received so far include that party’s free broadband commitment felt “gimmicky and distracting” for voters. Another member who responded said they thought promotions to positions of authority were “based on nothing more than factional loyalty”.One supporter said the strategy of targeting elites was seen as “Trumpian” by voters. “Feel that our rhetoric around ‘elites’ and who we didn’t like or support made us look negative and aggressive,” they said. A phone system was also “down at the start” of the campaign and an online uploading platform described as “clunky”. One team member said: “It crashed several times and this whole area was the most stressful aspect of running the campaign.”Speaking at a campaign event in Oxford, Rebecca Long-Bailey said she didn’t think voters had rejected socialism at the general election, and that she would never apologise for the Labour manifesto. “I spent the last four years writing the policies that were contained within that manifesto … I thought it was the most hopeful manifesto I’ve ever seen.”She asserted her commitment to bringing academies back into local authority control, repealing the 2010 Health and Social Care Act and ensuring the rights of EU workers after Brexit.Reports over the weekend suggested some Labour MPs were threatening to quit the party if Long-Bailey is chosen as leader, and she emphasised the need for unity between all sides of the party. “We haven’t been a unified party, and whoever the leader becomes we have to have a united party going forward because ided parties don’t win general elections. Whether you’re a Labour member or a Labour MP I would expect you to support our chosen leader.”“As the review progresses we want to get a much deeper understanding of some of the lessons this provides for the future. Further detailed in depth analysis and listening to MPs that won, and defeated MPs and candidates, as well as the wider membership and the public will enable us to do this.”Also on the review team are Miliband, Lucy Powell MP, James Meadway, a former adviser to shadow chancellor John McDonnell, the general secretary of the TSSA union, Manuel Cortes, and Jo Platt, the former MP for Leigh.The review team met for the first time earlier this month. As well as the survey, they are holding listening events in heartland seats, examining the ground campaign, analysing the role of Facebook and social media, and looking at the part trade unions played.Each defeated Labour MP has been written to for their opinions on the election, and Labour candidates in the 124 seats the party must win to form a majority, according to analysis by the Fabian Society. The final document will also suggest ways the party can win again in the future, after suffering four election losses in 10 years.There were some positive views among the responses, with praise for the event pages for members and the Organise app, which had allowed people to communicate well. Activists’ inidual efforts were also recognised, with appraisals such as “everyone did their best”.• The “red wall” was a huge block of Labour-voting constituencies stretching from north Wales into Merseyside, through Greater Manchester along the Midlands and up to the north-east. The origin of the term is unclear but some believe it was first used in 2019.•\u0026nbsp Thirty-three Labour leaders spoke to the  and all but three supported Sir Keir Starmer or Lisa Nandy to become the party’s next leader. All of the 33 local authority areas voted for Brexit in 2016.• Of those who would disclose their least favourite candidate, all but two said Rebecca Long-Bailey. The other votes were for Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry.• Labour leaders in six of the 10 longest-held Labour seats that fell to the Tories said they were backing Starmer or Nandy. They are the Labour leaders in Rotherham, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Wigan, Bassetlaw, North East Lincolnshire and Bolsover. The other four leaders had not responded to requests for comment.The review was heavily criticised when it launched in late December for the involvement of Miliband and Powell, who lost the 2015 general election. Powell, who represents Manchester Central, was Miliband’s campaign manager.She has previously defended their roles, suggesting Miliband retained his Labour seat in the “red wall” as others fell to the Tories has been campaigning in the traditional heartland of Doncaster regularly for the past four years and has as much to offer “as the next person”.They are not due to recommend a leadership candidate to succeed Corbyn.Their report comes as Labour leadership candidates were presented with a second analysis of the election defeat from Europe for the Many, an organisation that brings together academics and campaigners. They suggest the party will not win the next election without regaining socially conservative voters but warned achieving that presents Labour with a serious challenge.Their report, The Devastating Defeat, found that in the 2019 election, voters focused on values and identity over economic policies, which advantaged the Tories, particularly in ex-heartland seats. But any rush to recapture socially conservative voters should not lead to Labour imitating Tory policies on immigration and law, they warn.This could create difficulties in managing Labour’s membership, and previous attempts to become more authoritarian – citing Gordon Brown’s “British jobs for British workers” – had lacked credibility.Abandoning all discussion of rejoining the EU was also essential for the future electoral success of Labour, the report said.Bridget Phillipson, Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, said: “To win over voters who are less socially liberal than Labour is today, but more economically leftwing than the Tories, we should not impersonate them.”Luke Cooper, an associate researcher at the LSE, said: “Brexit has created a really tough situation for Labour. By making values and identity the central questions of the day, it has broken the party’s traditional electoral coalition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youMore than 1,280 infected and 18 cities in lockdown in China as officials try to stem spread of virus which has reached Europe, the US and Australia.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission. As of 27 January, the Chinese authorities had acknowledged more than 2,700 cases and 56 deaths. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside China, in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. There have not been any confirmed cases in the UK at present, with the 14 people tested for the virus all proving negative. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities are in lockdown. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. A key concern is the range of severity of symptoms – some people appear to suffer only mild illness while others are becoming severely ill. This makes it more difficult to establish the true numbers infected and the extent of transmission between people. But the authorities will be keen to stop the spread and will be anxious that the virus could become more potent than it so far appears.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The NHS advises that there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World Health Organization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Healthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.

But atmosphere is something I am choosy about I want to go somewhere that has charm and character, somewhere that has life both on and off the piste. Just a 45-minute drive from Innsbruck, the Wildschönau and Alpbach valleys tick all of those boxes. Steeped in Tirolean culture, the mountains are dotted with pretty villages, handsome wooden farmhouses, onion dome churches and a great choice of family-run hotels and restaurants serving up hearty Austrian fare. And it’s good value too, making it an ideal choice for families and first-timers.SkiingThe Ski Juwel Alpbachtal Wildschönau is one of the larger ski regions in the Tirol, with 68 miles of pistes. At its heart are two mountains, the Wiedersbergerhorn (2,128m) and the Schatzberg (1,903m), which are linked by cable car. Between them they can cater for most levels of skier, but families and novice skiers will particularly appreciate the wide, gentle nursery slopes around the villages of Inneralpbach and Niederau. Intermediate skiers can take their pick from a variety of attractive, meandering runs, such as the 2.5 mile tree-lined run that sweeps down from the Pöglbahn station towards Inneralpbach. Those in search of more challenging terrain will find some rewarding black runs and off-piste skiing above Niederau and at the top of the Wiedersbergerhorn. There are two snow parks where boarders and skiers can work on their tricks, and you can try night skiing at the Reither Kogel, whose slopes are floodlit every Friday and Saturday from Christmas until the beginning of March.Where to stayThe villages of the Wildschönau and Alpbachtal valleys offer a perfect antidote to bland purpose-built resorts. For chocolate-box Tirolean charm, few places can rival Alpbach, which has been voted Austria’s “prettiest village”. New for this ski season is Die Alpbacherin, a four-star boutique hotel with smart rooms, a spa, infinity pool and restaurant specialising in regional food. If you want to be right on the slopes, the hamlet of Inneralpbach, a little higher up the valley, is a good option, with a smattering of family-friendly hotels, a small microbrewery and direct access to the lifts. Niederau is perfect for first-time skiers, with a string of good-value family-run hotels, many of which are a short walk to the slopes. We enjoyed the warm hospitality and excellent home-cooked food of the Wastlhof hotel in Niederau, which has spotless rooms and a great indoor pool and spa. The hotel recently opened a new wing across the road with family-friendly apartments overlooking the ski slopes.Where to eat and après-skiIf downing shots and dancing into the small hours is your idea of après-ski heaven then you might want to look elsewhere. The scene here is lowkey: think cosy mountain huts serving locally-brewed beers and hearty meals brought to your table by lederhosen-clad waiters. This is dairy farming country so cheese and cream get star billing on menus. I still daydream about the brezensuppe (pretzel soup) I tasted in the Gasthaus Thalmühle in Oberau – a rich beef broth laced with pretzels and topped with melted cheese and fried onions. Another great place to try out regional specialities is the Böglalm hut in Alpbach. On sunny winter afternoons skiers queue for schnitzel and spazln (the Austrian answer to gnocchi) cooked up in huge pans on outdoor stoves. Wash it down, like the locals do, with a shot of krautinger schnapps, which is distilled from turnips and which only a handful of families in the Wildschönau valley are licensed to make.Things to doWhen you tire of hurtling down the slopes on skis or a board, you can hurtle down them on a toboggan – there are runs in Niederau and Auffach.

Söll, perhaps the best-known of the resorts to Brits, is renowned for its night skiing, as Austria’s biggest night ski area, with five groomed pistes lit up with lights until 9.30pm, a floodlit snowpark and tobogganing day and night on special runs, plus a valley descent you can ski until 10.30pm. Ellmau, too, has night tobogganing.Every fun day on the mountain has to end with apres ski, and you’d need longer than a week to sip a spiced glühwein (mulled wine) or flügel (a popular Austrian ski drink of Red Bull, vodka and cranberry) in each village’s cosy mountain inns and slopeside hideaways. Among them are Soll’s Moonlight bar, with several levels, and Fabels in Ellmau, both with live DJs. From 7-29 March, there’s even more live music than usual for the Apres Ski Weeks festival, with folk music, jazz and rock in the mountain huts, and free ski guides on hand to lead revellers between them.The most romantic thing to do after dark has to be visiting the Alpeniglu village at Hochbrixen, where 18 igloos offer overnight stays, parties in an ice bar and an ice art and sculpture exhibition. The sudden cold that arrives at night can shock like a punch, but here guests are soon cosied up, wrapped in furs and sipping hot wine. Sundowners in the domed bar carved from ice are followed by a fondue at private ice dining tables, a snowshoe treasure hunt in the forest, or a nightcap by the campfire. Then you can snuggle into Arctic-grade sleeping bags on piles of reindeer furs where you remain toasty warm until the morning.Skiers of all levels are in for a treat here – it’s one of the biggest and most modern ski resorts in the world, with 90 cable cars and lifts accessing 176 miles of slopes across the linked ski areas of Brixen im Thale, Ellmau, Going, Hopfgarten, Itter, Kelchsau, Scheffau, Söll and Westendorf. Each resort has its own character and cool features: Westendorf has fun parks and a snowboarding scene Ellmau is known for its huge ersity of runs, remarkable viewpoints and fun parks Scheffau is great for learner pistes and easy cruising blues and Hopfgarten is the perfect place for astounding views, especially from the top of the Hohe Salve peak, home to a little pilgrimage church and where 70 peaks over 3,000m can be viewed from the top, including the Grossglockner, Austria’s highest mountain.If you’ve ever skied in one of those cranky old resorts, with lifts that break down all the time, poor piste maintenance, and shonky overpriced cafes … well, SkiWelt isn’t like that. This is a resort striving to be one of Austria’s best, constantly upgrading, and with a drive towards sustainability. Most of the resorts have snowparks, there are many long runs down to the valley, challenging steep pistes and backcountry for advanced skiers, including long scenic tours such as the SkiWelt tour, which has 21 valley runs, or perhaps your own ski safari across the whole area. But it’s perfect for first-timers and families too, with gentle beginners’ sections in each resort, and an easygoing vibe. Even the terrain has a friendly look, no scarily severe-looking peaks, just the beautiful iconic limestone outcrop that gives the SkiWelt region its identity, rising above everything.This season, a new eight-person chairlift, the Fleidingbahn, with heated seats and bubble cover, rolls into action in the SkiWelt Westendorf, up to the ski area’s highest point at 1,892 metres. In Hochbrixen, a new Zinsbergbahn lift will replace the old, combining eight-seater chairs and large gondolas, the first of its kind in the Kitzbühel Alps, which also generates photovoltaic electricity year-round. SkiWelt Brixen has a solar-powered system for snowmaking that only uses reservoir water from rainwater and snowmelt, there’s free charging for electric cars in several spots and the whole resort now relies on renewable energy. These efforts have won the region several awards. Those who want to minimise their own carbon footprint while visiting can reach SkiWelt by train from London St Pancras via Amsterdam, travelling overnight on the Alpen Express sleeper train to the gorgeous, characterful city of Kufstein nearby (worth visiting for a day in its own right, for its beautiful medieval old town, cobbled streets, towering fortress and Stollen, a cavernous, speakeasy gin bar that has the world’s largest gin gallery more than 1,000 varieties).Yet, aside from the investment in constant modernisation, this is a region soaked in the warmth of traditional Austrian hospitality. The historic mountain inns (of which there are 81) feel somehow polished yet cosy and rustic, and cater amazingly well for kids.The family-owned Kaiserhof Ellmau, for example, is right on the slopes, with a huge spa and wellness area, amazing views, kids’ club and an award-winning kitchen that’s won two prestigious Gault Millau torques for its creative twists on local classics.Others have play areas that would be paid-for attractions in their own right in the UK, with unique and witty touches that are pure magic for little ones.Across every aspect, this is an area that knows how to have fun.Find out more"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a092193e3a5864ac798c619a6dd17920a3d9453/687_328_2285_1371/master/2285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fad1cf897494b9a440ba8c3a4ae7cbc","title":"third of uk doctors report burnout and compassion fatigue","story":"BMA says medics’ wellbeing is suffering as a result of strain on NHSAlmost a third of UK doctors may be suffering from burnout, stress and “compassion fatigue”, according to a survey that has raised concern about excessive workloads in the NHS.A\u0026ampE doctors and GPs are the most likely to feel burnt out. They have the highest levels of exhaustion and stress, the survey, published in the BMJ Open journal, found.The findings of the biggest published survey of its kind underline the emotional impact on many doctors of working in an NHS that is under the most intense pressure in its 71-year history.Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, said: “Years of systemic underfunding and serious workforce shortages mean NHS doctors are working longer hours in highly pressured, understaffed environments, and their wellbeing is suffering as a result.”The findings are based on responses from 1,651 doctors who filled in a survey distributed by medical royal colleges last autumn. Respondents self-selected but included all grades and specialities of doctor from all four home nations.Their overall score for their resilience was found to be 65 out of 100, which is lower than in previous comparable research. Hospital doctors were more resilient than family doctors, and consultants were more resilient than recently qualified doctors.Doctors’ coping mechanisms included distraction from a situation and blaming themselves rather than working out how to solve a problem, which the authors said showed they were not adapting well to pressure.Many NHS trusts have responded to stress and burnout among staff by taking steps such as offering yoga, pilates and physiotherapy sessions and encouraging staff to take regular breaks.Meanwhile, a separate study has found that almost one in five doctors who deliver babies have post-traumatic stress disorder from witnessing distressing events in their work. In a survey of 1,095 UK obstetricians and gynaecologists, two-thirds said they had encountered traumatic situations during labour and birth.Many doctors who have experienced traumatic events feel unable to be open about the effect on them because of a “culture of stigma and blame”, researchers from Liverpool University found. Nine out of 10 believe a system of care should be set up to help maternity doctors.Prof Pauline Slade and colleagues found that PTSD was leading to staffing problems on maternity units because doctors affected go on sick leave, and it is a key factor in the fact that three in 10 doctors training to specialise in obstetrics give up before they qualify.The condition could also desensitise obstetricians in how they care for mothers and encourage them to intervene earlier during childbirth if problems arise with the baby, the study said.An NHS spokesperson said: “Staff are the lifeblood of the NHS, which is why we are now for the first time offering the most comprehensive national mental health support offer to doctors of any health system in the world and are committed to doing similarly with other staff groups, as part of our NHS long-term plan.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdcc359432cc8514aaca1035c5424991e89cb709/734_332_2777_1666/master/2777.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=019558e70deaa49a7c65ed703f9a0338","title":"jos buttler south africa removal england test side hasty foolish","story":"England’s golden sapling has been underperforming in South Africa but it would be silly to apply normal rules to one of the game’s most thrilling talentsSpoiler alert: it’s Joe Denly next. And then Zak Crawley. Then, it’ll be time for Ben Stokes to be taken down a peg. Then probably Dom Sibley. Then, sometime next summer, Rory Burns or Jofra Archer. Then Denly again. Welcome to the England Test team in 2020, a toxic chalice of confected jeopardy in which somebody must always be in crisis. Somebody – anybody – must always be hovering just above the trapdoor.Right now, it is Jos Buttler. Poor Jos: England’s golden sapling (and, just six months ago, their presumptive next captain in all formats) withered to a sad husk. Even as England cruised to a comfortable victory over South Africa Buttler emitted the heavy-headed dolour of a man who suspects his time may be at hand.Poor Jos. And yet, equally: this is quite poor, Jos. A batting average of 16 might just have been salvageable had his glovework passed muster but he can have few complaints if England look elsewhere for the upcoming tour of Sri Lanka. And there are plenty of people for whom this would be the ideal scenario: cutting Buttler adrift, allowing him to concentrate on being the most destructive white-ball cricketer England have ever had.There is, admittedly, a boring grown-up logic to this. The formats are drifting apart. Buttler’s red-ball record – one century in 41 Tests, a first-class average of 32 – was never that good anyway. The example of Eoin Morgan, who has not played a Test since he was 25, proves that a solely white-ball legacy is no bar to greatness. And so the argument runs that, like Alex Hales, Jason Roy and Adil Rashid, Buttler should simply be unshackled from the pinching handcuffs of Test cricket, and set free to do what he does best.At which point we must cry “Stop”. None of the following is an argument that Buttler is currently performing to standard, or that he should even necessarily keep his place. Perhaps all he needs is a break. Perhaps, ultimately, a conscious uncoupling will become inevitable. Even so, jettisoning one of the most gifted cricketers England has ever produced surely requires a moment’s extra pause.The first point to make is that there is no useful precedent here. Telling Buttler to rip up his Indian Premier League contract, go back to Lancashire and score some runs in April and May is just not the way things work any more. Besides, this is a man who walked straight back into Test cricket in 2018 after 18 months out and immediately took a fine Pakistan attack to pieces. Normal rules do not apply to Buttler and never have.One suspects, on some level, that this has always been the problem. The shrill, censorious reaction to his first-innings dismissal at Johannesburg – charging Vernon Philander and smashing the ball straight upwards – reinforced the idea that English cricket still sees batsmanship in essentially moral terms. Some dismissals are more acceptable than others. Nicking off in the channel: annoying, but essentially fine. Never mind that since the start of last summer most of Buttler’s dismissals have come either defending or leaving. A naturally aggressive batsman playing a naturally aggressive game: still, somehow, taboo.Besides, these are austere times. Gone are the exploding landmines and hailstorm collapses of the Trevor Bayliss days. In a way the grim strictures of the Joe RootChris Silverwood era are an inevitable corrective, the point at which grand dreams meet stark reality. We couldn’t stop Brexit, we can’t stop climate change and we couldn’t play white-ball cricket with a red ball. Now please, let’s try to put some runs on the board before we all die in a giant fireball.Where does Buttler fit into these straitened times? Perhaps he doesn’t. This, in a way, is the Buttler Paradox: the less important he is, the better he performs the better he performs, the more important he becomes. This is why the comparisons with AB de Villiers or MS Dhoni or even Kevin Pietersen have never quite worked. At his best Buttler is a glorious freewheeling irrelevance, a joyriding frivolity, a player who derives his essential function from having none at all.Still, no player operates in a vacuum. Over time the constant background noise of English cricket acts as a sort of tightening noose, a vortex of stern faces and statistical damnation from which there is no real escape. Remember when people used to gripe that Ian Bell made centuries only when somebody else did? Or that Jonathan Trott scored too slowly? English cricket loves nothing more than complaining, even if the cumulative effect is a kind of nonsensical cant. Play with freedom, Jos. Express yourself. But not with too much freedom or expression. Execute your full repertoire of shots without taking undue risks. Play your own game – and the situation.Buttler, for his part, has been playing pretty much solidly for a year: a period that has taken in a gruelling home World Cup, an immediate Ashes series and the birth of his first child (from whom this is his first winter away). Should his underperformance really surprise us? And if not, then why is the debate about discarding him for good rather than trying to get the best out of him?There are broader, more fundamental questions, too. Can a team accommodate a Sibley and a Buttler at once? If not, why not? What does it say about Test cricket if it cannot find a place for one of the most thrilling talents in the sport? And how do you reckon Australia feel about Buttler never playing in another Ashes?Ultimately, you feel the loss of Buttler would say as much about English cricket as it would about Buttler himself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01ab048d62ec35c148dd3965f1eb1b7db1712360/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc48966f0b57c388effb07e181e65bfe","title":"tell us about your favourite kobe bryant moment","story":"We would like to hear from you about the NBA great, who has died aged 41Kobe Bryant, the former LA Lakers star and one of the greatest basketball players of all time, has died in a helicopter crash in Los Angeles county.Over a career ning 20 seasons, Bryant won five NBA championships and two Olympic gold medals.

Here’s how to have a great time, while minimising your carbon footprintJanuary is always a struggle – cold, dark, full of broken resolutions and battered bank balances – but the beginning of 2020 has been particularly grim. From the crisis in Iran, bushfires in Australia, coronavirus and Brexit around the corner, the year could hardly have got off to a worse start. There is hope – of course – and there are holidays, too: this is peak booking time for the travel sector.Whether you already have a destination in mind, or are looking for ideas, your first port of call should be the Man in Seat 61 – an independent website covering every stage of booking trains in the UK, Europe and beyond. It includes everything you need to know about routes, fares, buying tickets, timetables and rail passes. The site was founded by Mark Smith in 2001, when cheap flights were booming and the typical seat61 user was, in his words, “afraid of flying, medically restricted from flying or particularly liked train travel”. Undeterred, Smith continued to share his tips – free – and this modest former station manager has become a guru among regular rail travellers.Not always. Door-to-door, it is quicker or as quick by train from London to Paris, Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam or Rotterdam (all direct routes on Eurostar). The Netherlands’ second largest city is tipped in  Travel’s 2020 hotlist for its architecture and progressive urban living (it’s home to the world’s first floating farm, and many hotels, restaurants and attractions support the city’s goal to be a waste-free society) – plus it’s less crowded than Amsterdam. Beyond that, yes, travelling by train takes longer – but that’s part of the appeal. This year, more of us will embrace rail travel, not just for environmental reasons, but because it’s fun. Not convinced? Pick up a copy of the latest edition of Europe By Rail, an anthology of 52 routes, from the north of Norway to southern Sicily.Instead of flying direct to Spain, the slow route might include overnight stays in Cahors (Gallo-Roman ruins and excellent red wine) and Foix (“one of those unsung but perfect-looking French towns”) before crossing the Pyrenees and passing through the Catalan countryside to Barcelona. From there, the rest of Spain awaits. At Easter, Renfe, the Spanish rail company, is introducing a new range of low-cost, high-speed trains, aimed at getting Spanish travellers off the roads, but opening up opportunities for tourists, too. Among the routes will be Barcelona to Madrid for €10.After being threatened with extinction, Europe’s night-train network is undergoing a renaissance. The driving force behind this is the Austrian state railway, ÖBB, which is expanding its Nightjet network across Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Italy into Belgium and the Netherlands. This month saw the return of a Brussels-Vienna sleeper. Departing the Belgium capital at 6pm, you will be rocked to sleep and arrive in the Austrian capital the next day at 8.30am – perfect timing for a coffee in the opulent setting of Cafe Goldegg, a five minute walk from the station. At the end of the year, ÖBB will add a route going from Amsterdam to Vienna.Unlike flights, the price of Interrail passes is fixed and children under the age of 11 go free, making it a better-value option than flying for families travelling in the peak summer months. Add in reductions for travellers under 27 and over 60, free luggage, regular deals and discounts on city attractions and Interrail looks increasingly like a modern miracle.As we leave the EU, plan your own ode to Europe – along the French and Italian rivieras, perhaps, before heading north into Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland, before returing via Berlin and Brussels. For itinerary ideas, go to thetravelinterrailing. And remember, for some trains you have to pay an additional booking fee.If poring over endless rail timetables is not your idea of fun, fear not – a growing number of tour operators are incorporating rail travel into their packages. For 2020, Sunvil has introduced Greece by rail for the first time – offering train journeys to the islands of Corfu, Paxos or Lefkas, and Parga and Sivota on the mainland, via the French Alps, Milan and Bari, from where the ferry departs. Just Sardinia and Just Corsica are also making it easier to reach islands without flying, building train and ferry crossings into their trips. Inn Travel, the walking and cycling specialist, has made all of its European mainland holidays, plus the Balearics and Sicily, available by rail, and trebled the size of its in-house rail team to cope with demand.Ferries could hardly be called green, but emissions for each passenger are considerably less than short-haul flights and the sector is endeavouring to reduce them. This year, Brittany Ferries is launching the Honfleur, its first liquified-natural-gas-powered ship, to run on the Portsmouth to Caen route, followed by the Salamanca in 2022 and the Santoña in 2023 on the Portsmouth-Bilbao service. South of Caen, connect to the Véloscénic cycle route that runs between Paris and Mont Saint-Michel, cutting across Normandy, stages of which are easy enough to do with kids.Stena Line is also investing in new technology and ships. Its rail-and-sail service to Amsterdam is an alternative to Eurostar – and a good option for families. Go to little-clogs-holidays for holiday park suggestions. The Dutch invented Center Parcs, but holiday parks are often cheaper there than in the UK.This month, the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) issued a statement reassuring travellers that holidays won’t be affected by Brexit in 2020. Valid passports can still be used as normal, the cost of making calls, using the internet and sending texts will remain the same, and coaches and trains from the UK to the continent will be unaffected. Too adventurous? Switch off in comfort at the isolated Instants d’Absolu Ecolodge, a former farmhouse in the Auvergne, France, with a spa, delicious farm-to-table food and limited wifi and phone signal (Neussargues station is 10km away from £122 a night through i-escape). Or keep it simple – with a book by the (small) pool, wine in hand and views of the Umbrian hills at Wild Umbria, a holiday home for four (book through sawdays).Cycling specialist BSpoke Tours has a new coastal tour along the wild coast of northern Spain’s Asturias region (from £1,095pp, excluding travel take Brittany Ferries from Portsmouth to Santander). For sporty families, Adventure Creators puts together multi-activity trips in the French Pyrenees with rock climbing, high ropes and river rafting – ensuring kids will be so exhausted they may even forget about screens.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Dos Santos denies she became a billionaire through nepotism or corruption.The files were initially obtained by the anti-corruption charity Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).On Monday, PPLAAF identified the founder of Football Leaks as its source, saying in a statement: “The source of the Luanda Leaks is the whistleblower Rui Pinto.”“PPLAAF is pleased that once again a whistleblower is revealing to the world actions that go against international public interest,” said William Bourdon, the president of PPLAAF and also a lawyer for Pinto.Bourdon, a French human rights lawyer who has also acted for Edward Snowden, added: “Like in the case of the Football Leaks, these revelations should allow for new investigations to be launched and thus help in the fight against impunity for financial crimes in Angola and in the world.”The ICIJ’s director, Gerard Ryle, said: “The leaking of this material to PPLAAF, and in turn to ICIJ’s media partners, provided indisputable evidence of unnecessary misery that was inflicted on the ordinary people of Angola, and the role of enablers who got rich by helping. The documents came from a concerned citizen – someone doing the right thing by the public.”Since the publication last week of the Luanda Leaks, Dos Santos has been named as a criminal suspect in Angola, where prosecutors are investigating alleged embezzlement and mismanagement of funds during her leadership of the state oil giant Sonangol.Dos Santos denies accusations of nepotism and corruption. She has previously denounced Angolan criminal inquiries and media reports about her financial affairs as part of a politically motivated “witch-hunt” by the new Angolan president.“The allegations … are extremely misleading and untrue,” she said in her most recent statement. “This is a very concentrated, orchestrated and well-coordinated political attack, ahead of elections in Angola next year.”In its statement identifying Pinto as the source of the Luanda Leaks, PPLAAF said “the disclosure of the documents to PPLAAF was not politically motivated”.The Football Leaks website, launched in 2015, said its mission was to “show the hidden side of football”. The information it obtained and eventually shared with journalists around Europe raised concerns about the financial practices of some of the world’s biggest football clubs.Pinto, who was operating from Budapest, was detained in Hungary in January 2019 and extradited to Portugal in March. Earlier this month, a Portuguese judge ruled he would stand trial.Pinto faces 25 years in prison if found guilty of all 90 charges against him, his lawyer said. The charges include attempted extortion and hacking into the secret information at a number of organisations. He denies all wrongdoing and has never accepted the charges."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/518a82e36aad6ade72cc7f02b001623403fcbb1f/0_39_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9f5fe089be58787fa65d8157e200c83","title":"irish parties under pressure to consider sinn fein coalition","story":"Republicans’ polls surge tests centrists’ commitment to keeping them out of powerSinn Féin has surged in Ireland’s election campaign, putting pressure on centrist parties to drop their opposition to forming a coalition government with it after the election next month.Opinion polls show sharp rises in support for the republican party before an election on 8 February, potentially edging it closer to its goal of gaining power in Dublin to push for unification between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.Polls currently put the main opposition party, Fianna Fáil, on track to be the largest party in the Dáil with Leo Varadkar’s Fine Gael in second place, but suggest neither will be able to form a government without Sinn Féin’s support.Varadkar’s centre-right party, in power since 2011, has slumped amid voter fatigue. Youthful, gay and the son of an Indian immigrant, the taoiseach embodies a modernising Ireland and presides over a humming economy, but flaking public services and rows over homelessness and a proposed commemoration of pre-independence police forces have tarnished his image.Its name can be translated as family or tribe of the Irish.

Traces roots to Michael Collins and the winning side in Ireland’s 1922-23 civil war. The party traditionally advocates market economics and fiscal discipline. Appeals to the urban middle class and well-off farmers.Its name means Soldiers of Destiny. A centrist, ideologically malleable party that dominated Irish politics until it steered the Celtic Tiger economy over a cliff, prompting decade-long banishment to opposition benches. Under Micheál Martin, a nimble political veteran, it has clawed back support and may overtake Fine Gael as the biggest party and lead the next coalition government. Founded by Éamon de Valera, who backed the civil war’s losing side but turned Fianna Fáil into an election-winning machine.Its name means We Ourselves, signifying Irish sovereignty. A leftwing republican party that competes in Northern Ireland as well as the Republic. Traces roots to 1905. Emerged in current form during the Troubles, when it was linked to the IRA. Peace in Northern Ireland helped Sinn Féin rebrand as a working-class advocate opposed to austerity. Under Mary Lou McDonald, a Dubliner without paramilitary baggage, Sinn Féin is the third-biggest party. But Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil deem it too toxic for any coalition.Partnership with Fine Gael during post-Celtic Tiger austerity tainted the centre-left Labour party but it seems poised to return to government in coalition with Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. The political arm of the trade union movement, it is led by Brendan Howlin, a former teacher and government minister.The Social Democrats and Solidarity-People Before Profit are part of an alphabet soup of smaller, more leftwing parties. The Greens, wiped out in 2011 after a ruinous coalition with Fianna Fáil, hope to win a clutch of seats on the back of climate crisis anxiety and youth-led protests. Independent TDs have prospered in recent elections, turning some into outsized players in ruling coalitions. Rory CarrollSinn Féin, the political wing of the IRA during the Troubles, has meanwhile refashioned itself in the republic as a leftwing champion of the working-class and pensioners and an alternative to the Fianna FáilFine Gael conservative duopoly that has taken turns ruling Ireland for almost a century.Both the leading parties, along with the much smaller Labour, have ruled out any coalition with Sinn Féin, saying it remains beholden to shadowy IRA figures.Varadkar has floated a grand centrist alliance between his party and Fianna Fáil, which propped up Fine Gael’s outgoing administration with a confidence-and-supply deal, but Fianna Fáil’s leader, Micheál Martin, has ruled that out.The political establishment was “desperately” seeking justifications to exclude Sinn Féin, its leader, Mary Lou McDonald, told RTÉ radio. An effective media performer, she was expected to use a televised party leaders’ debate on Monday night to promote Sinn Féin as an agent of the change that most voters say they want.Sinn Féin’s return to government in Northern Ireland – the power-sharing executive at Stormont revived this month after a three-year impasse – is thought to have bolstered the party’s credibility south of the border.The retirement of former leader Gerry Adams – he is stepping down as a TD (MP) for Louth – will further distance the party from the Troubles.However, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael say a revelation about Sinn Féin leaders secretly consulting former IRA figures during Stormont’s “cash-for-ash” scandal shows why the party is not ready for power in Dublin. “We just don’t think that’s proper in a democratic society,” Varadkar said on Sunday.The taoiseach also cited Sinn Féin’s opposition to a special criminal court, which sits without juries and focuses on terrorism and organised crime. Another objection is Sinn Féin’s call for a referendum on Irish unity within five years, which Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael brand as reckless.Varadkar said, in hurling terms, that his party was three points behind, but predicted voters would return Fine Gael to power as the best manager of the economy and Brexit.In a combative BBC interview the taoiseach talked up Ireland’s ability to harness EU solidarity and to face down British policymakers, whom he accused of not understanding Ireland. Such rhetoric boosted his ratings last year but voters are now focused on housing shortages and dysfunctional hospitals."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4153330.1580165030!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 seven party leaders line out for tv debate","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom left to right: Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, Social Democrats joint leader Roisin Shortall, Fine Gael leader Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, host RTÉ\u0027s Claire Byrne, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, Fianna Fáil leader Micheal Martin, Solidarity People Before Profit politician Richard Boyd Barrett and Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin before the leaders debate in Galway on Monday.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire.Political leaders clashed on the issues that have dominated the general election campaign to date - housing, crime and living standards - during Monday night’s seven-way leaders’ debate on RTÉ. Potential post election government formation options were also briefly discussed with Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald attacking Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour on their pledges not to enter government with her party. The debate, moderated by broadcaster Claire Byrne, was held infront of a live audience in the National University of Ireland, Galway, where calls for a rent freeze and attacks on so-called vulture funds drew applause. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said his party in government would build social and affordable housing on State land and that “a commitment to building affordable housing just hasn’t been there” from the outgoing Fine Gael-led Government. However, he was attacked by Ms McDonald, who claimed Fianna Fáil had co-authored the housing crisis because of the confidence and supply agreement, which has seen it underpin the minority administration since 2016.The participants were Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Mr Martin, Ms McDonald, Labour leader Brendan Howlin, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, Richard Boyd Barrett of People Before Profit and Róisín Shortall of the Social Democrats.Mr Varadkar defended his party’s Help to Buy Scheme, which sees the State give first time buyers an income tax refund to help them get a mortgage deposit.“A number of people who are paying very high rent but could afford a mortgage if only they could get a deposit. I think it is a good economic policy and a good social policy to help people buy their own home. We have already doubled the supply of housing, and I can double it again,” he said. ChequeMr Ryan said the polices of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil - which is proposing a savings scheme for first time buyers - mean “you might as well give the cheque to the developer”. He called for cost rental housing to be delivered. Ms McDonald said “you can’t walk the length of yourself out on the campaign trail without hearing stories of real trauma” from people unable to buy a home or experiencing housing problems.“An incoming government needs to accept this is an emergency,” she added, calling for 100,000 public houses be built. She also called for a rent freeze, as did Mr Howlin who said between 80,000 and 100,000 social and affordable homes should be built. Mr Boyd Barrett was also applauded for attacking co-called vulture funds and banks.The debate followed the head to head between Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin on Virgin Media One last week. There will be another seven way debate on Virgin Media One on Thursday, moderated by Ivan Yates and Matt Cooper, with Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin squaring-off in a final debate on RTÉ One on Tuesday, February 4th, just days out from polling day on February 8th.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4153184.1580155189!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mcdonald and sf candidates sign pledge to be guided by ard chomhairle","story":"Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has signed a pledge, along with all of her party’s candidates, to be guided by instructions from its ruling body - despite insisting that she does not “take instruction from anyone”.The pledge, which Sinn Féin requires all candidates to sign, promises that “in all matters pertaining to the duties and functions of an elected representative, I will be guided by and hold myself amenable to all directions and instructions issued to me by An Ard Chomhairle of Sinn Féin”.Other parties have accused Sinn Féin of being guided by unelected party and former IRA figures, with both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil citing it as a reason to rule out any possible coalition deal with the party.Ms McDonald told RTÉ on Sunday: “I can assure you that I don’t take instruction from anyone. I do of course, as any sensible person, always seek out good advice and good counsel, but that’s a world away from suggesting you’re under the influence of another person.”‘No different’A Sinn Féin spokesman said the party’s ard chomhairle is “no different to the governing body of any other political party, trade union or sporting organisation”.“Sinn Féin’s Ard Fheis - which is representative of our entire membership - decides our policy platform. Our policies are published for all to see, and our public representatives - elected by the people - stand for election on the basis of those policies. This pledge commits our representatives to deliver on the policies we present to the electorate, and the role of the Ard Chomhairle is to ensure that our representatives honour that commitment,” the party said in a statement.The party supplied a list of all members of the ard chomhairle.Sinn Féin opponents have seized on the evidence from the cash-for-ash inquiry to accuse the party of still being under the influence of former IRA figures. Ms McDonald has consistently rejected the accusation that she is not in full control of the party. She said at the weekend that the “political establishment” is “desperately reaching for any excuse to exclude Sinn Féin” from government.She has disputed suggestions that Mr Ó Muilleoir was seeking permission from senior party and former IRA figures to agree to changes suggested by his officials in the controversial renewable heat incentive scheme.Approval soughtTexts and emails in late January 2017 show that Mr Ó Muilleoir sought approval from senior republican Ted Howell, who was an IRA go-between in the 1990s and one of Gerry Adams’ closest advisers.Mr Ó Muilleoir had been asked to approve a plan to slash the costs of a scheme that by then had been closed to new entrants for almost a year, but officials fretted that he was taking too long.Fearing that efforts to bring RHI under control would fail, David Sterling, then the civil service head in finance and now Northern Ireland’s most senior official, told a fellow mandarin by text that he feared Mr Ó Muilleoir was “acting under instruction”.Despite being urged by officials to accept the curbs, Mr Ó Muilleoir also consulted with Padraic Wilson and Martin Lynch, both long-standing Republicans who are widely believed to have been senior members of the IRA.Mr O Muilleoir rejected the suggestion that he was asking the men for permission. Ms McDonald said he was simply consulting with the party.

It creates a situation where your mind knows what’s best but your heart rules.’ Photograph courtesy Michael McGrealThe Irish Embassy in China is exploring options to evacuate the Irish nationals under lockdown in Wuhan due to the coronavirus, but the offer poses a dilemma for those in the stricken city as their Chinese partners would be left behind and anyone leaving would face another period under quarantine once they got out of the affected area.Michael McGreal, from Westport, Co Mayo, who is one of the at least six Irish nationals known to be in the affected Hubei province, was informed by the Irish Embassy in Beijing on Monday night that it was looking for ways to fly the Irish out of the area.“We are currently exploring a number of commercial flight options with other countries to potentially allow travel from Wuhan during the current lockdown. To help our planning in this, we would appreciate if you could let us know whether you would be interested in availing of a seat on such a flight, if it is possible to arrange,” a note from the embassy said.The note added that: “As you know, travel to and from Wuhan is controlled by the Chinese authorities, and we are exploring this possibility with them and will continue communications with them to see what options exist as the situation unfolds.”‘Quarantine controls’The Irish in the area, who have been under lockdown in their homes since Thursday, were also told that they would likely have to go through a period of quarantine once they were flown out of the country.“You should also be aware that there is a likelihood that any travel from Wuhan would be followed by a period in quarantine controls,” the embassy note said.Mr McGreal, who has been in Wuhan for 12 years and is married to a Chinese national, said he was very grateful the embassy was making efforts to give people the option to leave, but he felt obliged to stay as the Chinese government would not let his wife fly out too under the current travel restrictions.“I won’t take it. My wife can’t board,” he said, “I’m annoyed about this. It creates a situation where your mind knows what’s best but your heart rules.”The small group of Irish left in the city have formed a WeChat social media group – known as “The Wuhan Six” – to compare notes and discuss options, he said.The majority of the group have Chinese spouses or partners, Mr McGreal said. “Mostly everyone wants to stick it out with their girlfriend or wife,” he said, adding that he felt perhaps only one member of the group, who was single, had suggested he might avail of the evacuation offer.Another issue was leaving a city where they had been cooped up for days, only to fly to another quarantine situation at home.“A lot of us don’t want to go home now to spend 14 days in isolation,” he said. “We already have that done, we don’t want to do another 14 days.”Dire shortageThere has been a dire shortage of surgical masks across China, but particularly in Hubei, since the coronavirus struck and took the lives of at least 61 and infected nearly 3,000.On Monday, the Irish Embassy made arrangements to ship masks to the Irish in the province, which came as a big relief, Mr McGreal said. “Now, the embassy is dispensing masks to the Irish in Wuhan who badly need it . . . That’s a huge help,” he said.Even though it seemed most were not going to avail of the evacuation offer, the Irish group in Wuhan was very pleased that an option was in the pipeline, he said.As of late Monday night, the estimated 300 British in the province had not received any notification from their government about evacuation, he said, and “the Brits in Wuhan are absolutely losing their heads”.Mr McGreal posted the Irish Embassy note in a British social media group, and they “are going crazy . . . They can’t believe no offer has been made to them,” he said.“Compared to the actions of the British government in regards to getting an evacuation for their citizens, this makes me proud to be Irish,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Not so smart after all: How the \u0026#39smart motorway\u0026#39 roll-out has cost lives Comment: The reality is that there is a war going on at present, it\u0026#39s being fought out in cyberspaceLow skilled migrants to be restricted to time-limited job offers in shortage areas under new points systemSelf-harming by boys increases by 50 per cent in just four years, prompting warnings over role of social mediaBoris Johnson to defy warnings from Trump and own MPs to announce Huawei will build part of 5G networkComment: Here’s what it will mean to be a truly global Britain post-BrexitSmart motorways scandal: Highways Agency facing police probe over deaths of stranded driversPrince Andrew has not responded to FBI requests for interview over Epstein, prosecutor saysGary Lineker calls for BBC licence fee to be made voluntary as he brands it the broadcaster\u0026#39s \u0026#39fundamental problem\u0026#39 Home schooling drops for first time in four years, following crackdown on \u0026#39off-rolling\u0026#39Former Belgian king admits he fathered lovechild LA police grounded helicopters because of dangerous fog before Kobe Bryant crash Abuse victims to be given second phones to boost conviction rates\u0026#39The magnitude of the crime is terrifying\u0026#39: Tributes and tears as Holocaust survivors gather at Auschwitz\u0026#39s \u0026#39gates of death\u0026#39Man tried to steal Magna Carta from Salisbury Cathedral because he thought it was fake, court hearsDistinctive wines of Burgundy and Bordeaux could be lost forever, as climate change forces grape changeMimi Haley tells jury in Harvey Weinstein trial she felt \u0026#39like an idiot\u0026#39 after being raped by the producer Emily Thornberry praises Jeremy Corbyn for calling out racism at Holocaust Memorial Day event \u0026#39Naive\u0026#39 vicar faced disciplinary after parishioner who faked terminal illness accused him of impregnating her, tribunal hearsProstate cancer now the most commonly diagnosed form thanks to \u0026#39Turnbull and Fry\u0026#39 effectThe little known Holocaust memorial built by German schoolchildren that inspired a civil rights activistWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/26/TELEMMGLPICT000222570303_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-pfgFGBz9L_4V5dRQnfCxd6yN5CV7Pul_xM_LGnPwu0.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"thirsty martyrdom living wage thousands afghans signed irans","story":"Smoke billows after an air strike by pro-regime forces on the city of Maaret al-Numan, Idlib, on January 25As a newly-married but penniless student in the Afghan city of Herat, Mehdi recalls he had little idea how he was going to support his new family.Pondering his meagre finances and surveying Afghanistan\u0027s bleak jobs market, he was at a loss until a friend made an unexpected offer.The friend, who Mehdi declined to name, had recently returned from fighting with an Iranian-backed militia in Syria, called the Fatemiyoun.The wages were good and fighters were rewarded with prized Iranian residency papers.Desperate for money, Mehdi, a Shia Muslim from Afghanistan\u0027s Hazara ethnic minority who declined to give his full name, became one of what are estimated to be up to 50,000 Afghan volunteers of the Fatemiyoun brigade who have fought in the Syrian war since 2013.The pro-Assad force organised by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has been pitched into some of the most intense fighting of the conflict, as part of Tehran\u0027s campaign to help the Syrian regime recapture territory from opposition factions.Battlefield communications obtained by the  suggest Afghan militiamen and their Iranian commanders are now fighting in Syria’s final rebel stronghold.“I was in desperately in need of money to handle my life,” Mehdi, now 26, recalled of his decision. “Here, I had a friend who was a fighter and when he saw me in need of money and told me about a profitable job.”A market place in Idlib after it was hit by Syrian and Russian airstrikes in January. Afghan militias are believed to be involved in the battle on the Syrian government side. Smuggling himself across the border, he travelled to a suburb south of Tehran and signed up at a mosque. Most of the Fatemiyoun\u0027s volunteers were from Iran\u0027s large community of Afghan migrant workers and refugees, researchers and officials said.A far smaller number are recruited directly from Afghanistan, sometimes encouraged by pro-Iran clerics.Economic hardship has been recruits\u0027 main motivation, according to a recent report by the United States Institute of Peace which interviewed fighters and their families, while some also sought adventure, or were driven by religious sentiment.Mehdi\u0027s wages began as soon as he joined up, he recalls, but so did indoctrination as instructors tried to whip up the recruits\u0027 religious feeling. Veterans say instructors stressed that Shia holy shrines were in danger from Syrian rebels and the Fatemiyoun had a duty to defend them.Pro-government fighters in Al-Bab, Aleppo province, in November 2016“From that day I was receiving my salary. And they started to work on our mind,” he said. “Both Afghans and Iranians were training us. Afghans were telling us something about war and working with weapons, but Iranians were working on our minds. We had so many religious programs that we were thirsty for martyrdom. We were counting down to go to Syria and die,“ he said.“They were telling us that our beliefs are the only thing we have and we should defend them.”Training was often cursory. If commanders were short of troops at the front, recruits sometimes only had 10 days of training, recalled another veteran who gave his name as Ali Reza.If the situation was better, it could be twice as long.“Some were asking why Iran\u0027s military does not intervene directly, and Iranians were saying that they don’t intervene directly through their military because US forces are there and could create more pressure between the two countries,” Ali Reza said.The Afghan militias were thrown into the battle for Aleppo alongside regular Syrian forces, seen here during fighting in the city in 2016Both men were pitched into the battle for Aleppo. The Fatemiyoun were directed by Iranian commanders and employed to breach defences, or clear the way ahead of Syrian forces.Casualty rates were often appalling. “In one of my most intense fights, our group had nearly 50 members but when we reached the rear base, only three or four were unhurt,“ he said. ”Two of my friends were killed there, one had a fiancé. I saw the deaths of my many friends by my own eyes in Syrian front lines.”Mehdi said he had served three tours of six months each, before deciding he had enough. “First, I got enough money and now I don’t need as much,” he said.He also felt the shrines he had vowed to defend were no longer in danger. Many of the Afghans who fought at the peak of the war have demobilised, staying in Iran to take advantage of their new legal status, or returning across the border to family.Those returning to Afghanistan are often viewed with suspicion by the authorities, who doubt their loyalties.Shia religious and political leaders in Afghanistan have almost all opposed sending Afghans to join the Fatemiyoun.Yet if the call to defend the holy shrines again, Mehdi said he would return. “If I feel they are again close to destroying shrines, I will not hesitate and will go back.”Not so smart after all: How the \u0026#39smart motorway\u0026#39 roll-out has cost lives Comment: The reality is that there is a war going on at present, it\u0026#39s being fought out in cyberspaceLow skilled migrants to be restricted to time-limited job offers in shortage areas under new points systemSelf-harming by boys increases by 50 per cent in just four years, prompting warnings over role of social mediaBoris Johnson to defy warnings from Trump and own MPs to announce Huawei will build part of 5G networkComment: Here’s what it will mean to be a truly global Britain post-BrexitSmart motorways scandal: Highways Agency facing police probe over deaths of stranded driversPrince Andrew has not responded to FBI requests for interview over Epstein, prosecutor saysGary Lineker calls for BBC licence fee to be made voluntary as he brands it the broadcaster\u0026#39s \u0026#39fundamental problem\u0026#39 Home schooling drops for first time in four years, following crackdown on \u0026#39off-rolling\u0026#39Former Belgian king admits he fathered lovechild LA police grounded helicopters because of dangerous fog before Kobe Bryant crash Abuse victims to be given second phones to boost conviction rates\u0026#39The magnitude of the crime is terrifying\u0026#39: Tributes and tears as Holocaust survivors gather at Auschwitz\u0026#39s \u0026#39gates of death\u0026#39Man tried to steal Magna Carta from Salisbury Cathedral because he thought it was fake, court hearsDistinctive wines of Burgundy and Bordeaux could be lost forever, as climate change forces grape changeMimi Haley tells jury in Harvey Weinstein trial she felt \u0026#39like an idiot\u0026#39 after being raped by the producer Emily Thornberry praises Jeremy Corbyn for calling out racism at Holocaust Memorial Day event \u0026#39Naive\u0026#39 vicar faced disciplinary after parishioner who faked terminal illness accused him of impregnating her, tribunal hearsProstate cancer now the most commonly diagnosed form thanks to \u0026#39Turnbull and Fry\u0026#39 effectThe little known Holocaust memorial built by German schoolchildren that inspired a civil rights activistWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/25/TELEMMGLPICT000222442328_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"author calls brexit coin boycott lack oxford comma","story":"The Chancellor unveils the first images of the Brexit coin, a 50p bearing the inscription ‘Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations’ For a time, it seemed nothing could ide the nation more sharply than Brexit. Today, even that most seismic of issues faced being dwarfed by a new controversy featuring a coin, a quotation, and a comma. A new 50p coin commemorating Brexit caused a very British conundrum, as fans and critics vied over the absence of the Oxford comma from its phrase “Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations”.Sir Philip Pullman, the award-winning author, led the charge, calling for all literate people to boycott the coins. Some claimed the omission of a second comma was “killing” them, while others declared Pullman plainly wrong.The coin, which had already been condemned by fervent remain supporters for appearing to celebrate Britain’s exit from the EU, will enter circulation on Friday, and bears the date 31 January 2020.After its image was revealed this weekend, remainers said they would refuse to accept the coin from shopkeepers arguing it would “rub our noses” in the referendum defeat.  The quotation is inspired by Thomas Jefferson\u0026#39s principles of government, including  “peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations\u0026#34By Monday, an even more isive debate had emerged.Sir Philip, author of the His Dark Materials series, said on Twitter: “The \u0027Brexit\u0027 50p coin is missing an Oxford comma, and should be boycotted by all literate people.”Told the comma was “surely optional”, he said: “Only if you think your readers don\u0027t deserve clarity.”“It makes me even more annoyed,” he added.Stig Abell, the editor of the Times Literary Supplement, also lamented the coin\u0027s punctuation, saying: Not perhaps the only objection, but the lack of a comma after \u0027prosperity\u0027 is killing me.Others claimed the Oxford comma, also known as the “serial comma”, is an Americanism and not required in the short sentence on the face of a 50p piece.Asked for his expert opinion on the matter, Professor David Crystal, linguist and author of more than 100 books on the English language, said there has been “ided usage on this issue for over a century”.Sir Philip Pullman, the author“In the case of the Brexit coin, there is no issue of meaning,” he said. “It is a matter of perceptions of elegance.“For some, the presence of the comma preserves a neat parallelism between the three nouns. For others, the extra comma adds unnecessary clutter.“It is, as almost all punctuation commentators have concluded, ultimately a matter of taste.”Harry Mount, author of Amo, Amas, Amat and All That, said: “Philip Pullman is wrong.“The Oxford comma is a convention you can choose to follow or choose not to follow. The important thing is to be consistent and stick with whichever convention you choose.“If you don\u0027t use the Oxford comma, there are rare occasions when you might use it to avoid confusion.“But this instance – \u0027Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations\u0027 - is not one of those exceptions. It is completely correct.”A spokesman for the Royal Mint said all UK coin designs go through a “rigorous planning and design selection process governed by an independent panel”.“The wording on the coin was inspired by a quotation from Thomas Jefferson, which has been adapted by others on several occasions since,” she said.“We completely respect the views of those who have suggested that there should be an additional comma within the inscription but in this instance the judgement has been taken that the message on the coin is appropriately conveyed in its current form.”According to the Treasury, around three million Brexit coins will be issued on Friday, with a further seven million due to enter circulation in 2020.Frances Coppola, who writes on finance and economics, said the punctuation was not essential for the new 50p.Responding to Sir Philip, she tweeted: As all literate people know, the Oxford comma is entirely optional.But it offends both in its presence and its absence.Whatever the choice, someone will think it wrong. There could not be a better commemoration of Brexit.What is the Oxford comma?Also known as a serial comma, the Oxford comma derives its common name from its use in by the Oxford University Press (OUP).The OUP\u0027s style guide states: In a list of three or more items, insert a comma before the \u0027and\u0027 or \u0027or\u0027. It lists the example: “Red, white, and blue.”The University of Oxford style guide takes a more nuanced view, saying there is “no comma between the penultimate item in a list and ‘and’‘or’, unless required to prevent ambiguity”.“However, always insert a comma in this position if it would help prevent confusion,” it adds, using the example: “She left her money to her parents, Mother Theresa and the pope”.The University of Cambridge agrees. Its style guide states: “An Oxford comma is one used before an \u0027and\u0027 at the end of a list and is used to avoid ambiguity.”Not so smart after all: How the \u0026#39smart motorway\u0026#39 roll-out has cost lives Comment: The reality is that there is a war going on at present, it\u0026#39s being fought out in cyberspaceLow skilled migrants to be restricted to time-limited job offers in shortage areas under new points systemBoris Johnson to defy warnings from Trump and own MPs to announce Huawei will build part of 5G networkSelf-harming by boys increases by 50 per cent in just four years, prompting warnings over role of social mediaComment: Here’s what it will mean to be a truly global Britain post-BrexitSmart motorways scandal: Highways Agency facing police probe over deaths of stranded driversPrince Andrew has not responded to FBI requests for interview over Epstein, prosecutor saysGary Lineker calls for BBC licence fee to be made voluntary as he brands it the broadcaster\u0026#39s \u0026#39fundamental problem\u0026#39 Home schooling drops for first time in four years, following crackdown on \u0026#39off-rolling\u0026#39Former Belgian king admits he fathered lovechild LA police grounded helicopters because of dangerous fog before Kobe Bryant crash Abuse victims to be given second phones to boost conviction rates\u0026#39The magnitude of the crime is terrifying\u0026#39: Tributes and tears as Holocaust survivors gather at Auschwitz\u0026#39s \u0026#39gates of death\u0026#39Man tried to steal Magna Carta from Salisbury Cathedral because he thought it was fake, court hearsDistinctive wines of Burgundy and Bordeaux could be lost forever, as climate change forces grape changeMimi Haley tells jury in Harvey Weinstein trial she felt \u0026#39like an idiot\u0026#39 after being raped by the producer Emily Thornberry praises Jeremy Corbyn for calling out racism at Holocaust Memorial Day event \u0026#39Naive\u0026#39 vicar faced disciplinary after parishioner who faked terminal illness accused him of impregnating her, tribunal hearsProstate cancer now the most commonly diagnosed form thanks to \u0026#39Turnbull and Fry\u0026#39 effectThe little known Holocaust memorial built by German schoolchildren that inspired a civil rights activistWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/royal-family/2020/01/27/TELEMMGLPICT000110903810_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO6QpIblidqHYceykOFBymEDlT6p8TPuWfOauUen7XeM.jpeg?imw","title":"duchess cambridge shows wield influence subtly","story":"The Duchess has cited Vermeer\u0026#39s paintings as a key influence in her recent series of portraits of Holocaust survivorsThree cheers for the Duchess of Cambridge, who, after a tumultuous month for the Royal Family, has delivered a poignant tribute to Britain’s Jewish community as they mark 75 years since the end of the Holocaust. Lending your voice as a royal to causes with a political edge is a tactic that can all too easily backfire – as the Sussexes discovered to their peril last year. Yet the Duchess of Cambridge, in her series of moving photographs of Holocaust survivors, walks this tightrope with perfect ease, drawing attention to the lessons of history whilst preserving political neutrality. In one fell swoop, she has shown us that the Royal Family is in safe hands.After an election campaign that was riddled with talk of anti Semitism and reports of yet another hate crime shortly after Christmas where a Hampstead synagogue was daubed in anti-Semitic graffiti, the Cambridges could have been forgiven for deeming this issue too politically sensitive to address. As the Duchess prepared to publish these photographs, she must have had one eye on the negative press garnered by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for speaking up on topical issues like climate change and feminism. But this makes her support of such a significant anniversary all the more brave and pertinent. Many in the press have remarked on the double standards to which the two Duchesses are held. Supporters of the Duchess of Sussex have pointed out that the Cambridges have unfairly avoided many of the criticisms that have been levelled at Meghan and Harry. But it’s worth considering why it is that, in this instance, Kate has managed to wield her influence with such subtlety and good sense - because it’s a model other royals would do well to follow going forward.The answer lies in her canny use of art. The focus of her photographs is on the human stories that lie behind the Holocaust and the imagery within them unravels slowly the more you study them: the inclusion of personal items such as a pan used in a concentration camp and a tomato grown in a survivors’ garden puts the focus squarely on the survivors’ experience and its relevance to the present. Yvonne Bernstein, originally from Germany, who was a hidden child in France throughout most of the Holocaust, pictured with her granddaughter Chloe Wright, aged 11The Duchess has cited Vermeer’s paintings as a key influence and it’s not hard to see why: like Vermeer, her images make a feature of the natural light which, symbolically, comes from windows which are positioned to the east to evoke Jerusalem. Kate’s careful use of symbolism demonstrates how she has chosen to show rather than tell. As she reveals her artistic side to the nation, she would surely approve of Anton Chekhov’s sentiment: ‘Don’t tell me the moon is shining, show me the glint of light on broken glass.\u0027Her example paints a clear picture of how the royals can operate in future – lending support to the issues that count in a manner that, rather than seeking to be pejorative, opens up an opportunity for national reflection and discussion. The events of January have laid bare the frustrations that come with royal life. There must be times when the desire to have your say on a subject is overwhelming, especially when life as a working royal brings you into such close contact with some of the most pressing issues facing modern Britain.But Kate has demonstrated that royalty does not confine you to a life of silence. In fact, the restrictions in which she has to operate have led her to create a much more restrained and self-effacing statement than any politician attempting to denounce the rise of anti-Semitism has managed.There’s a rich history of artists in the royal family – from Prince Charles to Queen Victoria and her daughter, the Duchess of Argyll. But the Duchess of Cambridge’s new photography is a bold departure from the safe watercolour landscapes of previous generations. Let’s hope this isn’t the last we see of Kate the artist.  Duchess of SussexDuchess of CambridgeDuke of SussexNot so smart after all: How the \u0026#39smart motorway\u0026#39 roll-out has cost lives Comment: The reality is that there is a war going on at present, it\u0026#39s being fought out in cyberspaceLow skilled migrants to be restricted to time-limited job offers in shortage areas under new points systemSelf-harming by boys increases by 50 per cent in just four years, prompting warnings over role of social mediaBoris Johnson to defy warnings from Trump and own MPs to announce Huawei will build part of 5G networkComment: Here’s what it will mean to be a truly global Britain post-BrexitSmart motorways scandal: Highways Agency facing police probe over deaths of stranded driversPrince Andrew has not responded to FBI requests for interview over Epstein, prosecutor saysGary Lineker calls for BBC licence fee to be made voluntary as he brands it the broadcaster\u0026#39s \u0026#39fundamental problem\u0026#39 Home schooling drops for first time in four years, following crackdown on \u0026#39off-rolling\u0026#39Former Belgian king admits he fathered lovechild LA police grounded helicopters because of dangerous fog before Kobe Bryant crash Abuse victims to be given second phones to boost conviction rates\u0026#39The magnitude of the crime is terrifying\u0026#39: Tributes and tears as Holocaust survivors gather at Auschwitz\u0026#39s \u0026#39gates of death\u0026#39Man tried to steal Magna Carta from Salisbury Cathedral because he thought it was fake, court hearsDistinctive wines of Burgundy and Bordeaux could be lost forever, as climate change forces grape changeMimi Haley tells jury in Harvey Weinstein trial she felt \u0026#39like an idiot\u0026#39 after being raped by the producer Emily Thornberry praises Jeremy Corbyn for calling out racism at Holocaust Memorial Day event \u0026#39Naive\u0026#39 vicar faced disciplinary after parishioner who faked terminal illness accused him of impregnating her, tribunal hearsProstate cancer now the most commonly diagnosed form thanks to \u0026#39Turnbull and Fry\u0026#39 effectThe little known Holocaust memorial built by German schoolchildren that inspired a civil rights activistWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/27/TELEMMGLPICT000222841945_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqxqudurc5yeFP8agH1DpUvrhBYMiTdMy6qmzC8lbSq4M.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"ex belgian king admits fathered lovechild years speculation","story":"King Albert II, seen here with Queen Paola, said the process had not respected the private lives of all involvedAlbert II, the 85-year-old former King of Belgium, has admitted that he is the biological father of Delphine Boel, a 51-year-old artist, after years of speculation.The former monarch confirmed he was Ms Boel’s father following publication of the results of a DNA test he took in December. The former king, who abdicated in 2013, said in a statement that he wanted to “put an end to this painful procedure with honour and dignity”.Ms Boel first publicly claimed that the former king was her father in 2013. When he abdicated that year, passing the throne to his son, the current king, Philippe, he lost legal immunity and Ms Boel relaunched proceedings against him to prove he was her father. Her mother is Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, a Belgian aristocrat married to a wealthy industrialist.  Ms Boel and her mother moved to England when she was nine. Ms Boël went to boarding schools in England and Switzerland, and studied at the Chelsea School of Art and Design in London, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts. Albert made his first public comment that was later taken as confirmation that he was Ms Boel’s father in a Christmas speech to the nation in 1999.Delphine Boel is now legally entitled to call herself a princessHe said: “This Christmas feast is also the occasion for each of us to think to one\u0027s own family, to one\u0027s happy periods but also to one\u0027s difficult moments. The Queen and I have remembered very happy periods but also the crisis that our couple has experienced more than 30 years ago. “Together we could, (a) very long time ago already, surpass those difficulties and find back a deep understanding and love,” he said.  “We don\u0027t wish to dwell on that subject which belongs to our private lives,” he said on Belgian television. The former monarch said in a statement accepting the DNA test results that the process had not respected “the private lives” of those involved. He said there were “legal arguments” why being the biological father did not mean he was the “legal father”. Now that Albert has officially admitted that Ms Boel is his daughter, she is legally entitled to call herself a royal princess and to a share of his estate when he dies.  Belgium’s Supreme Court said in December that Albert should undergo DNA tests to establish whether he was Ms Boel’s biological father.The former monarch had appealed against previous court decisions ordering him to undergo the paternity test.Not so smart after all: How the \u0026#39smart motorway\u0026#39 roll-out has cost lives Comment: The reality is that there is a war going on at

office preparing extract british nationals wuhan amid","story":"Wuhan has been placed on lockdown by Chinese authorities in a bid to contain the virusDepartment for Health \u0026amp Social CareBritain will put people airlifted from China into quarantine amid concerns that around 1,500 people who arrived in the UK since the new year have not undergone checks.The Health Secretary today ordered a “belt and braces” approach to coronavirus amid concerns that the virus is far more contagious than was thought. Scientists in China believe that it could be transmitted for up to two weeks before the carrier has any symptoms, such as a fever or cough. Under the new plans, all 1,500 people who have flown in from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, since mid-January will be asked to remain in isolation for at least a fortnight. Health officials are now desperately attempting to track such cases, to make sure they stay in their homes, and limit any spread of the disease. But it is understood that they only have contact details for one in 10 cases who arrived on such flights. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has embarked on a desperate scramble to return another 200 British nationals stranded in Wuhan. All such arrivals will be be instructed to enter two weeks of isolation, under the new plans. If they are unable to do this at home, facilities will be set up to ensure they can be safely quarantined. The change in strategy follows warnings from Chinese authorities that the virus could be transmitted for up to two weeks before any symptoms are visible. The Chinese city of Wuhan has been on lockdown since last Wednesday, after the rapid spread of a virus which was first reported to the World Health Organisation almost a month ago. Yesterday Public Health England said they expect to see cases in Britain, wiht the first case is likely to come from somebody who is already here. The agency is already under fire for its efforts to prevent the spread of the virus.Last week passengers returning to Heathrow from Wuhan and its surrounding areas said they were simply given leaflets advising them which symptoms to look out for. Ministers have now instructed health officials to take a more robust approach. All passengers that have been on such flights in recent weeks will be urge them to “self-isolate” themselves for at least two weeks after departing China. British scientists believe around 100,000 people across the globe are likely to be infected by the virus. Only around 2,900 cases have been confirmed - mostly in the city of Wuhan - including around 80 deaths. Mr Hancock told the Commons: “This is a new disease and the global scientific community is still learning about it. I have directed Public Health England to take a belt and braces approach, including tracing people who have been in Wuhan in the past 14 days.“Coronaviruses do not usually spread if people don’t have symptoms – however, we cannot be 100 percent certain. From today, as concerns have been raised about limited pre-symptom transmission we are therefore asking anyone in the UK who has returned from Wuhan City in the last 14 Days to self-isolate - to stay indoors and avoid contact with other people – and to contact NHS 111.”The new advice says anyone who develops symptoms in the UK should call their GP or ring 111. They are being warned not to leave their homes unless they have been given medical advice. Public Health England officials are continuing to trace people who have arrived in the UK from Hubei Province. “Having eliminated those who we know have since left the country, there are 1,460 people we are seeking to locate,” he told the Commons. Prof Yvonne Doyle, PHE medical director, yesterday, said Our view is that, although airports are important, the most likely place that we might find a case is somebody in the country already, and it\u0027s absolutely critical that the public health service and the NHS are ready to diagnose that and are able to designate the person to the right facilities. That\u0027s the most likely scenario we are dealing with.The Foreign Office is drafting plans to extract British nationals stranded by the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan. Ministers are working to get Britons out of Hubei province, which has effectively been shut down by Chinese authorities in a bid to contain the virus.In an updated statement, the Foreign Office on Monday said anyone in the province who needs assistance can call a 24-hour helpline.A spokesman said: We are working to make an option available for British nationals to leave Hubei province due to the heavy travel restrictions and increased difficulty of accessing consular or medical assistance.The safety and security of British nationals is our number one priority.We continue to monitor developments closely and are in close touch with the Chinese authorities.Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s official spokesman said: The Foreign Office are in close contact with international partners, including the US and European countries, to investigate possible solutions.The Foreign Office recently updated its guidance to advise against all travel to Hubei province, which has been on lockdown for several days.But the guidance also added: If you are in this area and able to leave, you should do so. This is due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak.Other countries including France, the United States and Japan have already mobilised plans to remove their citizens from Wuhan. The Spanish government also said on Monday it was planning to repatriate its citizens.The announcement came after Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary, suggested UK citizens could be airlifted from China. Asked if he supported flying Britons back from Wuhan and elsewhere, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme on Monday: I think I would be very sympathetic and I\u0027m sure the Foreign Office would be too.Mr Hunt said the NHS was well-equipped to deal with patients returning with the virus but warned that it could strain the service.This is a very difficult time of year for the NHS - it is the most difficult time. But, again, my experience is that the NHS does know how to cope with these kinds of emergencies. I think the thing that will be difficult is the knock-on impact on other NHS services, he said.I think it would be very, very challenging for the NHS in terms of the regular workload but I have absolutely no doubt that, when it comes to doing what comes to necessary to isolate the virus and keep the public safe, our doctors and nurses will do exactly what they need to do.Earlier on Monday, the medical director of Public Health England, Yvonne Doyle, said she would be surprised if coronavirus cases were not soon confirmed in Britain. As of Sunday, 52 people across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have been tested for the deadly flu-like virus but all have returned negative. On Monday, health officials said 73 had been tested but none were positive.Prof  Doyle told the Today programme: The important thing here is to be aware of the case definition of what constitutes a risk to the person and to the population. A performer wears a face mask during Chinese New Year celebrations in LondonSo if somebody is unwell..if they have a cough, if they have fever, difficulty breathing and of course if they have been connected to Wuhan those are the four criteria.Otherwise we have a lot of people who are just very worried but well.Prof Doyle said efforts were continuing to trace the 2,000 people who have entered the UK from China on international flights.Coronavirus everything you need to know puffWe are now looking back to see whether any of them are still in the country, because some of them will have returned to China, but there are moves to identify them, she said.It\u0027s not always possible to find everybody but we are working to our best endeavours.England\u0027s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty also said there was a fair chance cases would emerge in Britain as the overall number reported around the world climbed to about 2,744 including 80 deaths, which have all occurred in China.The current risk to the public remains low, the health department said, adding that the Government is continuing to monitor the situation closely.Britons inside Wuhan have told of struggles to make contact with UK authorities. A pair of British teachers who have been working in Wuhan say they have not left their apartment for five days, that all transport has been stopped and there is no place to go and so we are pretty much stuck.Jason Neal and Sophie Hunt told BBC Breakfast said there had been no reassurance from the British authorities whom they have struggled to contact, possibly because of the time difference and them being closed over the weekend.People argue with riot police inside the lobby of a residential building in Hong Kong in protest against plans for an empty local housing estate to become a temporary quarantine campThey have about five days of food left and are keeping in touch with colleagues online while the scene outside is now like a ghost town.Mr Neal said: Even if the news is just to sit tight and nothing is going to change - I think it is just the silence that is disconcerting.We have not heard anything from outside of Wuhan for a week now.Mathematics teacher David Marland, 34, told the  how he knew he had to call a doctor when he stepped off a plane at Gatwick Airport last week.For the past decade Mr Marland has lived and worked in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of a dangerous epidemic that shows few signs of slowing down.David Marland has lived and worked in Wuhan but returned to Britain last weekWhat’s more, Mr Marland lives only five minutes from the seafood market suspected to be the source of the virus, and walks through it nearly every day. Indeed a coronavirus case was recently confirmed in his apartment block.But when he called the NHS 111 helpline, as suspected carriers have been advised to do, the answer was unexpected.Instead of being called in immediately for a test, he says he was asked only if he had “the sniffles”. When he replied in the negative, the specialist on the other end of the line told him to call back if he started feeling unwell. With that, the conversation was over.On Sunday, Mr Marland, 34, learned that the advice given to him may simply have been wrong. In a surprise announcement, Chinese officials suggested that carriers of coronavirus can actually spread the disease for up to two weeks without displaying any symptoms. If the Chinese are right, Mr Marland fears he and other potential carriers might be unwittingly carrying the deadly virus, and potentially spreading it to the public. Even his own relatives have asked him to stay away for fear of contracting the disease themselves.“I’m potentially a risk to other people,” he told the .“I’m still within the two week period so I could be spreading the disease everywhere without having any symptoms.”Numerous countries across the globe, including the UK, have introduced screening at airports in an attempt to identify people who may have coronavirus symptoms. But the limit here is that only those who are already ill will be picked up. So health experts say the most effective way to control the spread of viruses is an alert health system and high standards of infection control.A medic takes the temperature of a man at the Wuhan Red Cross Hospital in WuhanProf David Heymann, infectious disease expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that perhaps the most valuable element of airport screening is telling passengers about the signs and symptoms of a disease and what they should do if they’re worried.“Educating the public is key,” he told The .People wearing face masks have become a defining image of large disease outbreaks, and this one is no different, with cities in Asia already reporting shortages as masks fly off the shelves. But in reality, the thin material masks do little to stop a respiratory virus spreading. “The face masks that we see people wearing are surgical face masks,” said Dr Mark Parrish, regional medical director of the medical and travel security firm International SOS. “As you breathe in and out you\u0027re breathing air from outside the face mask. So it will stop a little bit but not hugely.”Chinese New Year revellers in London wore face masks to the celebrations amid the coronavirus fearsJonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, added that face masks were proven to be effective in hospitals.“There are reports in literature that face masks in a hospital setting can protect health care workers. But there, they are being used for short periods by trained professions,changed frequently and properly disposed of. Those staff are also adopting good personal hygiene. “But in the general population it may even be the case that they’re not helpful at all,” he added.“If you don’t change them regularly enough, they could potentially start to trap viruses and eventually they can move through that mask into your respiratory tract.”  Dr Parrish added that heavy duty masks, called N95\u0027s, are far more effective than simple surgical masks for the general population. But these aren\u0027t fool-proof either. “These cause a tight seal around your nose and mouth so becomes harder to breathe air in - you don’t really want to give people with respiratory systems,” he said. There is currently no vaccine to protect against the novel coronavirus, although researchers in the US and China have already begun working on one, thanks to China\u0027s prompt sharing of the virus\u0027s genetic code. However, any vaccine will not be available for up to a year and would most likely be given to health workers most at risk of contracting the virus. How the coronavirus spreadsFor now, it is a case of containment. China has started building a 1,000-bed hospital to treat patients with the virus which it hopes to finish within days.Department for Health \u0026amp Social CareNot so smart after all: How the \u0026#39smart motorway\u0026#39 roll-out has cost lives Comment: The reality is that there is a war going on at present, it\u0026#39s being fought out in cyberspaceLow skilled migrants to be restricted to time-limited job offers in shortage areas under new points systemBoris Johnson to defy warnings from Trump and own MPs to announce Huawei will build part of 5G networkSelf-harming by boys increases by 50 per cent in just four years, prompting warnings over role of social mediaComment: Here’s what it will mean to be a truly global Britain post-BrexitSmart motorways scandal: Highways Agency facing police probe over deaths of stranded driversPrince Andrew has not responded to FBI requests for interview over Epstein, prosecutor saysGary Lineker calls for BBC licence fee to be made voluntary as he brands it the broadcaster\u0026#39s \u0026#39fundamental problem\u0026#39 Home schooling drops for first time in four years, following crackdown on \u0026#39off-rolling\u0026#39Former Belgian king admits he fathered lovechild LA police grounded helicopters because of dangerous fog before Kobe Bryant crash Abuse victims to be given second phones to boost conviction rates\u0026#39The magnitude of the crime is terrifying\u0026#39: Tributes and tears as Holocaust survivors gather at Auschwitz\u0026#39s \u0026#39gates of death\u0026#39Man tried to steal Magna Carta from Salisbury Cathedral because he thought it was fake, court hearsDistinctive wines of Burgundy and Bordeaux could be lost forever, as climate change forces grape changeMimi Haley tells jury in Harvey Weinstein trial she felt \u0026#39like an idiot\u0026#39 after being raped by the producer Emily Thornberry praises Jeremy Corbyn for calling out racism at Holocaust Memorial Day event \u0026#39Naive\u0026#39 vicar faced disciplinary after parishioner who faked terminal illness accused him of impregnating her, tribunal hearsProstate cancer now the most commonly diagnosed form thanks to \u0026#39Turnbull and Fry\u0026#39 effectThe little known Holocaust memorial built by German schoolchildren that inspired a civil rights activistWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/27/TELEMMGLPICT000098557195_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqdNLuJDSj-bduoIdVkVeVwQYGEALd3jOglq7DTNTDy5U.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"nothing clever smart motorways time government u turn","story":"Emergency lay-bys are simply not as safe as the hard shoulderBritain’s smart motorways are inherently dangerous, of that there is now little doubt. Thirty-eight people have died on them in the past five years, and there have been a shocking number of near misses, where drivers have narrowly avoided crashing into a stationary vehicle on what would have been the hard shoulder but has become another lane of traffic to ease congestion. Can smart motorway lanes be made safe or should the concept be scrapped? With rapid investment poured into retrospectively fitting  hi-tech radar systems that detect stationary vehicles, the risks can be mitigated. But that will take time, and whether it would eliminate the intrinsic danger of not having a constant refuge for drivers alongside the slow lane is questionable even if more emergency lay-bys are put in, what are you meant to do if your car breaks down between the two?The safest thing to do would be to return all smart lanes to permanent hard shoulders. That requires a U-turn by the Government. But what was it John Maynard Keynes may or may not have said about changing his mind when the situation changed? The situation here has changed: 38 people have now been killed, and there is a worrying data black hole about the number of extraordinary near misses.This is an embarrassment as well as a tragedy, not only because the Government has effectively introduced danger to Britain’s safest form of road (motorways suffer the fewest crashes) but also because the policy is glaringly at odds with the entire car industry. The latter is currently prioritising three things as the cornerstones of its future viability: tech that can effectively communicate, safety and sustainability.Look at Volvo. One of its major marketing strategies has been the pledge that no one should be killed or seriously injured in one of its cars from 2020. Who’s to blame if someone smashes into an undetected, broken-down Volvo in an active smart lane and kills the occupants? That’s failed tech and failed safety in one fell swoop.European transport policies for the next decade are sharply defined by these three themes, favouring countries and manufacturers who get ahead of the pack. Despite Brexit, we are still part of a global automotive supply and product chain. As well as scrapping smart motorways, the Government needs to do some other rapid policy U-turns if its wants to attract manufacturer investment and remain a significant global player. The most obvious policy in need of reform is the scrapping of the Government grant for hybrids, and the £1,000 cut in the electric vehicle grant. This is the wrong policy for a sustainable UK car market. A quick glance at other European countries confirms the correlation between financial incentives for the purchase of electric cars and a nation’s lowering of its CO2 emissions.The only two that have not suffered an increase in CO2 emissions from cars in the past year are Norway and the Netherlands, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Both countries have government-driven financial incentives to buy electric cars, which are expensive. Without government support, the British public simply can’t afford to swap their petrol cars for electric versions.The third policy that is not fit for purpose is the Government’s stance on diesel. It has been demonised to the point of a tidal wave of local-authority bans on all diesel cars entering city centres. Very few motorists are now brave enough to buy diesels, yet they emit less CO2 than petrol engines, and without selling diesel cars, manufacturers have zero hope of reaching their mandated emissions targets while electric take-up is so low. Brands will end up paying mammoth fines – £85 per gram of CO2 per kilometre above the 95gkm threshold, per car that doesn’t meet the target. Who will suffer? What remains of the British car industry and, by extension, British workers. It is in the Government’s interest to publicly support diesel again, and perform similar rapid U-turns on electric car grants and smart motorways. Or they can trail a legacy of embarrassing automotive policy failures behind them for the next 10 years. Surely it’s a no-brainer.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

My mission to make our house more sustainable starts with thinking about making it warmer this week, I’ve been mostly thinking about thermostats.Given my day job is technology editor here at The Independent, it’s the technological solutions that seem most immediate. And starting with the thermostat seems an obvious one, given how much money and emissions are wasted on central heating.We recently got a smart thermostat, after struggling with a decidedly un-smart timer on our boiler. There was of course nothing green about that, given that it spent much of the time coming on when we weren’t even in. And there was plenty that wasn’t comfortable about it, either, since it would often be on when the house was too hot, or not in as we shivered in the cold. (In the end we gave up and mostly turned it off and on manually.)Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe have the Nest Thermostat E. (Nest, which is now owned by Google, are probably the most famous of the smart home companies, and the thermostat is probably their most famous product the E supposedly stands for a variety of things including “easy” and “energy-saving”, but basically means that it’s the cheaper version.) It works by getting your location and learning how you tend to like your heating, setting up a smart schedule and turning the heating off when you’re not there.So since the beginning of the year I’ve been thinking about how best we can optimise the amount of energy that thermostat uses. Though it is smart, it still works on what you tell it as such, you can change what sort of temperature you want it to be.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

So the main thing I’ve done is turn the heating down before we get into bed, ensuring that we aren’t wasting heat that will only be around once we’ve gone to bed. (Another of my personal pledges for 2020 is to ensure that I pay full attention to my sleep, after reading Matthew Walker’s luminous book on the subject, and this helps with that too.)Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThe Nest gives you a leaf when you’re being energy-\u0026nbspand eco-conscious by having the temperature lower than it might expect. And I feel generally rewarded, too: while there’s no real way to know the impact this is having on our own gas usage, it feels like we almost certainly are saving energy.Smart thermostats – or, if you are like me and didn’t have a non-smart one before, any kind of thermostat – feel like a wonderful symbol of how easy it can be to be more efficient. As it turns out, we aren’t much colder our house is still heated when we need it. It’s just that it won’t be heated when we’re not there, or when we’re already warm enough. Saving money and emissions on heating has actually made life easier.Getting one is expensive, of course: the Nest Thermostat E is £199, and you’ll have to pay for installation if you live in a confusing, complicated house like ours. But most people probably won’t need to, and there are plenty of deals and discount schemes from energy companies that should make it a little more easy to swallow.I suspect, as we head through the year of making our house more sustainable, that not all the changes we make will be quite so seamless, comfortable or sacrifice free. But I certainly hope so, because this feels like the kind of change that is incredibly nice to make, not only helping save the world in the tiniest way, but also saving money, and saving us from being cold.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Or Missguided. Or Nasty Gal. Or any other fast fashion brand that will pay them oodles of money to wear their clothes and sit in on a design meeting or two.\u0026nbspSince the ITV2 programme started in its current iteration, its contestants have gone on to land six-figure deals with fast fashion labels. Last season alone, female stars including Molly-Mae Hague, Maura Higgins and Amber Gill all landed up lucrative partnerships with Pretty Little Thing, Boohoo and MissPap, respectively – Gill’s is rumoured to be worth £1m. The men fared well\u0026nbsptoo\u0026nbsp– Ovie Soko got a deal with ASOS while Tommy Fury was snapped up by Boohoo Man.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes.

But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Cox won Best Actor in a TV Drama for\u0026nbsphis role as the media magnate Logan Roy\u0026nbspin Succession at the Golden Globes earlier this month.The actor, who recently claimed he was touched up by Princess Margaret, is not the first arts figure to criticise the British honours, which are awarded by the Queen.David Bowie, Danny Boyle, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, John Lennon and Benjamin Zephaniah are among those who have previously rejected CBEs, OBEs and MBEs.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Traditionally, fish balls were made of local fish species once widely available in Hong Kong waters. However, due to over-fishing and the industrialisation of food production, the iconic snack is now said to contain only 20 per cent fish or less, with substitute ingredients such as flour, chemical enhancers, pork and lard sometimes making up the bulk of the product.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market, if the merger hadn’t happened, and compete with Just Eat – so it’s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage – and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ms Melis suggested that deregulation after Brexit could help persuade financial services businesses to remain in the UK.“If the government can position the UK as having a more favourable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,” Melis said.Adopting a light-touch approach to regulation after Brexit – dubbed the “Singapore-on-Thames” model by some critics – would likely prove controversial.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No one beat Waits at his own game, though, the gravelly voiced king of the gutters used for the prolific drama’s second series. Regardless of who was singing, the message would remain the same: “When you walk through the garden  You gotta watch your back.”220 19) Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (“Unbreakable” by The Gregory Brothers and Mike Britt) (2015-2019)Having the YouTube-famous Gregory Brothers, responsible for viral hit “Bedroom Intruder”, remix a news report of the show’s protagonist being rescued from an underground cult for the theme song is unbelievably strange, but also brilliant. The warped, breakneck burst of bubblegum ridiculousness that it became is truly uncharted grounds, tearing down walls separating television, streaming services and video platforms in a very catchy fashion.320 18) Twin Peaks (“Twin Peaks Theme” by Angelo Badalamenti) (1990-2017)That they reused this theme for the recent Twin Peaks revival, an uncompromising, phantasmagoric trip through the mind of David Lynch, is intentionally and deliciously jarring, and that’s only because Badalementi’s theme so perfectly embodied the kitschy, nostalgia-drenched warmth of the original Nineties series, a simpler time. With ominous shadows lurking just beneath the beautiful crescendos, though, maybe Twin Peaks was never what it seemed.420 17) The Twilight Zone (“Main Title Theme” by Marius Constant) (1959-1964)The Twilight Zone, an anthology series that was light-years ahead of the curve, had a stellar soundtrack predating an impressive and abundant pantheon of great horror scores, spooking us way before we had Halloween or The Exorcist. It’s a bit of Frankenstein’s Monster, consisting of a number of promotional pieces haphazardly spliced together, but from the messy birth is a tense, ethereal and insanely influential hair-raiser. 520 16) Toast of London (“Take My Hand” by Matt Berry) (2012- )As sung by co-creator and lead actor Matt Berry, one of the most under-appreciated and multifaceted talents of the decade, “Take My Hand” is rousing and poignant. Toast of London, a gloriously abstract, untamed animal of a comedy, is often punctuated by unexpected bursts of Berry’s singing, though no other performance quite reaches the loveliness of this theme – an emotional anchor in a sea of weirdness.press image from Lis ClucasKuba WieczorekChannel 4620 15) The Sopranos (“Woke Up This Morning (Chosen One Mix)” by Alabama 3) (1999-2007)Alabama 3, an alternative rock band from Brixton, provides the theme song to a show that consistently outdoes itself with its music choices (see also: the series’ final few minutes). “Woke Up This Morning (Chosen One Mix)” is greasy and sleazy and Tom Waits-ish, a swamp of ominous synths and guitar licks, dipping into the weirder and artsier tendencies that The Sopranos would often ulge in. 720 14) The Simpsons (“The Simpsons Theme” by Danny Elfman) (1989- )With each title sequence, The Simpsons continually finds news way for America’s favourite family to come together on their couch, although the soundtrack to these journeys remains an unchanging monument. Honestly, “The Simpsons Theme” has transcended iconic status and is essentially a holy text by this point excluding it from this list would have been sacrilegious. Shout out to Lisa who always knocks her sax solo out of the park.820 13) Postman Pat (“Postman Pat \u0026amp His Black and White Cat” by Bryan Daly) (1981-2006)This sleepy little lullaby of a theme song recalls the sensation of first waking in the morning, enthused by the feeling that everything is okay in the world. Bryan Daly’s almost whispered vocals speak of a heart-warming, enviously simple life for our hero Pat and his black and white cat “Pat feels he’s a really happy man.” It’s a doorway to a world that, no matter the age, you would be happy to settle into.920 12) The Office UK (“Handbags and Gladrags” arranged by Big George) (2001-2003)What Gervais and Merchant’s version of The Office does so well is to embrace the humanity of everyday life, at-times hilarious, at-times pathetic. “Handbags and Gladrags”, originally written by Mike D’Abo of Manfred Mann but repurposed here by Big George, is unashamedly sombre and hungover. It sounds like that contrasting look of persistence to achieve better things and resigned acceptance on the face of every Monday morning commuter.1020 11) M*A*S*H (“Suicide is Painless” by Johnny Mandel) (1972-1983)The lyrics to “Suicide is Painless”, omitted from the television title sequence but so married to the melody that they hang over it like a ghost, are heart-wrenching. They draw out the tragic, underlying nature of M*A*S*H, a comedy at heart, with their absence only highlighting the repression of this sadness. It’s unique and unprecedented in the sense that, each time it plays, it forces you to reconsider what it is you are about to see.1120 10) Knight Rider (“Knight Rider Theme” by Stu Phillips and Glen A. Larson) (1982-1986)The “Knight Rider Theme”, composed of pulsating, tensile synths and ticking programmed drums, is a very Eighties, Blade Runner-esque prediction of what the future would sound like: apocalyptic, sleek and synthetic. A bit like KITT itself, it’s nowhere near being timeless in that sense, but it’s undoubtedly cool even as a product of its time. 1220 9) It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia (“Temptation Sensation” by Heinz Kiessling) (2005- )The It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia title sequence is all about ingenious contrasts. The episode titles often hilariously contradict the prior few minutes (see: “I’m gonna save my Dad!” into “Mac Kills His Dad), the shots of nighttime Philadelphia prove it’s not actually “always sunny”, and, best of all, the theme song hints at a certain lusciousness and grace. This, of course, is never the case. That “Temptation Sensation” is public domain makes it even more perfect.1320 8) Happy Days (“Happy Days” by Pratt \u0026amp McClain) (1974-1984)Faced with declining ratings, Happy Days doubled down on the feel-good factor and comedy aspects for the third series. This new theme song, replacing the equally recognisable “Rock Around the Clock”, follows suit, borrowing the same idea of making the most of the time we have but blowing it out to its most cheery, broad and archetypal potential.1420 7) Friends (“I’ll Be There For You” by The Rembrandts) (1994-2004)The Rembrandts got it pretty spot on – no matter what you do to escape it, this song will always be there. A bit like an over-eager best friend, the track brings a certain comfort, a sense of normality and is boundlessly, almost annoyingly joyful. You can’t help but love it unconditionally.1520 6) The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (“Yo Home to Bel Air” by The Fresh Prince) (1990-1996)Never before has a backstory been so endlessly recitable. Pop maestro Quincy Jones collaborated with renowned 80s hip hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff and the The Fresh Prince, who happened to be starring in the show, to create a genuine cultural touchstone in just 15 minutes. Much like his character, Will Smith makes everything he does look completely effortless, including writing a theme song for the ages.1620 5) Doctor Who (“Doctor Who Theme Music” by Ron Grainer) (1963- )The fact that this theme still evokes the excitement of stepping into new worlds almost 60 years on is telling. Composed in the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, Ron Grainer and Delia Derbyshire’s otherworldly masterpiece has let loose the imaginations (and nightmares) of children for decades, itself a small but sturdy vessel that transcends time and space.1720 4) Dad’s Army (“Who Do You Think You Are Kidding, Mr Hitler?” by Bud Flanagan) (1968-1977)Distinctly unimposing and charming yet equipped with a biting sense of self-depreciation and an unmatched persistence, the theme for Dad’s Army perfectly captures British spirit. In fact, dismissing Hitler’s reign as a “little game” may be one of the most devastatingly British blows ever landed. Bud Flanagan, a vaudevillian comic in his own right, outdid himself.1820 3) Curb Your Enthusiasm (“Frolic” by Luciano Michelini) (2000- )Just beating out Seinfeld’s iconic slap bass is the hilariously cocksure clown march that soundtracks Larry David’s second masterpiece, Curb Your Enthusiasm. “There was something circus-y about it,” he once explained. “It tells the audience: don’t take this seriously.” It’s near-impossible to hear it without picturing a slow zoom into his helpless face, forever mocking his inability to understand a world that goes right over his bald, emblematic head.1920 2) Cheers (“Where Everybody Knows Your Name” by Gary Portnoy) (1982-1993)The quintessential theme song, almost unanimously agreed upon as the greatest of all time. Gary Portnoy’s “Where Everybody Knows Your Name” is that warm rush you feel stepping in from the cold or, more aptly, a much-needed beer after a long day. A deep exhalation of a programme, Cheers was that sense of relief for so many people, and the theme couldn’t have captured or acknowledged that more perfectly.2020 1) Batman (“Batman Theme” by Neal Hefti) (1966-1968)From the giddy, opening horn flourish to the driving guitar, the chorus of “Batman”’s to the hits of brass choreographed to our hero punching out crooks, you’d be hard pressed to find a better-known superhero theme. Although the franchise would return to darker places, the unabashed campness here harks back to the innocence of watching cartoons on weekend mornings.120 20) The Wire (“Way Down in the Hole” by Tom Waits) (2002-2008)A rotating cast of musicians were tasked with covering Tom Waits’ formidable dirge “Way Down in the Hole” for The Wire’s theme, including Steve Earle and The Blind Boys of Alabama. No one beat Waits at his own game, though, the gravelly voiced king of the gutters used for the prolific drama’s second series. Regardless of who was singing, the message would remain the same: “When you walk through the garden  You gotta watch your back.”220 19) Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (“Unbreakable” by The Gregory Brothers and Mike Britt) (2015-2019)Having the YouTube-famous Gregory Brothers, responsible for viral hit “Bedroom Intruder”, remix a news report of the show’s protagonist being rescued from an underground cult for the theme song is unbelievably strange, but also brilliant. The warped, breakneck burst of bubblegum ridiculousness that it became is truly uncharted grounds, tearing down walls separating television, streaming services and video platforms in a very catchy fashion.320 18) Twin Peaks (“Twin Peaks Theme” by Angelo Badalamenti) (1990-2017)That they reused this theme for the recent Twin Peaks revival, an uncompromising, phantasmagoric trip through the mind of David Lynch, is intentionally and deliciously jarring, and that’s only because Badalementi’s theme so perfectly embodied the kitschy, nostalgia-drenched warmth of the original Nineties series, a simpler time. With ominous shadows lurking just beneath the beautiful crescendos, though, maybe Twin Peaks was never what it seemed.420 17) The Twilight Zone (“Main Title Theme” by Marius Constant) (1959-1964)The Twilight Zone, an anthology series that was light-years ahead of the curve, had a stellar soundtrack predating an impressive and abundant pantheon of great horror scores, spooking us way before we had Halloween or The Exorcist. It’s a bit of Frankenstein’s Monster, consisting of a number of promotional pieces haphazardly spliced together, but from the messy birth is a tense, ethereal and insanely influential hair-raiser. 520 16) Toast of London (“Take My Hand” by Matt Berry) (2012- )As sung by co-creator and lead actor Matt Berry, one of the most under-appreciated and multifaceted talents of the decade, “Take My Hand” is rousing and poignant. Toast of London, a gloriously abstract, untamed animal of a comedy, is often punctuated by unexpected bursts of Berry’s singing, though no other performance quite reaches the loveliness of this theme – an emotional anchor in a sea of weirdness.press image from Lis ClucasKuba WieczorekChannel 4620 15) The Sopranos (“Woke Up This Morning (Chosen One Mix)” by Alabama 3) (1999-2007)Alabama 3, an alternative rock band from Brixton, provides the theme song to a show that consistently outdoes itself with its music choices (see also: the series’ final few minutes). “Woke Up This Morning (Chosen One Mix)” is greasy and sleazy and Tom Waits-ish, a swamp of ominous synths and guitar licks, dipping into the weirder and artsier tendencies that The Sopranos would often ulge in. 720 14) The Simpsons (“The Simpsons Theme” by Danny Elfman) (1989- )With each title sequence, The Simpsons continually finds news way for America’s favourite family to come together on their couch, although the soundtrack to these journeys remains an unchanging monument.

But it did say that it will be moving the logos of the pages on search results – known as favicons – in an attempt to make them more palatable to users.Google search results get unusual new updateLast week we updated the look of Search on desktop to mirror what’s been on mobile for months, Google said in a post from one of its official search liaison accounts. We’ve heard your feedback about the update. We always want to make Search better, so we’re going to experiment with new placements for faviconsOur experimenting will begin today.

On one side, I’m very grateful that what I make can be acknowledged in a world like this, but also it sucks that whenever we – and I mean guys that look like me – do anything that’s genre-bending, they always put it in the rap or urban category.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I don’t like that ‘urban’ word, it’s just a politically correct way to say the ‘n’ word to me.”Created with Sketch.The 50 best albums of 2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold.

(AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. He added: “So when I hear that I’m like, ‘Why can’t we just be in pop, do you know what I mean?’ Half of me feels like the rap nomination was a backhanded compliment, like, ‘Oh, my little cousin wants to play the game, let’s give him the unplugged controller so he can shut up and feel good about it.’Nick Jonas performed at Grammys with food in his teethAll the Grammys 2020 winnersThe 4 biggest talking points from the Grammy Awards 2020The artist’s win is his first-ever Grammy triumph after being nominated two other times, for Flower Boy in 2018 and as a feature on Frank Ocean’s Channel Orange in 2013.He performed at the ceremony at the Staples Centre\u0026nbspin Los Angeles and, shortly after the win, Jaden Smith,\u0026nbspwho has previously teased fans\u0026nbspabout the nature of his and Tyler’s relationship, tweeted: “My boyfriend just won a Grammy.”Tyler the Creator\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yomari consists of an external cover of rice flour and an inner content of sweets known as chaku and the mild-based khuwa. They sell for about 65 Nepali rupees or 60 US cents per dumpling. The yomari were traditionally prepared as a specialty dish by members of the ethnic Newari community in Nepal for their festival, but demand became so great that they are now sold throughout the year. According to myth Kubera, the Hindu god of wealth and prosperity, liked the yomari so much upon tasting it that he foretold anyone who makes it will be blessed with wealth and prosperityA vendor selling seekh kebabs and other non-vegetarian food on Mira Road, in the outskirts of Mumbai. Seekh kebabs are popular, especially among Muslim people. They are made of meat, most often mutton, lamb, beef or chicken, and served with various accompaniments.

The snail soup is made with lake snails, caught by hand by farmers in the provinces around Phnom Penh. The dish offers customers a traditional provincial style of food compared to the majority of restaurants in Cambodia that offer Chinese, western or neighboring Asian nations cuisine, only a few offer traditional Cambodian fare. The restaurant specialises in cooking snail soup and steamed frog with small rocksA woman puts a betel package, called quid, into her mouth made and sold at a street stall in Naypyitaw.  Betel quids, known as Kunya, are very popular in Myanmar, made of tobacco and small pieces of betel nut wrapped in a betel leaf and spread with a lime paste that are placed into the mouth to suck and chew. Betel is the seed of the Areca palm, and while it\u0027s consumption is common in Asia and the Pacific, it is banned in many western countries due to its negative health effects. It also leads to the red stained teeth and mouths, and the red pavement spit that goes along with the experienceLa Loma district, in Manila, is famous for its roasted pig stores known as Lechon, a popular Filipino delicacy. Lechon is the Spanish word for a young suckling pig, that is then slowly roasted over charcoal.

It is one of the most popular street foods in IndonesiaA street vendor prepares deep-fried curry fish balls, a street snack especially loved by young people, in Mong Kok, a busy night life district of Kowloon in Hong Kong. Since the so-called \u0027 fish ball revolution\u0027 riot in Mong Kok in 2016, where a crowd of New Year revellers tried to push a cart of boiling oil towards health officials who were checking for unlicensed street hawkers, the snack has also become a symbol of identity of the Hong Kong people\u0027s resistance to perceived creeping authoritarianism from China. Traditionally, fish balls were made of local fish species once widely available in Hong Kong waters. However, due to over-fishing and the industrialisation of food production, the iconic snack is now said to contain only 20 per cent fish or less, with substitute ingredients such as flour, chemical enhancers, pork and lard sometimes making up the bulk of the product. Despite this, in 2012, local media Apple Daily reported that 375,000,000 fish balls were consumed per dayA vendor arranges fried insects on her street food cart on Khao San Road in Bangkok. The road houses many kinds of food but the most popular are fresh fruits, fried insects and pad thai. Fried insects attract the attention of tourists from all over the world. Bugs have been on the menu in Thailand for ages but a few years ago they have migrated from the forests to commercial farms and factories. The most popular method of preparation is to deep-fry crickets in oil and then sprinkle them with lemongrass slivers and chilis. They are crunchy and taste like fried shrimp. Pad thai is a stir-fried rice noodle dish commonly served as street food and at most restaurants in ThailandA man sells baozi, or Chinese steamed meat buns, at a business district in Beijing.

However, due to over-fishing and the industrialisation of food production, the iconic snack is now said to contain only 20 per cent fish or less, with substitute ingredients such as flour, chemical enhancers, pork and lard sometimes making up the bulk of the product.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market, if the merger hadn’t happened, and compete with Just Eat – so it’s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage – and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ms Melis suggested that deregulation after Brexit could help persuade financial services businesses to remain in the UK.“If the government can position the UK as having a more favourable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,” Melis said.Adopting a light-touch approach to regulation after Brexit – dubbed the “Singapore-on-Thames” model by some critics – would likely prove controversial.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is a responsibility thing. Maybe it’s because I was a Boy Scout,’ says Thomas MarkleThomas Markle, father of the Duchess of Sussex, has said he is willing to testify against her as part of the legal action Meghan is taking against specific tabloid stories regarding her relationship with him.In an interview with The Sun – his first since Prince Harry and Meghan announced they were walking away from royal duties – Thomas said he would testify against “the things that have been said about me” related to a letter allegedly unlawfully published by the Daily Mail.He said: “When me and Meghan end up in a courtroom together, it will be quite stunning for everybody.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It will be emotional. I don’t know how we will both accept it,” he said, and added “everything will come out” in court.“This is my fault so I have to stand up for myself. It is a responsibility thing.

That means all her phone records, as well as mine. And I don’t think she wants that to happen.The publisher’s lawyers accused the duchess of being more concerned about the “unflattering” effect of the published letter extracts than any breach of her data protection rights.In court documents, the publisher also argues that an article in US People was sanctioned by the duchess and its effect “was to suggest that Mr Markle has made false claims about his dealings with his daughter and that he was entirely at fault in not attending the royal wedding and for the estrangement between himself and the claimant”.Can Prince Harry and Meghan Markle still use the Sussex Royal brand?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle fail in bid to trademark Sussex RoyalMeghan Markle doesn’t ‘owe’ her father a thing – despite what he saysThomas gave the Mail on Sunday access to the letter from his daughter after an US People article was published in which five anonymous people claiming to be Meghan’s “best friends” spoke about his relationship with Meghan.One friend said: “He’s never called he’s never texted. It’s super painful, because Meg was always so dutiful. I think she will always feel genuinely devastated by what he’s done.”Thomas said he went to the Mail on Sunday because he “wanted to defend myself for what was being said by those five people”.He added: “I think Meghan had a huge role in it. Now it is my obligation to turn up and give evidence.The letter Meghan sent to her father is believed to be the last communication between the pair, after their relationship completely broke down in the week of her wedding to Harry in May 2018.Mail on Sunday\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The video has since gone viral and the oil worker shared an update on the kittens’ health.Writing on Facebook, Mr Diwisch said: “So today I found these three fellows on one of the back roads near one of my wells. Most likely dropped off. Poor things were frozen into the ice so they had to have been there all night.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“All three little rascals went to their new home today where they get to be together instead of separating them. All three are eating and drinking and very energetic. Thanks for everyone’s consideration and offering to take them very appreciated.”The video, captured last Wednesday, shows Mr Diwisch approaching the poor kittens in the snow. He can be heard talking on camera, saying: “Look at these little guys. It’s alright, it’s ok. You’re frozen to the ice. Have you been here all night?”One of the cats is free but his friends have their tails frozen to the ground. Once Mr Diwisch sees this he goes to his truck, brings back warm coffee, pours it on the felines and is able to get them free.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester holds a sign reading On the move mocking the LREM party\u0027s slogan during a demonstration in Paris, as part as a nationwide multi-sector strike against the French government\u0027s pensions overhaulA Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

So far there had been “zero cooperation”, he told reporters.“The original charges against Jeffrey Epstein contained a conspiracy charge, and we alleged that there were conspirators involved, and Jeffrey Epstein couldn’t have done what he did without the assistance of others, and I can assure you that our investigation is moving forward,” Mr Berman said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNicholas Biase at the US Attorney’s Office in New York confirmed to\u0026nbspThe Independent that Prince Andrew had\u0026nbspnot offered any cooperation, and the office was working in close coordination with the FBI to get him to speak with authorities. He could not comment about the timelines of their correspondence and when they last spoke with his representatives. Previously, the prince said he would cooperate “if required”.The prince has repeatedly denied accusations levelled at him, most powerfully by Virginia Giuffre, who has claimed she was\u0026nbsptrafficked by the disgraced late US\u0026nbspfinancier, and forced to have sex with his friends, including the British prince\u0026nbspwhen she was 17 years old. She said the assaults took place in\u0026nbspLondon, New York and Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands.Created with Sketch.

In his BBC interview, he said was prepared to give testimony under oath “if push came to shove and the legal advice was to do so”.Later, announcing his decision to stand away from his royal duties for “the foreseeable future”, he added: “Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.”\u0026nbspPrincess Eugenie breaks social media silence with unseen photoRoyals who stepped back from their duties before Harry and MeghanGraham Norton shocks audience with Meghan Markle jokesThe prince was one of many celebrities and high-profile figures to have at one of time or other associated with Epstein, including Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, Robert Maxwell and even Donald Trump.Most broke off contact with him after he pleaded guilty to a charge of sex with a minor in 2008 and sentenced to 13 months in jail.But Prince Andrew maintained the friendship, even staying at his house in New York after his\u0026nbspreleased from jail in 2010, something he has since said was an error.In the summer of 2019, Epstein, 66, was arrested and charged with trafficking dozens of girls and young women, charges he denied.

Salvini knows how to talk about problems, but he doesn’t know how to sort them out and the people have responded,” Mr Zingaretti added.Turnout hit 68 per cent in the election, up around 30 percentage points from the last comparable contest in 2014 – with the highly polarised campaign drawing voters to the polls.A defeat for progressive forces in Emilia-Romagna would have been the jewel in the far-right’s crown: the region has long been the heartland of the Italian Communist Party and its successors.But Mr Salvini’s alliance, which takes in other party’s from Italy’s right wing, has still won nine out of ten regional elections since March 2018 –\u0026nbspincluding in former left-leaning area such as Umbria.The League’s allies also won in Calabria on Sunday, a smaller region in the south of Italy whose population numbers around 2\u0026nbspmillion compared to Emilia-Romagna’s 4.5 million. The right’s 11 per cent swing in the latter also represents progress on the last contest.But the defeat in the northern region, including its capital of Bologna, is the latest setback for the populists –\u0026nbspwho were locked out of national government last year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He asked: ‘How old are you ’ I said ‘sixteen’, Ivor tells Sun Online.For a millisecond, he stopped, then he said: ‘Alright, go to the right, meaning to the workers’ side.It was a lucky escape for the young Hungarian who wouldve been sent to his deathMengele realised he was only a child - and no use for hard labour.Ivors mother and seven of his siblings were sent left to their deaths in Auschwitz gas chambers— he never saw any of them again.Today,  years since the liberation of Auschwitz, -year-old Ivor still can’t comprehend the horrors of the worst extermination camp the world has ever known.“The truth sounds so horric - it’s very hard to comprehend what happened, Ivor says .But it’s even harder to believe it could happen againone is not careful.Growing up in Southern Hungary in the s, Ivor was no stranger to anti-Semitism.“Going to school was, literally, like running the gauntlet. There was nothing unusual about being cursed at or spat at or even punched.“But, somehow or another, that was part and parcel of le. You accepted that you were a Jew - so you were entitled to suffer for it.”As an ally of the Axis powers, Hungary fought alongside the Nazis during World War Two.Leading up to and throughout the war, the Hungarian government passed a raft of anti-Semitic laws emulating those introduced by Hitler in Germany.Jews were forced out of their jobs, had to abide by a curfew and were forbidden from marrying Christians.They stopped short of enacting Hitler’s final solution — the planned genocide of the Jewish people — but still sent thousands of working-age Jews, including Ivor’s father and elder brother, to labour battalions.These groups were Nazi Germany’s army of slaves staffed by the regimes’ racially persecuted populations.They were forced to carry out back-breaking work on the frontline, forbidden from defending themselves with weapons, and they were even made to clear minefields with their bare hands.By  it was clear Germany would lose the war. Knowing this, Hungary made peace overtures to the Allied forces.When German High Command got wind of the negotiations they invaded and annexed Hungary, bringing their murderous campaign of anti-Semitism with them.“Literally, within two or three months the whole Jewish population was practically wiped out,” Ivor says.“Everything was very gradual, and everything that happened gradually, you would say: ‘Well, we can manage, it’s not too bad,’ until it was too late to do anything about it.”Ivor remembers the Nazis telling them they would be put on trains and transported east, where there was farmland waiting for them to live and be free of anti-Semitism.In reality, the trains went straight to Auschwitz.Ivor and his family, along with hundreds of other Jews, were crammed into cattle trucks for the long journey to the camp.Without food, water, or adequate ventilation many didn’t live to see the doors open at the other end.After three nightmarish days, the train pulled to a halt. Ivor could see inmates in striped unorms through the slats of the cattle truck shouting at the new arrivals in Yiddish.He heard them yell: “Eat all the food! Don’t save any food! Children, who are asked, must say they are at least sixteen years or older!”It was advice that would save his le.Ivor had arrived at Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest of a number of sub-camps that comprised the Auschwitz complex.More than .million people lost their lives inside its barbed wire fences.Stripped of their belongings, then shaved, Jews and other persecuted groups were sent straight to the gas chambers on arrival.After all had perished, the SS guards forced other Jewish prisoners to clear the bodies from the chambers and move them to the crematorium to be burned — Ivor’s elder brother was one of the tragic inmates forced to carry out this gruesome task.“I don’t know what happened to him, but none of those people survived more than four weeks. After four weeks they rotated them, and they themselves were burned,” Ivor says.As well as extermination, Auschwitz was used as a holding camp for those deemed healthy and old enough to be sent to the Nazi’s network of slave labour camps inside Germany.Selection took place on arrival, often overseen by head camp doctor Josef Mengele.Mengele’s sickening legacy has earned him the macabre moniker ‘the Angel of Death’.A former SS captain, he was sent to Auschwitz in  by Hitler’s second in command, Heinrich Himmler.As head camp doctor, Mengele oversaw a program of barbaric and inhumane medical experiments, often on children, in particular twins, by which he hoped to prove the Nazi’s crackpot theory of Aryan racial dominance.Ironically, it was Ivor’s strictly religious Jewish upbringing, and subsequent understanding of Yiddish, that saved his le.Standing face-to-face with Mengele, the words of the Jewish prisoners fresh in his mind, -year-old Ivor lied, telling Mengele he was sixteen.“If I hadnt known Yiddish, I wouldn’t have known what he meant. So when he asked me, ‘How old are you  I would’ve said .He would never have let me liveI had said I was .”Instead, Ivor was sent to Birkenau’s labour camp, along with his brother Alec.His mother and seven of his sisters were sent straight to the gas chambers.Remembering the Nazi’s cruelty, Ivor still cant believe how callous they were when confronted with human suffering.“My youngest sister was herded into a gas chamber and into a fire, he says. Even now, I think: How could people do that ”After the selection process, Ivor and his brother were marched to the camp’s barracks where they were met by a kapo — a prisoner, usually a German criminal, who supervised the camp’s slave labour workforce.He told them: “You have arrived at a place called Auschwitz, dont you forget it. You’re being given a number now.You do not exist without this number. Forget this number and you will not live.”To prove his point, two other kapos then brought a prisoner into the barracks and held him spreadeagled on the ground in front of the new arrivals.As the prisoner was ‘punished’ he told them: “This is what’s going to happen to you anytime you do something you’re not supposed to.”Suddenly Ivor began to cry.Le in the Nazi work camps was brutal and often short. Back-breaking slave labour, lack of food and horric camp conditions killed many thousands of prisoners.Ivor says the desperate struggle for survival dehumanised him — which is exactly what the camps were designed to do.“You didnt have any clothes, you didnt have any food, you didnt have anything so anything you could get hold of you grabbed.So,you went to bed with someone and the person died next to you the first thing you kept on saying is: ‘Can I use their clothes ’“How you knew that someone had died next to you, you could see the fleas flying away from the body, then you realise the person next to you is dead.“I feel ashamed of what humanity can do, and scared,people don’t take notice, what they can do again.”In Early , German defeat was in sight. Soviet troops were bearing down on the camp from the east while Allied forces fought their way across Germany from the west.Hoping to conceal the horror of their crimes from the eyes of the world, the Nazis moved the prisoners, abandoning Auschwitz as they attempted to destroy evidence of the camp.Prisoners were taken to Allach, a work camp in the heart of Germany, then on to Dachau — the first of many concentration camps built by the Nazis during World War Two.Ivor recalls the sickening scenes that prisoners arrived to at both camps.“The first thing that greeted you when you went to another camp was the amount of wheelbarrows with dead people on them. In other words, death was always in front of you.”In Spring of  after a year in the Nazi’s clutches, Ivor and his brother were liberated by American troops.They were taken to a displaced persons camp where it was confirmed that, out of their entire family, they were the only two left alive.In November  the two brothers came to Britain, where Ivor met his future we, Rhoda.It was here that his sadistic legacy was cemented as he gleefully volunteered to run the selection process - where new arrivals were sent into slavery or straight to the gas chambers.Most Auschwitz doctors found the selection process unpleasant - but Mengele smiled and whistled a happy tune as he sent millions to their deaths.Mengele was partly interested in running the horric selection process so he could find subjects for his notorious medical experiments, looking especially for young twins.His cruel experiments disregarded the safety or wellbeing of their participants - who he made call him Uncle Mengele.Twins would have limbs unnecessarily amputated, have forced blood transfusions with each other, and had chemicals injected into their eyes so they would change colour.Mengele also sewed two Romani twins together in a bid to make them conjoined - both children died from rotting flesh after days in agony.Its unclear how many children he killed, but in just one night Mengele is known to have killed  twins by injecting chloroform into their hearts.After the war, he fled to Brazil where he lived the rest of his le in hiding.He died in  when he had a stroke and drowned while swimming in the sea - he was buried under a  name, but DNA testing on his exhumed remains confirmed his identity in .Together they have four children.Seventy-five years since Auschwitzs liberation and his ordeal there, Ivor is adamant the best antidote to hate is love.“I can genuinely say that, in human nature, in le, in marriage, in everything, love will get you a lot further and a lot better results than hatred.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The project is already massively over budget, it may well break the £billion mark soon, and running a decade late.A row about what to do about it is brewing in the Tory party.“HS is building up to be quite a serious disagreement within the party,” says one leading backbencher.Birmingham Tories are keen to save the scheme, believing it to be key to the re-election prospects of their West Midlands Mayor Andy Street.One argument they are deploying is that going ahead with HS would make it easier for the Government to scrap the third runway at Heathrow.They point out that when David Cameron backed the scheme while the Tories were in opposition, it was, in part, as an alternative to Heathrow expansion.Given that Boris Johnson has said he would lie down in front of the bulldozers before he allowed a third runway to be built, it would be extremely embarrassing for himthe project proceeded.But for a Prime Minister, who boasts of his commitment to infrastructure, to scrap two of the biggest transport projects in the country would be politically dficult. This might well be what saves HS, in some form.This Government knows what it wants to do.But the real challenge is actually delivering on this agenda, of ensuring that, when Boris Johnson pulls the levers, something happens.I UNDERSTAND that Boris Johnson is keen to amalgamate the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office this year.His experience as Foreign Secretary has left him convinced that you need to align the two departments.The UK will, though, remain committed to spending . per cent of national income on foreign aid.In preparation for this beefed-up role for the Foreign Office, I’m told Rob Oxley – the Prime Minister’s Press Secretary – is heading there to work for Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary.Oxley was with Boris and Dominic Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign before working with them in Downing Street.He is a trusted member of their team and his presence in the Foreign Office will ensure smooth relations between Downing Street and the FCO.He is also across the international issues, having previously been a special adviser at both the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development.KEIR STARMER is out in front in the Labour leadership race.He has four times as many nominations from constituency Labour parties as any other candidate. Right now, this race is his to lose.If Starmer does win, it will consolidate a change in British politics. He will find it easier to squeeze Liberal Democrat voters in the south than to win back those Leave voters Labour have lost in the Midlands and the North in recent years. Labour’s sht to being a party of urban graduates will continue under him.The problem for Labour is that this approach simply will not win them enough seats to govern.In a generation’s time, it may well work. But not now. Starmer’s supporters argue that he comes without Jeremy Corbyn’s baggage and that many of the voters Labour lost at the last election will come back to the party as soon as they are offered a credible leader. This, though, seems an optimistic reading of events.One supporter of another candidate claims that the sense Starmer “looks the part” and “you can imagine him as PM” is just because he is a man. “Never underestimate the sexism of the Labour party,” she complains.NIGEL FARAGE will vote for the withdrawal agreement when it comes before the European Parliament next week. Farage had previously been a trenchant critic of the deal.He has described it as “awful”, “ per cent the same as Mrs May’s deal” and “a Remainer’s Brexit”. But he’s been convinced by the Government’s statements about how it doesn’t intend to be a rule-taker after Brexit.For this reason – and because it would look absurd for him to vote against Brexit – he will now back the deal. Farage plans to leave UK politics on January . But he intends to keep a watching brief, saying he is prepared toto the frayBoris Johnson’s government pulls back from its current position.Farage’s experience with the Brexit Party, which went from launch to topping the poll in the European elections in a matter of weeks, has persuaded him that new political parties can have an instant impact when required.THE row over a potential peerage for John Bercow is not going to go away. He is claiming he is entitled to one.But the Government is keen to stop the former Speaker getting one given how he twisted parliamentary procedure to aid those MPs who were trying to block Boris Johnson on Brexit.Meanwhile, the former chief clerk of the House of Commons, Lord Lisvane, has made a formal complaint alleging that Bercow bullied staff.One MP who Bercow appointed to the  of chairs tells me the most likely outcome to the row is that the House of Lords Appointments Commission does not accept Jeremy Corbyn’s nomination of Bercow.But rather than rejecting it outright, it will say “not now” and insist that all proceedings relating to Bercow’s alleged bullying are dealt with before a decision is made on whether he can go to the Lords or not.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Network Rail wants to move a mile-long stretch of track that runs beside a beach in Devon, saying it’s vulnerable to falling rocks AND pounding waves.Protesters say this is nonsense, and they’re right. Simple as.Yes, the track is vulnerable. In  it was destroyed by a storm and, while it was being repaired, Cornwall was effectively cut off from the rest of the country.But this bit of track, designed and built by Brunel, is extremely pretty and charming and that, in the coming years, is going to matter more than a few Corns being cut off for a week or two.As we leave Europe, we have in our minds that we will be a modern, dynamic nation with magnetic levitation transportation systems linking all the towns and villages. We see glass towers piercing the clouds in Rochdale and space ports in Basingstoke.Ain’t going to happen.If we decide that everything old-fashioned and historical must go to make le more modern, then we can wave goodbye to the Tower of London, because that piece of real estate should obviously be sold to commercial developers.They say the submersibles these people use are causing “untold damage” to the ship.Hmm. Not half as much damage as the iceberg did, I’ll wager.The Roman walls in York  Stupid. Replace them with nuclear free peace cafes. Stonehenge  Smash it up and build polytunnels.And while we are at it, we can turn Portmeirion into a wind farm, capitalise on the crescent in Bath with advertising hoardings and replace all the dry stone walls in the Yorkshire Dales with plastic fencing.Oh, and then there’s the Royal Family.It’s obviously idiotic to have a system of government where you can become head of state just because you’re the first-born child of a German woman and a Greek man. So let’s get rid of that and have a president instead. That way, we could have someone we know in Buckingham Palace. Piers Morgan perhaps. Or Phillip Schofield.The fact is that Britain is a boutique.Millions of foreign visitors come every year to marvel at our pomp and tradition. They love our changing of the guard, and our castles and our awkward Elizabethan houses. They laugh at us when we try to be modern but lap up our Rolls-Royces and our Bentleys which are made, by Germans, to feel as old-fashioned as the Queen’s underwear drawer.We send a young, fresh band to the Eurovision Song Contest and it comes last. Then the judges go home to listen to The Beatles and The Who.We need to capitalise on that. We need the red telephone boxes back. We need warty peasants on every street corner and lots of men tipping their bowler hats when they see a lady.Because then, tourists will be queuing round the block to give us their dollars and their dongs.And we can start by leaving that pretty bit of railway line in Devon alone.Yes, it’ll mean that from time to time Cornwall will be cut off. But I’m willing to bet a lot of Corns won’t mind that. Because being isolated and stuck and hungry is part of what we are as well.This week she stood still and insisted Prince Charles crossed the room to greet her. And after they had shaken hands and exchanged pleasantries, she turned to the photographers and called a halt to proceedings.I’m not sure she had a clue who Charlie Boy was. But then she doesn’t have much of a clue about anything.A FEW weeks ago, many people were upset when I suggested that God had set fire to Australia.I realise now that this was a stupid thing to say. Of course God did not set fire to it. The Green movement did.Yes, climate change causes longer, hotter spells that increase the likelihood of a fire starting. But what made it became so huge was ill-informed eco thinking.In recent years, Australians have faced huge finesthey cut down a tree or even collect fallen branches.This means that when a fire starts, it has a ton of dry wood to get its teeth into. The Aboriginals understood this. The early white settlers did too. That’s why they had controlled fires to manage the land properly.Sadly, though, ecomentals don’t understand this.So, by trying to save the country’s wildle, they’ve ended up incinerating it.However, it turns out that Land Rover was able to work out that, on the night in question, the car had been at the scene.Obviously, it’s great that technology can be used in this way. But I have a Range Rover and I’m not sure I like thinking that some herbert in Solihull knows where I am  hours a day. CHANNEL  News achieved new heights of unbalanced reporting this week while covering a pro-gun march in America.Instead of asking protesters why they wanted a machine gun, and then allowing the viewer to make up their mind, the reporter pounced on a family and asked the children why they were there.Needless to say, the kids had no clue and turned in baffled silence to their parents.I’m willing to bet, however, thatyou asked kids on an eco march why they were there, you’d get exactly the same response.But would Channel  News do that  Don’t hold your breath.I told the woman my name was Jeremy Clarkson. I told her the name on my credit card was Jeremy Clarkson. And that my account was in the name of Jeremy Clarkson.And when I’d finished, she said, with some excitement: “Hey!!

Foreign students will get two years to find a job after graduating.And a new points-based system will keep us open to the brightest and best.Unskilled migrants will be filtered out — but they will get more points for working in an industry short of labour.We DO want lower overall migration. The pressure on wages, the NHS, housing and so on is unsustainable.But it is already sharply down on . And even the prospect of ending free movement has dramatically relegated immigration in the list of the nation’s priorities.We MUST, though, be far tougher on illegals who reach our shores, and vastly increase the tiny percentage we deport.That will end the deadly trafficking racket. And none are genuine refugees — or they would stay put in the EU which, as tearful Europhiles will tell you, is a welcoming, safe, liberal paradise.Britain must continue to rescue real refugees from warzone camps.Economic migrants from the EU, like everywhere , can come in on merit.THE Government is right to condemn America over Harry Dunn.It is taking our special relationship for granted.It tries to bully us over taxes on its tech giants, issues threats over Huawei and outrageously hides a death crash driver. Britain is right to push back.The US insists Anne Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity. But it could rescind that. It simply refuses.President Trump presumably thinks he must side with US citizens come what may. But most of them also believe Mrs Sacoolas should face justice.She won’tvoluntarily. She doesn’t want to — and says a potential jail term wouldn’t be “proportional”.That is for a judge to decide. Mrs Sacoolas’s apparent negligence killed a young man. Even accidents have consequences.If she or Trump have any sense of right and wrong, she will be flown back.THE historic Brexit Bill is signed off. In less than a week we will be out.It is an extraordinary achievement by Boris Johnson and his team, though trade talks will still be challenging.One thing bothers us. Why does the EU still let Michel Barnier run the show His error, in plotting with Remainers trying to stop us leaving, ultimately triggered the “hard Brexit” they feared.That same ill-judged pig-headedness now could jeopardise entire industries.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All good stuff.The only toxic fly in the Fair Trade, ethically sourced, organic ointment was that Charles flew to Switzerland in a private jet, emitting around six tons of carbon dioxide.There are excuses. Or,you are being generous, reasons.Charles was on his way to Israel and Palestine, where security concerns make commercial flights unviable.But after all of Charles’ fine words on climate change, the use of a private jet sent a dferent message.He was campaigning to save the planet decades before that was fashionable. But whatever the merits of his beliefs on climate change, the brutal fact is that establishment hypocrisy makes most people reach for the mute button.The nation’s honeymoon with Harry and Meghan did not end because we are racist bigots who could never accept a mixed-race woman in the Royal Family.Harry and Meghan were adored.They broke the spell when they wagged their virtuous fingers about climate change while hopping on and off private jets. It was their establishment hypocrisy that killed our love.One law for them and another for us. That makes people switch off.It isn’t complicated. You can fly by private jet OR you can lecture the world about saving the planet.But you can’t do both. Isn’t that screamingly obvious The Royal Family are not the only establishment hypocrites. Labour’s Emily Thornberry — Lady Nugee, a champion of the working man — thinks we should all send our children to the local comprehensive school.Even though, Lady Nugee confessed to Andrew Neil, that’s not what she chose for her own children.Establishment hypocrite.Harry and Meghan abandoned this country claiming they long for “financial independence”. Yet the millionaire couple always seem quite content to have some poor sucker sponsoring their lavish lestyle.There is no way Canadians will foot the bill for Harry and Meghan’s security.It is not politically possible for any Canadian PM to foist that expense on to their taxpayers.Ex-Mountie Larry Busch, who in the past has protected the royals in Canada, predicts the job will take  full-time officers and cost in excess of £.million a year.Who is going to pay for that  The “financially independent” Harry and Meghan  No chance.I can see it now. Mounties will do the heavy lting and British taxpayers will get the bill. THAT is why we went right off Harry and Meghan — their rank establishment hypocrisy.We have been endlessly told Harry and Meghan plan to refund us for the eye-watering £.million it cost to do up Frogmore Cottage, the beautul home in Windsor they no longer need or want.A refund I will believe it when I see it.Can we get a receipt THE Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Bill received Royal Assent from the Queen on Thursday. After all the years of pain and paralysis, it was finally official.The UK is leaving the European Union.Yet this historic moment did not even warrant a mention on the BBC’s Six O’Clock News.Incredible.And conclusive proof that the BBC no longer speaks for the nation.So the new Director-General of the Beeb has an existential problem.Because everyone at the corporation voted Remain, the largest vote for anything in our history – leaving the EU – has been treated as the ignorant spasm of .million uneducated, racist bigots.From crappy little comedy- shows to prestige news and current affairs, the BBC has been unapologetically biased against Brexit.The state broadcaster should be scrupulously neutral.In recent years, the BBC has been brazenly partisan.Look, we all have fond memories of growing up with the BBC. But this week I watched football on Sky and BT, drama on Amazon Prime and Netflix.None of the sport and drama I craved was on the BBC.Feeling nostalgic for Top Of The Pops and Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads  is not worth £. a year.The BBC is nakedly biased. And the BBC is increasingly irrelevant.

She gives her take on how an inability to retain independence left Meghan feeling vulnerable.Jo also reveals how free-spirited Meghan was not always able to make the compromises necessary to accept the constraints of royal le and analyses the “boyfriend shirt” she wore when first dating Harry . . . plus the Hamsa ring she put on to ward off evil.I ALWAYS feel deeply unsettled when my own feelings of love, goodwill and optimism are turned on a sixpence in exchange for scepticism, cynicism and disappointment.It indicates very strongly that I feel cheated and, perhaps worst of all, fooled.It is no exaggeration to say that this has been the personal rollercoaster of emotions I have been on with Meghan and Harry.I vividly remember standing in my garden that sweltering day during May , looking through the living-room window to watch their royal weddingand welling up with the emotion and promise of it all.Strangely, I don’t recall experiencing the same when William and Kate married seven years earlier, but there was something truly signicant about Meghan joining The Firm.She signied new, fresh, modern, showbizzy blood — and abundant, gracious, progressive attitudes.Above all , the love they had for each other was palpable.Perhaps I should already have been exercising some caution with my enthusiasm when Harry fired warning shots across the media about the treatment of his girlfriend and the supposed racist undertones.But I, for one, felt utterly encouraged and buoyant about this woman’s humility, dignity, compassion and empathy.What could possibly go wrong Now,  months down the line, I cannot deny I feel hoodwinked — and can well imagine that is how much of the population feels.As a nation of welcoming Brits , it is like we invited Meghan into our adorable, unpretentious and homely BB. She stayed for dinner, took the complimentary soaps and shampoos then walked out in search of the nearest hotel.Regardless of how they want to dress it up, the two of them have turned their backs on the UK and it feels like a kick in the teeth.What really stings is that it does not feel like it was a long-term plan, but it simply came about when Meghan re-read the membership rules, months after signing on the dotted line, and decided it cramped her style. I’m pretty certain all the statutes will have been made clear to her from the start, many times over. Everything will have been scrutinised and pored over in minute detail. The Royal Family is a watertight institution, after all.But propelled by her personal ambition, and presumably a wilfulness to reform the family, becoming a royal would not only give her a  for her humanitarian work but also fame on a level she would have been unlikely to have otherwise ever achieved.What she could not cope with was her loss of control and the fact that being part of a team inevitably means diminished autonomy.But some of her story has echoes of when Sarah Ferguson joined the family back in the Eighties.Fergie was a jolly, fun, self-deprecating young woman who thought she would have the ride of a letime. But she found herself profoundly restricted by her mother-in-law’s budget and her husband’s dullness. Instead of making a dignied exit, she had her toes sucked by another man because le was not as much fun as it had promised to be. It was ugly.The prospect of joining the Royal Family would fill me with horror — and it did so even way back in , when I was pictured alongside HRH Prince Edward at the theatre.I had become good friends with his best friend, James Baker.One night I joined James, Edward and another of his friends to go to the theatre.By sheer coincidence I was “papped” next to the prince.Excited and furious speculation ensued the following day about the mystery Swedish blonde — I was  and not yet on the ladder of fame — and I was quickly dubbed his latest flame. One newspaper even ran the headline “The Prince And The Showgirl” with old photos of me in school drama productions.It was my first experience of such widespread exposure and it came as an absolute shock.HRH was kind enough to phone me to offer his support and urge me to “say nothing”, which I duly did.After some months, the two of us did have a few dates, and while I, a most common commoner, would never have been considered “royal material”, le in The Firm crossed my mind on a few occasions.And it did not especially fill me with joy.I got the strong impression Prince Edward himself would have given anything to get in a car and drive away from it all, which was hardly the greatest endorsement. But despite getting a lot of flak over preceding years for dropping out of the Marines and then pursuing a career in the arts, the prospect of him walking away would never have been one he would have seriously entertained.His sense of duty, loyalty and obligation was too great.I really got a good insight into the restrictive le he led, along with his lack of access to any kind of normality.All the while he was surrounded by rules and traditions, and then there are the courtiers and staff, there to stle and control your many moves, constantly keeping your behaviour in check.I would go to dinner and bring my own bottle of white wine because budget and taste would have dictated a ghastly bottle of Liebfraumilch or some other type of sweet white wine, and thus a less fun evening.Because despite the Royal Family being an international brand, it seemed at the time, at least, that “taste” as such had somehow eluded Prince Edward.He was stuck with whatever the butler would bring and I am guessing money spent on wine was not considered money well spent.The foodwas decidedly plain and a tad dull.Everything in his apartment was so staid and old-fashioned.Nothing had been redecorated for decades and the bathroom had a very quaint old toilet.In my naivety, I had foolishly thought the royals would have the absolute latest in fashion and interiors, but it was like stepping back in time.Perhaps this was how Meghan experienced things, too, but with thoughts and attitudes. I would swear and push the boundaries because I felt it might amuse and maybe inspire more than a touch of reality and authenticity.But the thought of a loon like me being shackled to his le was enough to make me want to run for the hills — regardless of the universal fame that might have been waiting.The idea of a woman as fiercely independent as Meghan being defined and tethered by such an exclusive, traditional club seems, with hindsight, utterly impossible.Her initial sense of goodwill and charitable ambition appears to have been overtaken by her refusal to accept any opinion or critique.I am afraid I know to great personal cost that the limelight can be blinding.But it is a deal you make with yourself and, in her case, it was a deal she made with the British public — to serve.It is not asshe has given it her best shot for seven years and can no longer hack it.This self-defeating move away reeks of impatience, petulance and bitterness.Put simply, her new le became burdensome and an inconvenience when she discovered she could not run her own show.Her father, like mine — who opened his doors to the media when I was photographed next to Prince Edward — became a thorn in her side and she had no tools with which to deal with him.He became an embarrassment a mistake and a mess she could easily have dealt with but felt it more important to proceed with her new le and leave him behind. And then there is Harry: A man smitten and obsessed, a man who has been waiting for a Meghan all his le, someone to nurture him.He has sacriced everything for his we, willingly.He has given up all that he has ever known and everyone he holds dear to chance it all thousands of miles away, isolating himself in pursuit of a le that is not only unclear but precarious.There is no doubt that the Royal Family needs reduction and considerable reform to reflect modern times.But the thought that a newcomer might consider herself best positioned to be that subversive influence would be laughableit was not so hurtful and insulting to much of this country that has been so supportive of this historical institution. The noises from Team Sussex have been distracting, persistent and problematic because the le of a royal is, I am afraid, to toe the line.There is no halfway house, no part-time royalty — the job is not part of the gig economy.By trying to carve out a more contented, niche le for themselves, the Sussexes have made survival considerably more complicated with absolute exposure guaranteed and a letime’s guarantee of judgment and critique.I cannot be the only one who feels painfully disappointed and cheated, beguiled by Hollywood stardust and  promises.And now we are left wondering what the whole shebang was all about, becauseHarry and Meghan thought exiting was challenging, when this all ends in tears — as I fear it will — coming back to the fold will be utterly inconceivable.I DO believe that Meghan married Harry with good intentions and had every belief she could make a positive contribution to the Royal Family.I can also see how Harry, a vulnerable young man who lost his beloved mother at such an early age, could fall in love with a strong, independent woman who could provide some direction.What I do not think Meghan was prepared for was the pressure of doing everything by the book and having to follow so many rules once she had entered into the so-called Firm.The former actress was the first senior royal to have come from a background where she had already established her own successful career.She is an ambitious and determined woman who is not afraid to speak her mind and wants to do things her own way.Meghan is certainly assertive. She is determined in the face of adversity but is also vulnerable and perhaps not as tough as she likes to make out.It is also clear that she became deeply unhappy with royal le and her inability to retain her independence.During all that turmoil, Meghan was not able to publicly speak out about her feelings, so would send subtle messages.She would express how she felt through her jewellery, such as the butterfly earrings she wore shortly after her pregnancy was announced, which symbolised lightness against tension and the sense of hope and endurance.She was also seen wearing a Hamsa ring, used to ward off evil, while in the Canadian embassy. It was the day before the bombshell announcement that they were moving abroad.She often handled her pregnancy bump, wanting consciously or otherwise to draw attention to her developing baby and what it represented moving forward — her new future and family.There is no doubt in my mind that as much as Meghan adores Harry, she had a clear focus in mind from the moment they began to have feelings for each other. There were no coy hints or suggestions from her, as there were with Kate.Nor was she prepared to play the waiting game, hanging on in there until Harry was ready to propose.From the white “boyfriend shirt” she wore right at the beginning of their relationship to the way she looked at Harry and touched him, even in public, Meghan did not shy away from being loud and proud about where she wanted things to head.I think this behaviour stems from a stubborn insecurity that will not go away, and Meghan is not good with situations that are out of her control.Perhaps her coping mechanisms are not as strong as she thought. Maybe she is so determined her family will not suffer like she has in the past that she has become super-protective and frustrated at times.Meghan has had to battle a fair amount of adversity in her le, even before she met Harry.This includes a dficult, and now estranged, relationship with her father and half-sibling, with whom she no longer speaks.I do wonder why she seems to be cut off from her close childhood friends. And why do some of Harry’s oldest pals feel they have been discarded as a result of his relationship with Meghan She is a strong influence on Harry, undoubtedly.Meghan would probably admit that she is strong-willed, not always able to make the sacrices or compromises which are necessary to accept criticism or interference from the Royal Family.Perhaps there is a touch of the narcissist about her, putting her own feelings ahead of the dutul le she signed up to.For example, she seems to find it dficult to understand what her father has been going through or see his perspective.Also, when she told the ITV documentary crew, “It’s not enough to just survive something”, before adding, “You have to thrive”, that shows how important her own happiness and wellbeing is to her.But many strong and influential people have that narcissistic streak. They find it hard to tolerate a situation that makes them feel distressed or to manage a situation over which they have little control.What is interesting is that, following the move to North America, Meghan and Harry have effectively swapped roles.Instead of Meghan being the royal princess at Harry’s side, he will now be more at her behest, having to adapt to a totally dferent sort of le, and one that he could never have imagined.He might feel some resentment in due course, or he may adapt like a duck to water.Will their marriage last They have a tough journey ahead, but I hope so and I wish them well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I fell in love with you, Bryant wrote of basketball in a poem in .When the youngster was six, his dad, then retired from the NBA, was offered the chance to play in Italy and the family moved there, living in Rieti and, later, Reggio Emilia.This charming, small town would capture the young Bryants heart.Kobe Bryant grew up here and was, for all of us, a ‘Reggiano,’” the mayor of Reggio Emilia, Luca Vecchi, wrote on Facebook, following yesterdays tragedy in Calabasas.“Today he left us - a basketball legend that the whole town will remember forever with affection and respect.”Despite also taking up football, Bryant - who learned to speak Italian fluently during his time overseas - remained in love with basketball and wouldto America during the summers to compete.And when his family later moved back to Philadelphia, he stunned on the court at Lower Merion High School, becoming a national star before jumping straight to the NBA Draft aged just .This was a brave move: instead of developing his game at NCAAlevel, Bryant believed in himself and his ability enough to skip college.And it would prove to be a rewarding choice.Aged , Bryant - who had no qualms about challenging his veteran teammates despite his age - became the youngest NBA starter ever .The player would go on to win a string of NBA championships, an MVP and  All-Star selections - while showing admirable loyalty to the team he adored so much as a child.In a sport where players are regularly traded - or opt to enter free agency to earn a few extra million dollars - he stuck around at the Lakers for his entire -year career.Bryant, nicknamed Black Mamba, also displayed an amazing work ethic, even refusing to leave the court after tearing his Achilles heel during a  game so he could take two free throws.I remember one thing he said: If you want to be great at it, or want to be one of the greats, youve got to put the work in, fellow Lakers legend LeBron James told reporters.Alongside Shaquille ONeal, Bryant helped the Lakers win three NBA championships in a row between  and  - a feat that has not been matched since. He became a global icon - including in China, where basketball rivals football as the most popular sport.But alongside Bryants success came scandal: in , he was fined ,after he was caught on camera using a homophobic slur against the referee during an NBA game.Footage showed him apparently mouthing the word fa****. He later apologised for his remark, saying he made it out of frustration in the heat of the game, the BBC reported.The NBA deemed Bryants comment offensive and inexcusable - yet just two years later, the star was widely praised for hitting out at a fan for using the term gay as an insult.Just letting you know... that using your gay as a way to put someone down aint ok! #notcool delete that out ur vocab, Bryant tweeted to the fan at the time.Before leaving school to join the NBA, Bryant took RB singer Brandy to senior prom. He reportedly treated her like a queen and even flew her mum out with her.But it was at age  that he met the love of his le Vanessa, then a -year-old backing dancer in a Tha Eastsidaz music video, while working on his own album that was never released.After Bryant asked Vanessa for her number, they enjoyed a whirlwind romance - getting engaged in May , just six months after they met and while Vanessa was still in secondary school.The following year, in April , they tied the knot at a Catholic church in Calornia. However, much of Bryants family refused to attend because they disapproved of the match.Despite his relatives fears, the couple stayed together until Bryants death - with the NBA star praising Vanessa as his love and best friend in an Instagram post on their anniversary.But he also admitted they had faced ups and downs during their romance.In , Bryant was accused of sexual assault by a -year-old hotel worker in Colorado.He admitted cheating on his we, but denied the attack, claiming the sex was consensual.Prosecutors later dropped the charges against Bryant after the accuser refused to testy - and he reportedly gted Vanessa a millioneight-carat purple diamond ring as an apology.Speaking through tears at a press conference, he told his then-we of two years: Youre my backbone. Youre a blessing. Youre a piece of my heart. Youre the air I breathe.Despite being dropped by big sponsors, Bryant managed to revive his reputation and his marriage.Yet in , he was linked to playboy model Jessica Burciaga and Keeping Up With The Kardashians producer Carla DiBello - who both denied affairs with the player.The same year, Vanessa filed for orce, citing irreconcilable dferences amid her husbands alleged serial infidelity.

This has been an astonishing abuse of the court and judicial process.Mr Brown has deliberately used these proceedings to bring improper and abusive claims and to launder defamatory allegations in order to elicit vast sums of money. Mr Brown did not attend the hearing today after accusing several members of the court staff of discrimination, bullying and conspiracy.Nick Candy now looks forward to recovering all costs associated with defending this claim from Mr Brown and will commence bankruptcy proceedings against himrequired.It was revealed in October that the penthouse had become Britains most expensive home after being remortgaged using an £million loan by Mr Candy.Mr Candy had lived at the house with his we the singer and actress Holly Valance, but the pair have now moved a few streets away.It boasts heated marble floors and a walk-in wardrobe - as well as a -metre pool, a cinema and even a library.One Hyde Park, which overlooks Londons Knightsbridge and Hyde Park, was designed by Richard Rogers at Rogers, Stirk, Harbour and Partners.It opened in  with flats and is made up of  apartments commanding a record-breaking price of up to £, per square foot.The interior was designed by Candy  Candy — the firm set up by Nick and Christian from just a £, family loan in  and now solely run by Nick.The building is guarded around the clock by SAS-trained security and serviced by an in-house maid service.Residents can also enjoy dry cleaning and room service provided by the five-star Mandarin hotel next door — and personal temperature-controlled wine store.Saunas, steam rooms, a squash court and the cinema also make up the developments unmatched leisure and entertainment facilities.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It began in the far eastback in  and since then, has spread to Italy, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa and Vietnam, where it’s presented by Hoang Rapper. Seriously.Five weeks ago the global pandemic reached Britain and those millions of us who were infected have spent an uncomfortable month trying to work outThe Masked Singer is so bad it’s good or merely so bad it’s an affront to humanity.Somewhat reluctantly, I’ve finally got to admit it’s the former, despite having more than enough self-inflicted wounds and production flaws to sink most programmes.The Masked Singer is, for starters, no sort of contest, and while some of the singers, like Chameleon Justin Hawkins, disguise their identity brilliantly, John Barrowman could no more hide his showbiz light under the Large Hadron Collider than he could a unicorn outfit.There are also issues with that hopelessly random , Jonathan, Rita, Davina McCall and Donny Osmond Ken Jeong, who are either deliberately muddying the waters or are actually thick and deluded enough to believe a Joel Dommett-fronted show might also feature “Margot Robbie”, “Ray Winstone”, “Gemma Arterton”, “Helen Mirren” and “Olivia Colman”, in fancy dress outfits.God knows, it must be hard for them to confront the idea The Masked Singer is now the biggest thing in their careers. The only people I actually feel sorry for, though, are the poor dancers who’ve suffered the torments of hell on this show.The absolute worst of which was doing the twist, wearing only towels and snorkels, while that trippy octopus thing sang Splish Splash standing up in a bath. Yet still I watch. Why  Well, I’ve no realistic choice when the alternative is as tedious as BBC’s The Greatest Dancer.But I’d also choose The Masked Singer over X Factor, The Voice UK and practically any other Saturday night alternative the two main channels have served up recently, for the simple reason the basic guessing game concept and the end-of-show reveal are infuriatingly brilliant.Indeed, I’d go so far as to say Tutankhamun removing his head to reveal former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is one of the TV highlights of the year so far. Inevitably, the overlong shows, repetitive nature of the process and relative disappointments, like discovering it was Kelis in the daisy outfit, will quickly cure me.I’m sticking with The Masked Singer for now, though, because a slightly better bet than Natalie Cole has just reared its head in the duck outfit. After several weeks insisting it was a Spice Girl, Jonathan Ross now thinks: “It could be Diane Abbott . . . ”And, you never know, she might even do her own version of a Spice Girls song,  Become . I’ve rarely wanted anything more.BEST TV hour of the past week was Channel ’s SAS: Who Dares Wins, despite the fact its contestants were only visible for about  per cent of ­Sunday night’s show.Rest of the time they were blotted out by a gigantic Atlantic p***-storm which had engulfed the beautul and brutal island of Raasay, on Scotland’s west coast, so that all you could actually see were some green blobs lumbering up and down the mountains and all you could hear was swearing, from Ant Middleton.Or Foxy. Or possibly Billy. Or maybe even Ollie. “Put the casualty on the f***ing stretcher. Grab the f***ing stretcher and f***ing get him off the f***ing hill. That’s how we f***ing do it. Now move.”A big ask, I think you’ll agree, and the only one who seemed equal to it was James, an estate agent, who’s cracked every single challenge but not a single smile since episode one.He has, however, hinted at a very dark backgroundand claimed, with an entirely straight face: “It’s dficult to sayI’m good at hiding my emotions, ’cos I don’t have many.”No sooner had he said it, though, than Ant and the boys were pressing play on a Skype message from his mum. “Hi Peanut!” At which point James turned into a blubbing, schoolboy wreck.THE burning issue and question on Channel ’s mind last night was Bring Back The Bush: Where Did Our Pubic Hair Go  Where indeed  If it isn’t exactly where you left it or down the back of the sofa.Who worse to investigate this pressing issue, then, than Chidera Eggerue, the creative force behind the “Saggy Boobs Matter” campaign, who clearly craves attention and victim status but hasn’t worked out any better way of getting them than by making a gigantic exhibition of herself.So she’d set herself a real “challenge” here. “I’m growing my pubic hair for the next six weeks.” Exactly the sort of zero-effort empty gesture millennials seem to love.Chidera wasn’t quite confident enough in the project to go it alone, though, so she’d roped in four other minge martyrs to sprout away, while she went to LA to gawp at a porn shoot and work out why it was all the fault of men and the media.With the help of some anecdotal cobblers and an old copy of Playboy, Chidera eventually established the “flawless, hairless women” era was all about blokes “policing women’s bodies”, and the only way to fight back was, as I’d feared: “By revealing our bushes to the world.”When push came to shave, though, two of her mates insisted on wearing massive pants for the climactic photoshoot, the smartest one opted out completely and Chidera herself unveiled something that could’ve been her chuff, but could just as easily have been Ben Kingsley in All Hail The King.

Instead it is because of what he says is a very basic error. It is missing an Oxford comma. The coin, which enters circulation on January , reads: Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations. An Oxford comma is used after the penultimate item in a list of three or more items, so would be placed after the word prosperity.His Dark Materials author Sir Philip wrote on Twitter that the omission meant the coin should be boycotted by all literate people.Stig Abell, the editor of the Times Literary Supplement, also condemned the coinaposs punctuation. He tweeted: Not perhaps the only objection, but the lack of a comma after aposprosperityapos is killing me. However user @TychoNestoris replied: Be gone with your American serial comma nonsense! Also known as a serial comma, the punctuation mark derives its common name from its use in by the Oxford University Press . On its use, the OUPaposs style guide states: In a list of three or more items, insert a comma before the aposandapos or aposorapos. But author and economics commentator Frances Coppola said the punctuation was not essential for the new p. Responding to Sir Philip, she tweeted: As all literate people know, the Oxford comma is entirely optional. But it offends both in its presence and its absence.  Whatever the choice, someone will think it wrong. There could not be a better commemoration of Brexit. Sir Philip noted the debate was not a matter of grammar but orthography, the conventions of language. About three million Brexit coins will enter circulation around the UK from Friday, with a further seven million to be added later in the year.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is likely to receive one of the first coins later this week, his official spokesman said.The spokesman told reporters Iaposm sure he would wish to keep one as a souvenir.

It has also given paid employment to sellers of flags, and to YouTubing oddballs who would otherwise have to prank-call the police for attention. A brief look out of the window may not reveal a single change since the date of the referendum on June , . There are no fresh mass graves, no armed civilian militia, nor the toilet roll shortage we were told would arrive at the same time as chronic diarrhoea from unpuried drinking water. But then, Brexit has not happened yet. Nor will it happen at pm this Friday. All that will occur on that date is the equivalent of Harry and Meghan boarding a plane to Toronto - a decision has been made, then confirmed by a smaller number of people, and now the real headache begins.It is not possible, though, for nothing to happen for , days. Some things have changed already, permanently, and mostly for the better. For example: . Every pub contains a constitutional expert  It is no longer possible to state loudly, and in public, an opinion about the legally-binding nature of international treaties, the sovereignty of Parliament, or the validity of a Supreme Court decision, without at least  person, possibly , expressing an alternative view while quoting -year-old case law to back it up.Should you wish to have a debate about whether the role of Members of Parliament is to be representatives or delegates, the best place to do it is now the Royal Oak, or perhaps the work canteen. It used to be that the separation of powers was of concern only to those few who walked along their corridors. Now, this mutually-abusive ménage à trois between the executive, legislative and judiciary has been examined, argued with, and considered by millions who used to be blissfully ignorant of it.So theyaposll all appreciate the next point, which is: . The Prime Minister is not Henry VIII When Theresa May first tried to trigger Article  - months after the referendum, which was won by the side that promised it would not do it for  YEARS - she did so using her powers under the Royal Prerogative. Several people raised their eyebrows about the ancient right of the sovereign being used to arbitrarily leave an international treaty in a way no-one had voted for, and one in particular led a campaign to ensure Theresa stay in her democratic lane.Gina Miller was subject to death threats, intense abuse, and flat lies from a government made to look foolish. Others who supported her cases were not. But her court actions ensured our unwritten constitution was safeguarded, Theresa was told she was not allowed to be a tyrant, and an argument about Royal power which we all thought ended when Charles I had his head lopped off was settled for a second time in a far less bloody fashion.A win for Brexiters, Remainers, Roundheads and Cavaliers. And so is the fact that: . Nigel Farage is unemployed  After  years on the EU gravy train, one limited company, two political parties and an untold number of resignations, the yellow-trousered tit has lost his purpose.A one-man generator of the dole queue, he has likewise removed  Brexit Party MEPs, and  of other parties, from the European Parliament, and dumped financial responsibility for them on others. Heaposs considered by the current government not a fit and proper person for the House of Lords, and during the referendum proved electoral kryptonite by squashing the prospective Leave vote every time he appeared in public. Nigel has vowed not to take his EU severance pay and pension, but then he does have a nice berth on LBC, regular spots on Fox News, and a friend in the White House. The delicious question, though, is how long any of that will last after Nigelaposs lost his point. Because: . This is Boris Johnsonaposs problem, now  Brexit is Borisapos baby. It happened only because he aligned himself to it, resigned from the first government committed to it, then blithely promised all sorts of unicorns to become PM.He has proven himself able to get elected while being widely disbelieved, but having already experienced Commons defeats despite a walloping majority it is unclear what will happenthe Brexit he promised - a healthier NHS, friendlier EU, and actual jam on your carefully-protected rights - does not materialise. Heaposll probably blame someone , talk about having to be practical and end up signing off on a deal worse than the last one. Oh, wait, heaposs done that already. Well, perhaps heaposll get Carrie pregnant and hope no-one asks him whether this is number  or . And his biggest problem has gone, as: . Northern Ireland will probably be fine  Fears of a renewed barbed-wire border, of border guards intimidated, bribed, beaten or murdered, of the Army deployed once more to keep order, and fresh terrorist bombing campaigns have been allayed.Thataposs because the Good Friday Agreement, which allowed Northern Irish citizens to live in peace and self-identy as British or Irish, has been effectively replaced by a Withdrawal Agreement which says in not so many words that theyaposre all Irish now.Thereaposs no border. No requirement for number plate recognition cameras to bend space and time, or border guards to illegally spy on what lorries in other countries are up to. And thereaposs no need for the IRA to get its knickers in a twist. The Loyalist terror groups might, but so what because: . Jeremy Corbyn might have finally won something  For decades as a trouble-making backbencher, Corbyn campaigned for a united Ireland. He voted against the  Anglo-Irish agreement, called for independence and reconciliation, and as leader of the Labour Party his spokesman said he thought reunication had majority support.It didnapost, when he said that. But since then two polls have found Northern Ireland is slightly in favour of rejoining the Republic from which it split in . The problem with an invisible border is that the bleedinapos obvious one in the Irish Sea would become more of an issue."},{"url":null,"title":"harry dunns mum urges pm","story":"w.mantis The grieving mother of a British teenager killed in a crash urged Boris Johnson to “make the country proud of you” by bringing back to the UK the American woman accused of her son’s death. n The Prime Minister was urged to press Donald Trump to extradite US citizen Anne Sacoolas, who was said to be driving on the wrong side of the road when she collided with Harry Dunn’s motorbike outside an RAF base in Northants. nMr Johnson’s spokesman said failing toSacoolas was a “denial of justice”.  nThe PM is expected to hold talks with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is London, later this week - and faces pressure to raise the case with the White House diplomat.  nFollowing Mr Johnson’s spokesman’s comments, Harry’s mum Charlotte Charles said: “There are a lot of people out there who don’t necessarily have faith in this Government and this is a chance for him to restore a bit of that faith.  n  n Boris Johnson to decide on Huaweiaposs involvement in G phone network tomorrow n Brexit Big Ben bong fundraiser gives up and says it will donate cash raised to veterans  n“It’s certainly another step forward but until I see action, they are not empty words, but they are words that need action behind them to show us that they are % going to stand up for us.”  nShe added: “He needs to use his power, because he’s the only person with the power to tell Trump and Pompeo that she needs to come back.  n“It feels good that he’s on the same page as us and this is certainly a step in the right direction.”  nMrs Sacoolas, , claimed diplomatic immunity following the smash in August and was able toto her home country, sparking an international controversy.  n  n Single mum takes DWP to High Court after Universal Credit hurled her into childcare debt  nThe US has refused to extradite her.  n Harry’s parents met Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab at the Foreign Office. nSpeaking after the meeting, the family’s spokesman said: “We wanted to look at the Foreign Secretary’s eyes and make it absolutely clear we were not going to accept Harry being swept under the carpet.  n“The parents and I are absolutely clear that that is not the case and the Foreign Secretary is every bit as angry as the parents are and frankly the whole nation now and they are not going to take this lying down.”  nLatest UK politics news  n   nStressing they “will not rest,” he added: “It’s about making sure this will never happen to another family ever again.”  nThe spokesman said they are “satisfied” that the Foreign Secretary is “batting” for Harry.  nHe added: “We have no worries or concerns that this is going to be swept under the carpet.  n“There is a special relationship here.

The Prime Minister was urged to press Donald Trump to extradite US citizen Anne Sacoolas, who was said to be driving on the wrong side of the road when she collided with Harry Dunn’s motorbike outside an RAF base in Northants.Mr Johnson’s spokesman said failing toSacoolas was a “denial of justice”. The PM is expected to hold talks with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is London, later this week - and faces pressure to raise the case with the White House diplomat. Following Mr Johnson’s spokesman’s comments, Harry’s mum Charlotte Charles said: “There are a lot of people out there who don’t necessarily have faith in this Government and this is a chance for him to restore a bit of that faith. “It’s certainly another step forward but until I see action, they are not empty words, but they are words that need action behind them to show us that they are % going to stand up for us.” She added: “He needs to use his power, because he’s the only person with the power to tell Trump and Pompeo that she needs to come back. “It feels good that he’s on the same page as us and this is certainly a step in the right direction.” Mrs Sacoolas, , claimed diplomatic immunity following the smash in August and was able toto her home country, sparking an international controversy.  The US has refused to extradite her.Harry’s parents met Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab at the Foreign Office.Speaking after the meeting, the family’s spokesman said: “We wanted to look at the Foreign Secretary’s eyes and make it absolutely clear we were not going to accept Harry being swept under the carpet. “The parents and I are absolutely clear that that is not the case and the Foreign Secretary is every bit as angry as the parents are and frankly the whole nation now and they are not going to take this lying down.” "},{"url":null,"title":"single mum takes dwp high","story":"w.mantis A single mum is taking the DWP to the High Court over Universal Credit childcare rules that forced her into debt. nNichola Salvato - a professional benefits advisor - could help up to half a million parents on the six-in-one benefitshe wins her landmark legal fight.  nShe is asking for a judicial review of rules that force UC claimants to pay up-front for childcare.  nParents on UC can get up to £ per month for each child under  to fund % of their childcare costs.

The fast food giant said it had taken the measure after a member of staff was attacked at a branch in Chelmsley Wood in Solihull. Employees there are safeguarded by rows of metal, reportedly to stop intruders getting behind the counter, Birmingham Live reports. There are gaps big enough for a family chicken bucket to pass - but is small enough to protect staff from any potential threat. The fixtures - secured by chunky metal bars bolted from the counter to the ceilings - were introduced after fighting and an incident involving a worker, Birmingham Live was told. A girl reportedly jumped over the counter and struck a staff member in the kitchen, a manager at the branch said.Tell us about your terrible experiences in takeaways - email webnews@mirrorOne customer visiting the store on Sunday said: Iaposm not surprised theyaposve resorted to this. Itaposs moody as anything. Iaposll only come in the daytime as it is all gangs of teenagers come the evenings, its like they have nothing better to do. Its always kicking off around here. It looks like chicken wire, which is ironic. Itaposs unsightly too, its has an airport security feel about it. Another customer, Joanne Marshall, , a college student, said: I donapost feel unsafe here as thereaposs security staff here but its a bit unnerving to see security barriers at a KFC. Itaposs a sign of the times I suppose.  When asked about the security measures at the branch, one staff member said: Weaposve had a few problems with fights so its for our safety. One of our girls was attacked, people have jumped over the counter before. Itaposs fine most of the time but weaposve had a few issues, shall we say. Other residents reacted on social media with Graham Bassett saying: We are now living in a violent society were there is no respect for anything and any body. Debbie Riley put on Facebook: Donapost blame them I saw a really nasty situation safety for the staff. Shakil Mohammed added: So kfc is serving chicken through chicken wire.  Dan Moore said: Itaposs the roughest KFC in and around Brum without doubt. Seen loads of trouble in there. A spokeswoman for KFC said: Something happened a few months ago.Itaposs for our safety, a few months ago a girl jumped over and hit one of the staff members. So they just put it up for safety. It was put up in August. When quizzed over the fixture, another staff member added: Itaposs for our safety because of the fights. Thereaposs been fights happening yeah. Several Midland fast-food restaurants have taken extra security measures to protect staff and customers from yobs in recent years.

South London-born Omari was just eight when he started his own business, Dipalicious, selling vegan dips and snacks. It isn’t just his first steps towards an empire that are so uplting. It is also the magnicent way in which he represents himself. While so many exasperated parents are forced to switch off the wi-fi or confiscate Xboxes or PSs, Omari can be found in the kitchen, educating himself. “I’ve got dyslexia so I find it dficult to read food labels,” he said. “Sometimes I smell the ingredients before I know what they are. When I was learning to read, I used cookbooks to help me remember words.” At a time when so much about our kids these days is negative, Omari and his response to adversity are a breath of fresh air. “I was beaten up at school by a boy in Year ,” he said.

They are innocent and although Lee never played an active part in their lives after he chose drugs instead, the children still have to process the death of their father. The mother is doing her utmost to console and guide them through this tragedy, she said.

In biting comments, Mr Millet described how he had asked in phase one there be no “buck passing” but that his request had fallen on deaf ears. He said the firms had taken the approach that “what happened was somebody ’s fault”. Mr Millet said those affected are “owed at the very least an honest and a complete account from witnesses who are in a position to explain why it happened.” Afterwards, Prashant Popat, counsel for architects Studio E, claimed the firm acted “as would be expected of a reasonably competent architect in its position”, adding it had no idea products on the tower were unsafe.

Then, finding out she was a little girl, too - we felt so grateful.  nShe was a chunky little thing and we all fell in love with her instantly.  n  n Mum of baby boy born with misshapen skull shares heartwarming first year n Nurseaposs devastating words to mum after she begged doctors not to send dying baby home   nFamily le was great until Penny developed a snotty nose at six months old, which numerous courses of antibiotics failed to clear.  nKelly, from Stoke-On-Trent, said: We weren’t too worried as babies do get infections at that age, but it was like a consistent green stream coming from her nose,” Kelly continued.  nAs she got older, she wasn’t saying many words and was a late crawler, but we thought she was just a bit lazy, as we all fussed around her.  nDespite developing slowly, little Penny could say her big brother Harryaposs name by the time she was  months old.  nAged two, Penny was still struggling with potty training. nKelly said: With everything, we hoped there was a simple reason, but, deep down, Andrew and I suspected something more was going on,” said Kelly.  nShe behaved dferently to other children her age. She didn’t look like me or Andrew, or the boys either. There were only a few facial similarities.  n  n Mumaposs birth selfie from delivery room has people cracking up - thanks to husband n Woman told as teenager she would never have kids now has whopping brood of ten   nIt was after a family trip to a holiday camp in Cornwall, when Penny was two and struggled to communicate and play that she was referred to children’s services.  nShe was assessed for learning disabilities, including autism, which were ruled out.  nAs her hearing was also weak, when Penny was three, she was fitted with hearing aids which seemed to help.  nAnd by the time she was four, she knew  words and could chatter away to her family, which also includes big brother, Tyler, .  nBut there were still issues and with no diagnosis Penny was sent for genetic testing, in September , when she was four.  nShe was diagnosed with Sanfilippo syndrome, which is childhood dementia and means she wonapost live past her teens.  nKelly said: It was a complete shock. They said it was a rare condition and gave me a leaflet about it.  nThe first thing I saw was ‘palliative care’. We thought it would be le-limiting, but had no idea it was terminal. We were devastated.  n  n Mum, , diagnosed with cancer after missing smear tests gives birth to miracle twins n Toddler brothers try to wake up mum, , after she collapses and dies at home   nI walked Penny into school that day and broke down in tears.  nThe average le expectancy is , but there’s quite a big range. Some children die much younger and there are some young adults with Sanfilippo.  nWe just take each day as it comes. We’ve learned over the last five or six years that nothing’s guaranteed in le.  n nNow the rare genetic disease, which causes fatal brain damage, has started its deadly assault and will eventually mean she forgets how to speak, swallow and walk.  n n n n n n nAffecting one in , UK births, it is dubbed ‘childhood dementia,’ as it can cause severe degenerative neurological deterioration and progressive physical disability.  nKelly, who has also been supported by the Donna Louise Hospice in Stoke-on-Trent, continued, explained: There are three stages to the disease. nFirst comes delayed learning. The second stage, which we’re in now, is the hyperactivity stage, so she is often awake for three or four hours a night.  n  n Brain-damaged baby boy aposhas diedapos - but parents still want him on le support n aposHeart transplant saved me from certain death - then my fiancée died  hours before we were to marryapos   nThe third stage is when sufferers really start to slow down. It is dferent for every child, but she will start to lose mobility and will eventually forget how to swallow, so will need a feeding tube.  nIt’s like we are grieving for our little girl, as we watch this cruel disease rob her of everything she knows.  nAnd when little Penny started to lose her vocabulary, forgetting words she had once known like cheese, chocolate and biscuits, and her brothers’ names, the family were devastated.  nAround the same time she also stopped using a fork and started eating with her hands.  nHer vocabulary has now virtually disappeared – going from  words when she was four to around  now. nShe still says ‘dada’ and ‘dance,’ over and over, but out of context.  nKelly said: She used to say ‘mummy,’ but I can’t remember the last time I heard her say it.  nShe has forgotten how to use toys, like a piggy bank, and puzzle games where you match things and she can’t put her socks and shoes on anymore.  nShe just looks confused. We show her how to do it over and over. Sometimes she will get it but we never knowshe will be able to do it again tomorrow.  n  n Paramedics rushing to choking boy at Butlinaposs aposwere blocked by bollards and gatesapos n Baby freezes to death in buggy after parents lock him on -C balcony to sleep   nShe doesn’t get frustrated, because she doesn’t really understand what we are trying to do.  nLuckily, she still recognises her parents, but they know this will not last.  nKelly said: She still lights up when she sees us, so we don’t think she has forgotten us yet, but we are prepared for that to happen. It’s one of our worst fears.  nIt does take her time to remember people she’s met before, so I have made her a book with pictures of the family in it. I sit down and go through it with her every day.  nHer brother’s away at university and we Facetime him, so she remembers him.  nPenny’s family are determined to make as many memories as they can with her.  nKelly said: When she gets to the end stage, I do not want to look back and think all I did was worry about the future.

They said it was a rare condition and gave me a leaflet about it. n \"The first thing I saw was ‘palliative care’. We thought it would be le-limiting, but had no idea it was terminal.

Her sister, Milly, was stillborn at  weeks, after mum, Kelly, suffered a placental abruption in , leaving her and dad, Andrew, devastated. But their tears turned to joy when they realised they were expecting for a second time and they welcome baby Penny the following year. Kelly, , said: That loss was devastating for the whole family. Discovering I was pregnant with Penny nine months later, I felt extremely lucky. Then, finding out she was a little girl, too - we felt so grateful. She was a chunky little thing and we all fell in love with her instantly.  Family le was great until Penny developed a snotty nose at six months old, which numerous courses of antibiotics failed to clear. Kelly, from Stoke-On-Trent, said: We weren’t too worried as babies do get infections at that age, but it was like a consistent green stream coming from her nose,” Kelly continued. As she got older, she wasn’t saying many words and was a late crawler, but we thought she was just a bit lazy, as we all fussed around her. Despite developing slowly, little Penny could say her big brother Harryaposs name by the time she was  months old. Aged two, Penny was still struggling with potty training. Kelly said: With everything, we hoped there was a simple reason, but, deep down, Andrew and I suspected something more was going on,” said Kelly. She behaved dferently to other children her age. She didn’t look like me or Andrew, or the boys either. There were only a few facial similarities. It was after a family trip to a holiday camp in Cornwall, when Penny was two and struggled to communicate and play that she was referred to children’s services. She was assessed for learning disabilities, including autism, which were ruled out. As her hearing was also weak, when Penny was three, she was fitted with hearing aids which seemed to help. And by the time she was four, she knew  words and could chatter away to her family, which also includes big brother, Tyler, . But there were still issues and with no diagnosis Penny was sent for genetic testing, in September , when she was four. She was diagnosed with Sanfilippo syndrome, which is childhood dementia and means she wonapost live past her teens. Kelly said: It was a complete shock. They said it was a rare condition and gave me a leaflet about it. The first thing I saw was ‘palliative care’. We thought it would be le-limiting, but had no idea it was terminal. We were devastated. I walked Penny into school that day and broke down in tears.  The average le expectancy is , but there’s quite a big range. Some children die much younger and there are some young adults with Sanfilippo. We just take each day as it comes. We’ve learned over the last five or six years that nothing’s guaranteed in le. Now the rare genetic disease, which causes fatal brain damage, has started its deadly assault and will eventually mean she forgets how to speak, swallow and walk.  Affecting one in , UK births, it is dubbed ‘childhood dementia,’ as it can cause severe degenerative neurological deterioration and progressive physical disability.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA touching note which read all children go straight to heaven was left where a teenage boyaposs severed head was found. Keane Mulready-Woods was brutally killed and dismembered in a war between rival gangs in Drogheda, Ireland. His limbs were dumped in a sports bag and his head was recovered separately from a burning car in Drumcondra. The note was left among floral tributes and candles, close to where the burnt out car was found. Irish police are understood to have found the bloodied machetes in a shed behind a house in Drogheda, Co. Louth, and blood-soaked floorboards inside the home. Keane, , was abducted in his native Drogheda on Sunday, January  and is believed to have been killed later that day. The Irish Independent reports the teen was stabbed multiple times before his body was dismemebered. Police are still searching for his torso. It’s understood two psychotic butchers lopped off his fingertips and thumbs before dumping his severed legs and arms on a street. Sources said this was to remove any potential DNA from the killers under his finger nails to help them evade prosecution, the Irish Mirror reported. A senior source told the paper: “This was nothing short of barbaric. A completely depraved act. “Keane’s body parts were dumped in Coolock as a message to their enemies. It’s like something out of the Netflix show Narcos.”  Detectives are checking with Keane’s family and friends from the Beechwood area of Drogheda in a bid to trace his last movements. A huge manhunt is under way for the suspects who abducted, tortured and slaughtered him. Keane’s murder, which has shocked the country and made headlines across Europe, is the third killing in the bloody feud between two gangs.

I knew he was seriously ill, but they wouldn’t listen.  n“A mother’s instinct is a very powerful one, andthey had taken notice, Mohammad would still be alive today.  n“When I called an ambulance a second time, the paramedic seemed far more interested in filling out his paperwork than he was in treating Mohammad.  n“I told him Mohammad had a rash and blue lips and he actually accused me of being dramatic.  n“By the time we arrived at hospital, I knew it was too late.  I will never forgive the staff who treated him.

Now, it feels like a dream.  n“My heart aches to hold my son again, and it gets no easier as time passes.”  nMohammad was a longed for and much-loved baby. Muna and her husband Emad had been trying for a baby for  years and she had suffered five miscarriages, before his birth in May .  nMuna says: “Mohammad was beautul. I adored him, and I was very protective of him. He was my entire world.  n“He was a contented, happy little baby and aside from some mild reflux he had no health problems.”  nMuna’s husband was working abroad and she moved with her sister, Fatmeh, a teaching assistant, and her two young daughters.  nIn September , Mohammad had been on his first ‘school run’ to take his cousins to school. He had seemed well all day until late afternoon, when he vomited violently after a feed. His temperature suddenly shot up, his lips turned blue and his mother and aunt were immediately concerned.  nHe was taken to Tameside General Hospital, Manchester, by ambulance where Muna was unable to settle him.  nShe says: “I was becoming alarmed at how distressed he was. He was burning hot, but his feet were freezing, which is a marker for meningitis, but a nurse told me just to wrap them in a blanket.  n“A doctor told me he just had a cold virus, and that he could go home. I was very polite, but I said to her: ‘I know my baby and he is not right, and I really don’t want to take him home.’  n“I asked her to check his breathing, because it seemed laboured, but she told me he was fine.  n“I was insistent but the most they would do was keep him for a further two hours. During that time nobody checked on him at all and then we were discharged.  n  n aposTradweapos who believes women should apossubmitapos to husbands and aposspoil them like itaposs apos   n“I felt absolutely helpless. I trusted the doctors, but I felt they weren’t listening to me.”  nAt home Mohammad became increasingly agitated and at am, Muna noticed a rash on her son’s stomach. She called another ambulance and the call was categorised as urgent.  nBut when paramedics arrived, they spent around  minutes in the house and a further  outside the house, before eventually taking the little boy to hospital.  nMuna says: “It was asI was wasting their time, like they didn’t believe me. I showed them the rash and they said the glass test was inconclusive.  n“I told them his lips were blue and one paramedic actually said he thought I was ‘dramatic.’  n“Outside in the ambulance he insisted on filling in paperwork, repeatedly asking me about my heritage, saying: ‘Are you black African ’  n“I was appalled. I had Mohammad on my chest, his eyes were huge and glassy, and he was covered with a rash. I couldn’t believe it was happening. They just refused to see the urgency.”  nWhen Mohammad finally reached hospital, he was rushed away by a team of medics who were unable to save him.

I knew he was seriously ill, but they wouldn’t listen. n“A mother’s instinct is a very powerful one, andthey had taken notice, Mohammad would still be alive today. n“When I called an ambulance a second time, the paramedic seemed far more interested in filling out his paperwork than he was in treating Mohammad. n“I told him Mohammad had a rash and blue lips and he actually accused me of being dramatic. n“By the time we arrived at hospital, I knew it was too late.  I will never forgive the staff who treated him. My son was just starting out in le, we had so many hopes and dreams for him, but they failed him at the time he needed them the most. n Everything we know about coronavirus - deaths, UK cases and whats being done  n“I look back on those three months of motherhood and they were so perfect, so full of joy. Now, it feels like a dream. n“My heart aches to hold my son again, and it gets no easier as time passes.” nMohammad was a longed for and much-loved baby. Muna and her husband Emad had been trying for a baby for  years and she had suffered five miscarriages, before his birth in May . nMuna says: “Mohammad was beautul. I adored him, and I was very protective of him. He was my entire world. n“He was a contented, happy little baby and aside from some mild reflux he had no health problems.” nMuna’s husband was working abroad and she moved with her sister, Fatmeh, a teaching assistant, and her two young daughters. nIn September , Mohammad had been on his first ‘school run’ to take his cousins to school. He had seemed well all day until late afternoon, when he vomited violently after a feed. His temperature suddenly shot up, his lips turned blue and his mother and aunt were immediately concerned. nHe was taken to Tameside General Hospital, Manchester, by ambulance where Muna was unable to settle him. nShe says: “I was becoming alarmed at how distressed he was. He was burning hot, but his feet were freezing, which is a marker for meningitis, but a nurse told me just to wrap them in a blanket. n“A doctor told me he just had a cold virus, and that he could go home. I was very polite, but I said to her: ‘I know my baby and he is not right, and I really don’t want to take him home.’ n“I asked her to check his breathing, because it seemed laboured, but she told me he was fine. n“I was insistent but the most they would do was keep him for a further two hours. During that time nobody checked on him at all and then we were discharged. n Tradwe who believes women should submit to husbands and spoil them like its   n“I felt absolutely helpless. I trusted the doctors, but I felt they weren’t listening to me.” nAt home Mohammad became increasingly agitated and at am, Muna noticed a rash on her son’s stomach. She called another ambulance and the call was categorised as urgent. nBut when paramedics arrived, they spent around  minutes in the house and a further  outside the house, before eventually taking the little boy to hospital. nMuna says: “It was asI was wasting their time, like they didn’t believe me. I showed them the rash and they said the glass test was inconclusive. n“I told them his lips were blue and one paramedic actually said he thought I was ‘dramatic.’ n“Outside in the ambulance he insisted on filling in paperwork, repeatedly asking me about my heritage, saying: ‘Are you black African ’ n“I was appalled. I had Mohammad on my chest, his eyes were huge and glassy, and he was covered with a rash. I couldn’t believe it was happening. They just refused to see the urgency.” nWhen Mohammad finally reached hospital, he was rushed away by a team of medics who were unable to save him. He suffered a cardiac arrest and died with Muna at his side. nMuna says: “When we arrived, one of the nurses from our earlier visit said to me: ‘This is why we should always listen to mothers. n“I told her: ‘It’s too late.’ n Inside Aaron Hernandezs cell and three handwritten notes found after his death  n“I knew in my heart that he was drting away.

Muna Aburizeq has described how she pleaded with medics to continue treating her three-month-old Mohammad Aldmour after he suddenly fell ill at home.Last week an inquest heard how she called an ambulance for her little boy but he was later discharged by doctors, despite Muna begging them to admit him. Hours later, he developed a meningitis rash and his panic-stricken mother called a second ambulance and asked them to take him back to hospital.But paramedics spent almost forty minutes at the family home. When he eventually arrived at hospital, his devastated mother told staff: ‘It is too late now.’ One of the nurses who treated Mohammad earlier in the day said: This is why we should always listen to mothers. The little boy went into cardiac arrest and died soon afterwards, with her by his side. Muna, , from Hyde, Greater Manchester, says: “I told the doctors in no uncertain terms that I did not want to take my baby home. I knew he was seriously ill, but they wouldn’t listen. “A mother’s instinct is a very powerful one, andthey had taken notice, Mohammad would still be alive today. “When I called an ambulance a second time, the paramedic seemed far more interested in filling out his paperwork than he was in treating Mohammad. “I told him Mohammad had a rash and blue lips and he actually accused me of being dramatic. “By the time we arrived at hospital, I knew it was too late.  I will never forgive the staff who treated him. My son was just starting out in le, we had so many hopes and dreams for him, but they failed him at the time he needed them the most.  “I look back on those three months of motherhood and they were so perfect, so full of joy. Now, it feels like a dream. “My heart aches to hold my son again, and it gets no easier as time passes.” Mohammad was a longed for and much-loved baby. Muna and her husband Emad had been trying for a baby for  years and she had suffered five miscarriages, before his birth in May . Muna says: “Mohammad was beautul. I adored him, and I was very protective of him. He was my entire world. “He was a contented, happy little baby and aside from some mild reflux he had no health problems.” Muna’s husband was working abroad and she moved with her sister, Fatmeh, a teaching assistant, and her two young daughters. In September , Mohammad had been on his first ‘school run’ to take his cousins to school. He had seemed well all day until late afternoon, when he vomited violently after a feed. His temperature suddenly shot up, his lips turned blue and his mother and aunt were immediately concerned.  He was taken to Tameside General Hospital, Manchester, by ambulance where Muna was unable to settle him. She says: “I was becoming alarmed at how distressed he was. He was burning hot, but his feet were freezing, which is a marker for meningitis, but a nurse told me just to wrap them in a blanket. “A doctor told me he just had a cold virus, and that he could go home. I was very polite, but I said to her: ‘I know my baby and he is not right, and I really don’t want to take him home.’ “I asked her to check his breathing, because it seemed laboured, but she told me he was fine. “I was insistent but the most they would do was keep him for a further two hours. During that time nobody checked on him at all and then we were discharged.  “I felt absolutely helpless. I trusted the doctors, but I felt they weren’t listening to me.” At home Mohammad became increasingly agitated and at am, Muna noticed a rash on her son’s stomach. She called another ambulance and the call was categorised as urgent. But when paramedics arrived, they spent around  minutes in the house and a further  outside the house, before eventually taking the little boy to hospital. Muna says: “It was asI was wasting their time, like they didn’t believe me. I showed them the rash and they said the glass test was inconclusive. “I told them his lips were blue and one paramedic actually said he thought I was ‘dramatic.’ “Outside in the ambulance he insisted on filling in paperwork, repeatedly asking me about my heritage, saying: ‘Are you black African ’ “I was appalled. I had Mohammad on my chest, his eyes were huge and glassy, and he was covered with a rash. I couldn’t believe it was happening. They just refused to see the urgency.” When Mohammad finally reached hospital, he was rushed away by a team of medics who were unable to save him. He suffered a cardiac arrest and died with Muna at his side.  Muna says: “When we arrived, one of the nurses from our earlier visit said to me: ‘This is why we should always listen to mothers. “I told her: ‘It’s too late.’ “I knew in my heart that he was drting away. He opened his eyes one last time as the doctors tried to get anti-biotics into him, and then he died. “I felt such a pain in my heart as he passed away. It felt my whole world went dark. I felt so guilty afterwards, that I should have been able to look after him, as his mother, yet I know I could not have done more.” Mohammad’s family struggled to cope with their loss and Muna, a care worker, suffered a breakdown. At an inquest into Mohammad’s death, held last week at South Manchester Coroner’s Court, a jury concluded there was a ‘gross failure’ by Tameside General Hospital. According to the hospital’s own policy and national guidelines, three from five readings taken from the little boy should have triggered the sepsis pathway.The coroner, Alison Mutch, recorded a conclusion that the baby died of natural causes contributed to by neglect, and the jury unanimously agreed that a number of failings during the first visit to hospital had contributed to Mohammad’s death. Ms Mutch also acknowledged a series of failings by the North West Ambulance Service Crew who took Mohammad back to hospital for his second visit. However she directed the jury to conclude that these failings did not contribute to Muhammad’s death as it was then, in all probability, too late for him to be saved. The hearing heard that the issues raised, in relation to early medical intervention for sepsis patients, are of national importance.

Now, it seems theDuke of York has not been keeping promises he made to American investigators who want to speak to him about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.

Andrew doesn’t appear to be the man of honour he claimed to be in that car crash BBC talk with Emily Maitlis. The Queen’s third child promised to help law enforcement. What we’ve got instead appears to be stonewalling. We demand the Prince immediately arranges to be interviewed.The monarchy exists only with public consent and this kind of behaviour could prove more dangerous for The Firm than rows about Harry and Meghan.The Queen must step in again and remind Andrew to do his duty and speak to the FBI. Never forget The Nazi Holocaust was one of the most evil crimes in history. We must never forget it so that it never happens again. Survivors of unimaginable horrors at Auschwitz-Birkenau represent a uniquely moral force on the th anniversary of the liberation of the death camp where more than a million Jews and others were slaughtered.

Victoria Taylor, , carried out the unprovoked attack when she spotted the victim at an Italian restaurant. Taylor glassed the -year-old, who was not part of her party, as she stood at the bar, Leicestershire Live reports. Taylor - an accounts manager for a national pharmaceutical company - went over with a tumbler and unexpectedly struck her with it, causing cuts and bruising. The shocked -year-old victim also sustained scratches and had her hair pulled out during the ensuing fracas at a restaurant in Anstey on Friday, May . Elizabeth Dodds, prosecuting, told Leicester Crown Court: The complainant was enjoying the night out and standing at the bar on her own while her friend went out for a cigarette. She was approached by the defendant. They both knew of each other as the defendantaposs ex-boyfriend was the complainantaposs current partner at the time. The complainant described it as being an unprovoked attack. Miss Dodds said: The defendant lunged at her and struck her in the face. The complainant didnapost appreciate sheaposd been hit with a glass until she noticed there was a shard of glass in her face with blood dripping down. The prosecutor said that despite the poor quality of CCTV footage, it was apparent a scuffle then ensued. The victim sustained bruising to her right eye and two lacerations - which left slight facial scarring - as well as a nasty scratch mark across her chest.  Her foot was cut by broken glass and some of her hair was pulled out in the aftermath. Miss Dodds said: The injuries were less serious than they could have been. The complainant works at a school and she was quite embarrassed to have bruising and cuts on her face. Itaposs had an impact on her - with dficulty sleeping, vivid dreams and she fears bumping into the defendant again. When interviewed by the police the defendant claimed she had acted in self-defence - despite CCTV footage showing otherwise. However, the defendant, of Forest Gate, Anstey, went on to plead guilty to an offence unlawful wounding. Judge Mooncey said: This case has a complicated background.

Bryant’s helicopter slammed into a hill in Calabasas, near Los Angeles, on Sunday, killing the -year-old, his daughter Gianna, , and seven others. At one point the pilot was warned he was flying too low for “flight following”, meaning he could not be picked up by radar to be guided by air traffic control. Bryant’s helicopter left Santa Ana in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, just after am, when visibility was so poor that Los Angeles Police Department said it grounded its helicopters. An audio recording revealed the pilot asked to fly under special visual flight rules – SVFR. Although the official cause of the crash has not been determined, a conversation between pilot Ara Zobayan and Burbank Airport control tower shed some light on events. Under SVFR, pilots are allowed to fly in conditions worse than those permitted for visual flight rules – VFR. SVFR clearance is only issued when cloud ceilings are below , feet above ground. Flying that low can be disorienting and risky. Burbank allowed Zobayan to fly northeast, following the Interstate  highway with SVFR. “Maintain special VFR at or below ,,” Zobayan confirmed to the controller. Later, he asked for “flight following” – which puts controllers in regular contact with an aircraft.

And just to add, he still has childish sex organs. “Puberty has not started.

Thankfully we are blessed with fantastic landmarks across the globe which are also well worth a visit - and thataposs exactly what we wanted to show through this research.

And  per cent even said their entire outlook on le changed after visiting some places. Another three in  have been left speechless and a quarter have completely re-evaluated how they feel about a country.Eight in  believe visiting a countryaposs landmarks and other areas of signicance gives you a better understanding of that placeaposs culture. Despite the rise of social media and the internet, the study carried out through OnePoll, also found word of mouth is still the biggest inspiration for where those polled choose to visit.Four in  said they rely on recommendations from friends and family, however a third will depend on Google and a quarter will use guidebooks.Social media also has an influence too albeit not among quite so many travellers - Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.James Clarke added: Travelzoo exists to provide its members with the inspiration to travel to new and interesting places.

The child appears to be given a taste of Long White, a pre-mixed vodka drink, as it lays in just a nappy surrounded by cushions. A man, thought to be the totaposs dad, just sits and watches. The clip is believed to have been filmed in New Zealand with authorities being left appalled by the footage. However, the childaposs father has spoken out after claiming he has been threatened online, and said aposonly an idiot would feed a baby vodkaapos.  He told the New Zealand Herald:Me and my we and a couple of my mates were there and we [were] just joking around [with] her.Iaposm a father and my kids [are] my heart. But a photo later emerged of the same man, holding a pint of lager up to the babyaposs lips, with the caption: Her first Xmas eve and beer #bestdadever.  The video, which was circulated on Snapchat, appears to have been held at the One Love music festival held in Tauranga, which was held this weekend.

However, children will only be in the nursery for  weeks.The term-time service will run  weeks of the year.Aberdeen City Council has said it is committed to delivering flexible models.These include a full-day provision, for example am until pm during term time for five days, or am until pm for two and a half days for  weeks of the year.Other models are a half-day provision, a long morning or afternoon, or a blended provision which could be a combination of council provider and childminder for example.As a result, there may be dferent times available at dferent nurseries, as several options are given.Each nursery will have dferent provisions available, and parents are urged to check what is available for them.Childminders will receive the money for each funded place from the local authority, which will set the rate. vw, px\"  A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “As is the case for all providers delivering funded early learning and childcare from August, childminders will receive a sustainable hourly rate per child from their local authority.“Councils are responsible for setting these rates, to reflect local circumstances.“The longstanding legal position is that funded early learning and childcare must be delivered without the payment of fees, meaning it is unlawful for providers to charge parents and carers top-up fees for a child’s statutory early learning and childcare hours.“Families may, of course, choose to purchase additional hours and services from ELC providers.”For more information on the funded provision of ELC, visit bit.ly qoMPWA range of focus groups are also being carried out by Aberdeen City Council at associated school groups , the feeder primary schools for each academy, in order to discuss the upcoming changes.Some have already taken place, however, there are six still to go ahead.

Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

ScotWind Leasing will present Scotland as an attractive destination for the signicant investment needed to deliver the scale of offshore wind projects we want to see.’Employment was on the agenda at Campbeltown Community Council’s meeting last week.Chairman Alan Baker said: ‘We discussed the unemployment in the area due to ious redundancies that were issued, namely at Campbeltown Creamery and CS Wind.‘It was felt that after the initial meeting at the MACC premises that nothing further has been forthcoming.‘There is also to be a meeting in March with Fergus Ewing MSP to discuss further action.’The Courier asked both Mr Ewing’s office and the press office at the Scottish Government but no one could confirm the meeting was taking place, or when, by the time we went to press."},{"url":null,"title":"valuable support offered to argyll businesses","story":"As Scotland#s national business advice service, Business Gateway helps thousands of customers to meet their business goals every year.

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica.

So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her. But his daughterrsquos anecdotes and stories about the seat made it feel like a place of remembrance for him too.The power of stories, to rekindle memory and ease the sense of loss, became very real for both Jessica and her dad. At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to.

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

The issue ides Scotland, it would break the highly effective UK single market by creating an economic border between Scotland and our vital English market which is twice as important to us as the rest of the world and it would create uncertainty.Scottish business does not need uncertainty, ision or economic pygmyism from the Scottish Government. What it needs is pragmatism, co-operation and stability.A bit less than half of the Scottish electorate seems to want Independence but what does that actually mean  Most of us would like to be in the EU - a good idea in principle but a very bad idea , as it would, it created economic barriers between England and Scotland. A clear majority of us donrsquot want to join the Euro but in time,we re-joined the EU, we would have to.Do we want a Scottish Airforce or a Scottish DVLA  I doubt it. Do we think the cost involved in setting up our own comprehensive bureaucracy is a good thing or a needless expense reducing our ability to pay for schools and hospitals  Would we enjoy being told what to do by politicians in Brussels any more than by those in London When confronted by what Independence means in terms of hard specic realities people donrsquot actually like it very much. Last time the SNP were the exciting challenger now they are the failing incumbent - they would have a dficult selling job.There are, however, additional policy areas where it would be a good thing for Scotland to have more authority. If only the SNP would give up their isive drive for ldquoIndependence and actually engage with the Scottish electorate and the UK Government to build a consensus around a shared vision, so much could be possible.Take for example immigration. If there was a single bad reason why the pro-EU cause was lost it was probably immigration. In parts of England the pace and scale of immigration has been such that local services have struggled to cope and local people feel disadvantaged and displaced. Yet immigration, which brings young dynamic people to join our society, is a good thing. The problem in Scotland is not that we have too many immigrants but that we have too few. Our society is aging and the ratio of dependants to workers will, within a few decades, become dangerously high in terms of being able to afford good quality public services.What , instead of trying to constantly kick sand in the face of the UK Government and bleat that everything it does is an outrage or that Scotland has been ignored, the Scottish Government developed a focused agenda of additional powers - control of immigration being one, control of the railway infrastructure being another - which it would be sensiblewe could manage in Scotland. There is no reason why the powers of the Scottish Parliament could not be increased over time to build a better Britain which Scotland is genuinely comfortable being in. That would be a happier and more prosperous course for all of Scotland and its people.

One woman real, the other a beautully drawn imaginary portrait.Laying down the books what stayed with me was the essence, the spirit of both, and the feeling that one had grasped the mood of both countries.I know one country well, the other not at all. I know France well, or so I think, and certainly have grasped both history and mood all the more for living here.When I write about two of the three countries mentioned, I do so with the confidence of close contact of stories told and remembered of links forged republic to republic.I do the same with England and Scotland although I havenrsquot set foot in either for years. But I lived and worked in both. I switched listening modes from London to Glasgow as easily as switching TV channels and in Scotland reported on and witnessed a country rapidly evolving, gathering within it a fresh pride, a steely core to rid itself of dependence on Westminster. A desire ndash long before the words were so grotesquely appropriated by the Brexiters ndash to take back control.I lsquogotrsquo it. And I lsquogotrsquo the English too in their casual, arrogant ignorance and lack of interest in anything other than them.I got it having grown up in a country which also was powering towards a new destiny remembering the past but not in thrall to it looking forward to Europe and not back to the chains of an inglorious Empire.So, when I comment, I comment from a little knowledge, from a tapping in to, not just the history, but the spirit.It is why I am constantly surprised by commentators who pronounce on Scotland, on referendums and on the Party, which is the driving force for Independence.Many words are expended on reasons why that should not be, using suspect financial lsquofactsrsquo and endless repetition of half, long negated arguments that research would have knocked down immediately.Some of the arguments against Scotland leaving the Union are well-reasoned and well worth consideration but these too are knocked down by the lamentable chippiness of some who are as blind as the commentators they dismiss.Itrsquos a word blindness activated by what is seen as a malevolent force robbing and battering the Scots from time immemorial. That is not the truth but there is a truth contained within it.What irritates me above all in most of these comment pieces coming from over the Border, is absence, awareness. Absence of any attempt to delve under the demands to seek the almost indefinable ndash the spirit of a people.Any reading of history shows that movements grow slowly until suddenly, like a high tide, they gather and form until the point they are unstoppable.Sometimes though the expected tide doesnrsquot reach its watermark and flops against the bulwarks ndash becalmed, almost shocked at its sudden halt.If not careful, the Independence movement could reach that point and make no mistake, nothing is being spared by the Westminster Opposition to ensure it does.Confidence can be chipped away statistics twisted to enable doubt to take seed groups encouraged to agitate from within with public spats that only increase the nervousness of those unsure and uncertainthey want to leave the familiar.Cynicism in these times is good ndash but not too much. Passion is good ndash but must be controlled. Anger is good ndash but swallow pride and turn it outwards not back into the group.Much is made of Irelandrsquos struggle for independence and its success on the European stage. Some believe a whole nation rose up. In fact, the Easter rising was begun by a handful, ridiculed by Dubliners as they marched to the Four Courts.Captured, they could have gone down as yet another minor episode.

And, it transpires, a little more prevalent than had previously been thought.A pound. million programme carried out by Nevis Landscape Partnership involving  separate projects on Ben Nevis and the surrounding glen has just reached its conclusion.Over its five-year lespan, it has seen , trees raised from seed by children and planted in Glen Nevis to help to replace trees lost to deer, disease and the elements, and a new accessible path created at the foot of the mountain. It has also seen art, education and community engagement projects which have boosted understanding of the mountainrsquos unique habitat and history.And for the , visitors who every year trek the Benrsquos well-worn km path, loose, broken and lost stones have been replaced ndash making it a far less risky experience.But perhaps the most challenging ndash and revealing ndash project was the one that combined the efforts of  botanists, geologists and mountain guides in a painstaking and sometimes daredevil search for some of the tiniest inhabitants of Britainrsquos tallest peak.The North Face Survey took scientists roped to mountain guides for safety to some of the Benrsquos most challenging corries, gullies and scree-covered slopes, in a ldquoneedle in a haystack search for tiny specks of plant le.Perhaps remarkably for a mountain which has towered over Scottish le for thousands of years, the survey ventured into areas never previously explored by scientists.As well as shedding fresh light on the extent of the mountainrsquos fascinating plant le ndash leading to Scottish Natural Heritage to upgrade conditions from ldquounfavourable to ldquofavourable ndash the survey forged a remarkable appreciation between the climbers, botanists and geologists for the mountain, and helped ensure one of its best-loved gullies would remain accessible to climbers.According to Mike Pescod, a mountain guide and chair of Nevis Landscape Partnership, a key element of the project was to assess whether rare flowers in number four gully were adversely affected by climbers ndash an issue which raised fears that climbing in the area might be curbed to help ensure fragile plantsrsquo survival.ldquoWhen we were introduced to the botanists they alluded to ice axe-wielding climbers who ripped out plants, he recalled. ldquoBut after three years of working together, it was clear we shared a passion and enthusiasm for the place, landscape and the plants.Better still, their labours were rewarded with a series of remarkable results.Before the survey, only around  populations of its target species of alpine plants were thought to survive the harsh conditions of the North Face.However, the survey identied more than , including fresh sites for some of our rarest alpine plants.:The walk: Ben NevisThey include tufted saxrage, with its small, jagged leaves that measure only -mm and tiny white flowers with pale green veins to attract passing butterflies and flies, generally found nestling amid scree and rock clefts. And also exceedingly rare wavy meadow-grass ndash Poa flexuosa ndash classed as ldquovulnerable and found in only a few locations across the country.Perhaps most unexpected, however, was the discovery of two species of plants not previously found on the Ben: alpine saxrage, with deceivingly resilient flowers and more commonly found in Iceland, Greenland and Norway and curved woodrush, a short, grassy herb found on windswept, rocky summits and plateaus.There were flashes of colour found in the harshest and hardest locations: emerald green leaves and deep red catkins of female dwarf willows were discovered nestling amid the granite of Tower Ridge, involving a heart-pumping scramble and rock climb to reach.Alpine ladyrsquos mantle, drooping saxrage and fresh populations of white-flowered Arctic mouse-ear were also recorded ndash unfortunately, some at higher altitudes than expected, hinting at a movement uphill in search of colder climes.As well as noting the plantsrsquo locations, details of their health and size were recorded to provide a baseline for future botanical surveys.Alongside the scale of finding and documenting tiny plants across a vast area, botanists and climbers faced dficult terrain and complex logistical challenges of carrying huge amounts of rope, safety equipment and survey items up and down the mountain each day. Simply reaching dficult spots pushed climbers and their non-climbing colleagues to the limit.ldquoThe botanists had a degree of climbing ability, and were very capable of climbing over slimy, muddy places which climbers think are horrible. But when it comes to rope systems to help access m high clfs, it was beyond what they could to, added Pescod.ldquoClimbers are usually looking for nice, solid rock, but thatrsquos not where these plants grow. There were loose bits of rock and sharp edges, making it all a lot harder.While the survey has ended, he said climbersrsquo new knowledge of the mountainrsquos alpine plants means they now seek them out during outings, snapping images to share with botanists and passing on what they have learned to others.ldquoItrsquos lovely to be able to climb and know what these plants are that Irsquom looking at, he added. ldquoIt elevates your day.Although the botanical survey was one of the most intense of the  projects, the most obvious one for mountain visitors was the extensive repair of km of the Ben Nevis Path, damaged by tens of thousands of walkersrsquo boots.Fixing it involved , volunteer hours and a logistical headache after stone intended for repairs and stored high up the mountain couldnrsquot be moved because of adverse weather.:Police issue advice to climbers following Ben Nevis deathsAlternative granite from a nearby quarry was ruled out because it came from the wrong side of the tectonic plate, meaning stone had to be sourced from quarries  miles away.After , helicopter lts of almost  tonnes of stone, a pound, investment and five years of work, the path was completed last year.As well as improvement and conservation work, the NLP five-year programme included the first excavation of Dun Deardail, a vitried hillfort at the head of the Allt nan Gleannan valley, new paths leading to the rock climbing area of Polldubh Crags and work to improve drainage at the summit.While the  projects, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, have been declared a major success, Pescod has warned a question mark over future financial backing means there is uncertainty over conservation and environmental projects on Ben Nevis and its surrounding glen.ldquoAll the brilliant stuff over five years has tangible results, but the organisation behind it is at risk of collapsing, he said.ldquoWe are losing unbelievable experience and skill in staff because of the funding system.ldquoSo many people want to visit Ben Nevis, but it needs investment to look after it."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  We re heading for a hard Brexit on Friday  but it needn t have been this way","story":"But you could be forgiven for being unaware of this historic occasion, because it only merited a footnote on news bulletins.

But Brussels has now ruled out Scotland getting similar concessions to those granted to Northern Ireland. They wonrsquot even talk about it.None of this was inevitable. Under Mayrsquos deal, had it gone through in amended form, Parliament could still have been a major player in Brexit. For three long years, MPs had the power and authority to shape the Withdrawal Agreement ndash but they blew it. Now, Boris Johnson can do whatever he wants.Labour were largely silent this week, probably out of sheer embarrassment. They must know that they helped to make leaving the EU far harder than it need have been. They placed opposing Brexit higher than making the best of Brexit, so they ended up with the worst.It was common knowledge that most MPs favoured a Norway-style option of remaining in the single market while leaving the political institutions of Europe. Hard Brexiters might have complained that joining the EEA was a sellout, but Irsquom pretty sure voters would have accepted staying in the single market as the most sensible short-term solution.Voters werenrsquot bothered about free trade but about sovereignty and identity. Brexit wasnrsquot about erecting tarfs but curbing Brussels bureaucracy. It wasnrsquot really about immigration either. Boris Johnson is already relaxing immigration rules.And evenNorway proved unacceptable, there could have been a Swiss solution, which basically involves accepting the rules of the single market without actually joining it. This was really what Theresa Mayrsquos Brexit deal was moving towards.It sought ldquofrictionless trade by keeping the closest possible relationship with the EU.Her Irish backstop would have kept the entire UK in regulatory alignment with the single market.But the opposition parties werenrsquot having it. The SNP which had argued cogently for Norway plus for two years, suddenly turned into hardline Remainers.The Liberal Democrats went full revoke with disastrous consequences for their leader, Jo Swinson. Labour refused to accept the compromises offered by Theresa May last spring.Remainers thought they had Boris over a barrel that he couldnrsquot reopen the Withdrawal Deal. But he did. His backstop leaves Northern Ireland as a regulatory colony of the EU, but it was undeniably a new deal. Labour condemned it on the grounds that it abandoned Northern Ireland, even though theyrsquod previously claimed the PM was in the pocket of the DUP.Johnson has wasted no time demonstrating that he is not in the pocket of Donald Trump either by backing a digital tax on Google and by refusing to rule out Huaweirsquos involvement in G. Labour claims that the PM intended to ldquosell the NHS to Trump and allow chlorinated chickens to take over the supermarket shelves now look ridiculous.I know this is not how many of my Remain friends on Twitter see it. To them, Brexit was all about fighting fascism and ldquonativism. But the talk of creeping authoritarianism, ldquodark money, Russian interference was a kind of paranoid displacement activity ndash an excuse for not coming to a sensible compromise.The devolved parliaments last week voted to refuse consent to the Withdrawal Act. But any leverage the Scottish Government may have wielded has been lost by the General Election result. Holyrood will now be sidelined in future legislation on fish and farming.This week, on the eve of Brexit Day, Nicola Sturgeon says she will give her latest timetable for independence. But the SNP has no answer to the new constitutional reality: it will now be arguing for independence outside the European Union rather than from within it.Wersquore out of Europe, and wersquore going to stay out for a long time.

So things are speeding up.\"But he accepted their past erosion predictions were based on past rates, and do not include future sea level change.While an updated analysis is expected in the summer, Prof Hansom warned of the need for urgent action.\"The key thing is you hear a lot of things about climate change and reducing carbon emissions to tackle temperature increases and that is not going to help us for another  years,\" said Prof Hansom, an honorary research fellow at the University of Glasgows School of Geographical and Earth Sciences.\"We have got an adaptational problem now that needs to be addressed, before any of these carbon emission stabilisations or reductions actually produce any effect.\"He believed work is urgently required to reinforce Scotlands eroding coastline through articial extensions of the nations beaches to protect them from the ever-encroaching sea.:Race to save Scotlands greatest golf courses from the seaHe said Holland was leading the way in spending millions of pounds a year in using sand and sediment extracted offshore and deposited to replenish beaches and help shore the coastline up, but Scotland and the UK is lagging behind.\"There is an immediate problem that needs to be addressed now. Think about what is going to happen to your coastline before temperature stabilises,\" he said.\"You have to think seriously about what happens at Edinburgh seafront, what happens across the Glasgow seafront, not to mention the hundreds of wee towns along the coast like Arbroath and Stonehaven and Stornoway.\"When you think where our sewage sites are they are close to sea level, where our railways and roads that hug the coast, they are going to be jeopardised, many are going to be under threat in  or  years time. Before we begin to stabilise carbon emissions and control the temperature, we have got these sea level rises happening now, \" added Prof Hansom, who also said it does not make sense to develop areas that are close to sea level.A new MCCIP report fed into by more than  scientists warns that the latest UK sea-level rise projections is \"higher than previous estimates, implying increased coastal-flood risk\".\"The likelihood of compound effects from tidal flooding and extreme rainfall is increasing, which can greatly exacerbate flood impacts,\" it said.Montrose has been cited as anexample of the threat of climate change to the future of links golf in Scotland.Aseparate analysis on the impact of climate change on coasts but with a focus on transport and infrastructure says that it is estimated the average erosion rates around the Scottish coastline have doubled since the s to . metre per year.: New flood warnings as Orkney predicted to have highest water levels for  yearsNearly , miles of UK transport infrastructure is considered to be at risk of flooding.The report says there are \"several vulnerable stretches\" of railway track including the Ayrshire Coast Line.The  Dynamic Coast project used information drawn from more than , maps and a million data points and was carried out by experts from the Scottish government, Scottish Natural Heritage and the University of Glasgow.It was then discovered that the erosion of the coastline had doubled in speed over the previous  years.Two weeks ago there were warnings of extensivecoastalflooding acrossScotland- as Storm Brendan battered the country.The ScottishEnvironmentProtection Agencysaid that on Orkney on Tuesday at Stromness, Stronsay, Scapa, Sanday, Westray, St Margarets Hope, Longhope and Hoy, Burray and Ayre of Cara, water levels were predicted to be the highest in the last  yearsIt warned that any properties that hadbeen affected by coastal flooding in the past were likely to be at risk."},{"url":null,"title":"sake-children-must-take-climate-action-now","story":"It is now acknowledged by most scientists who have researched the causes and possible solutions to climate change, that the economic costs of mitigation ndash preventative measures ndash are much, much, smaller than the likely costs of adaptation to the effects of climate change. My motto, for the sake of my grandchildren is \"better safe than sorry\".Rose Harvie, Dumbarton.IN focusing on the possible costs of carbon reduction actions Charles Wardrop, conveniently forgets another economic measure, the opportunity costs of not reducing these emissions.The distress and financial costs to Australian friends through the intense bush fires give just one cameo of the total likely to be incurred by the whole worldDonald Trump and Dr Wardrop succeed in persuading us not to bother cutting emissions. There is a technique in economics called discounting, which tries to compare costs incurred today with benefits which only accrue years later. This technique reduces the value of future benefits by a proportion for each year that elapses before they are achieved. The proportion is called the discount rate, and the higher it is, the lower a value is placed on benefits accruing in the future compared to their current cost. The value of the discount rate is related to current financial interest rates, so given the negligibleon investments at the moment with a bank rate below half of one percent, one would now expect the discount rate to be similarly low, and future benefits to be highly valued. Dr Wardrop and his ilk clearly do not recognise this, and would set a mental discount rate close to  per cent, totally devaluing future benefits.The last straw for any reasonable humanitarian is his suggestion that, because Scotlands emissions are only a small proportion of the global total, nothing need be done. So at what percentage of the total does it become morally necessary to take action  In Dr Wardrop and Mr Trumps world, there is no level at which emissions cannot be considered to be trivial. Future generations are likely to judge matters in a very dferent way.Dr RM Morris, Ellon.IN an era of gloomy prophecies, the absurd Doomsday Clock claims to count down the seconds to a looming global apocalypse. But even the most scientically challenged must suspect it is conflating disparate threats with ying degrees of urgency: nuclear war, climate change, and emerging technologies.The stated motivation of those involved in this absurdity is to apply pressure to governments by calling on citizens ldquoto express themselves in all the ways available to them. But we already have the endless rants of the Swedish prophetess Greta Thunberg and most of us could do with just the tiniest break.Rev Dr John Cameron, St Andrews.THE fiscal lunacy of spending pound billion on foreign aid is worth exposing. First, we dont actually have pound billion to give away. As we run a deficit economy, that money has to be borrowed ndash at interest of course.Our cumulative annual deficits to date ndash the National Debt ndash amount to pound trillion.

One more Labour government would do it, but the money wasted on becoming carbon neutral will certainly do itwe dont wake up to the fact that climate change is a plot to collapse the western financial system.And evenwe were to continue with this daft scheme, we need only to look at the plight of Australia to find a deserving recipient for poundbn.Malcolm Parkin, Kinross."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-nasty-brutal-brazen-undercover-scottish-fox-hunt","story":"Fortunately, there is someone here who can put a stop to it: an investigator whorsquos been watching the whole thing from behind a line of trees. He steps out into the open and speaks to one of the men whorsquos supposed to be controlling the dogs. Suddenly, the atmosphere changes. The hunters call out to the pack and blow their horns and get the hounds under control. The fox has escaped. This time.The investigator, who works for the League Against Cruel Sports, has seen it all before. He has been working on investigations into animal cruelty for  years and Irsquove been out a few times with him on his undercover work. It is tough going. One time, we had to be up at .am. We wear green and brown to blend into the countryside and prevent us being seen. Itrsquos often cold, wet, and miserable. And it leaves me angry and appalled that the law on hunting with dogs is being broken in Scotland so openly, so brutally, and so brazenly.I canrsquot tell you the name of the investigator for obvious reasons ndash he has been threatened with violence and his work would be compromisedthe men and women who hunt foxes knew who he was. But I can tell you what hersquos seen. He has seen many, many foxes running for their lives, like that vixen near Jedburgh. He has seen foxes being disembowelled alive. Hersquos seen a gang of men dig down into a den for an hour just for the privilege of letting their dogs tear a fox apart.:Time to really ban fox hunting in Scotland, for goodAll of it is against the law. In , the Protection of Wild MammalsAct banned the hunting of foxes with dogs, apart from an exemption for the purposes of pest control: according to the law, hunters can still use dogs to flush foxes out of cover so they can be shot. What this means is that, as soon as a fox breaks cover, the dogs should be called back. Either the fox is shot at that point or it gets away. The dogs cannot continue to chase it andthey do, it is a breach of the law.But letrsquos compare that to the hunt in the Borders, shall we  There are several men around, one on a quadbike, several on horseback none of them appear to be carrying guns, which you would expect to seethey were obeying the law. We see the fox break cover and about five minutes later we see the hounds following the scent. We do not hear anyone attempting to control the dogs or anyone calling them back, until the investigator steps forward.What the hunters say in response is that the public is being misled by anti-hunters. When I asked them about the incident in the Borders, the Jed Forest Hunt said there were guns present. Their spokesman at the Scottish Countryside Alliance also told me they were operating a legal pest control service in compliance with the  Act, whereas the League Against Cruel Sports was using the deceitful practice of hiding in bushes and heavily edited footage to suggest illegal practices. The public are being deceived, said the spokesman.However, Irsquove seen the unedited footage. I have been out with the investigator on other investigations and I know what my common sense is telling me: the law on hunting is being broken in Scotland, regularly, openly and blatantly. As for the men and women who do it, the investigator says this of them: ldquoThey are setting a pack of dogs on to wild animals itrsquos like hare coursing. They may dress a little better and they may ride horses, but thatrsquos the only dference. When you see them out in the field, itrsquos savage.Whatrsquos galling for anyone who cares about putting a stop to fox hunting is that the response to the savagery has been spinelessness and a weak law thatrsquos failing to protect wild animals. The Bonomy Review into fox hunting in  said quite clearly that there was evidence that flushing foxes from cover was being used as a decoy for the continuation of traditional hunting practices, and last year the Scottish Government said it would put a stop to it and would bring forward a bill to strengthen the legislation.:Campaigners lodge petition to stop bloodthirsty US hunter from ing to ScotlandBut nothing has happened. There has been no real support either, as far as I can see, for the Green MSP Alison Johnstonersquos private memberrsquos bill which would do what the Government says it wants to do. The Government could fast-track that bill. It hasnrsquot.So what we need ndash quickly, before many more foxes are killed by dogs ndash is a law that deals with the situation as it really is. Men and women are out there, in Scotland, in the open, two or three times a week, for months on end, hunting and killing foxes with dogs, which means the law needs to ban the use of dogs altogether. Such a ban would also help expose the huntersrsquo claims that their aim is to control foxes. This is not about control. This is a sport. Itrsquos a hobby ndash a savage, bloody and barbaric hobby.What the Government needs to say to these people is: you cannot pursue your grubby little hobby here and we will pass a law to make sure you canrsquot. In the meantime, we are relying on the anti-hunters, and the investigators, and anyone with compassion, to keep up the pressure. There is hope of change in Scotland.

Because what happens in these things is trade-offs. For example, the United Kingdom has a very strong position on fisheries. The UK has a lot of waters and a lot of fish is taken out of your waters by boats from other countries but bear in mind  per cent of the fish you sell, you sell into Europe.\"So unless British people are going to start eating an awful lot more fish, you have a problem there. But thats an area where youre in a strong position. An area where youre in a very weak position is one of the most valuable parts of the British economy which is financial services. Its such a crucial part of the of the British economy. And areas like the entertainment industry. Andfinancial services and entertainment, audio visual are cut off from the single market, the European market, that will be a very severe blow to the British economy and the southeast, in particular in London.\"So, you know, you may have to make concessions in areas like fishing in order for us, in order to get concessions from us in areas like financial services and thats why things tend to be all in the one package,\" he added.Boris Johnsonrsquos spokesman insisted: ldquoOur position on fishing is not going to change. We are going to be taking back control of our own fishing waters.Askedthat ruled out any quid pro quo deal with the EU, he replied: ldquoWe are taking back control of our waters. We have been clear on that both in the manesto and when the PM spoke with the Commission President. The EU should be in no doubt about our determination on that issue.Askedldquofull control of our fishing waters also meant giving access to EU states, he said: ldquoIt will be for the UK to determine in the best interests of the United Kingdom who fishes in its waters.However, a leaked European Council memo that promised to ldquodemonstrate particular vigilancehellipin protecting fishing enterprises and coastal communities raised concern among Scottish politicians.And last week, Charles Grant, the Director of the Centre for European Reform, told a Holyrood committee that senior UK Government officials had indicated they would ldquotrade-off or ldquobargain with Scottish fishing to ldquoget a better deal on financial services.Stewart Stevenson, the SNP MSP, said: ldquoDespite the Tories promises, Scotlandrsquos fishing industry could end up with precisely no gains whatsoever from Brexit. Worse still, it looks like our fishermen could be subject to Common Fisheries Policy rules without even having a voice or a say on the inside.ldquoBoris Johnson needs to be held to account for his  promises the Tories sold out Scottish fishermen on the way into Europe, and theyrsquoll do the same on the way out.He added: ldquoWersquore just days away from crashing out of the EU against our will. Itrsquos time for some honesty from the Tories on how they intend to secure a close economic partnership with Europe without putting fishing on the table.Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland MP, also expressed concern and urged the UK Government not to use fisheries as a ldquobargaining chip in the trade negotiations with the EU.Speaking after meeting members of the Norwegian Fisheries Committee at Westminster, Mr Carmichael said: ldquoDocuments from the European Commission make it plain that they see the status quo as the goal for fisheries negotiations. The Government must prove it has some political will to fulfil the many promises made about an independent fisheries policy during and after the election.ldquoTheir words say one thing actions speak louder. The move of fisheries from the binding Withdrawal Agreement into the non-binding Political Declaration already suggests that the Government may not be all that invested in lsquotaking back controlrsquo in this area.ldquoWe saw the irony last week of a Brexit Party MEP complaining that we will spend the rest of  under the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. This is a direct consequence of the Governmentrsquos abandonment of our fishermen.He added: ldquoNorthern Isles fishermen remember all too well the last time a Tory Government treated the fishing industry as expendable. Repeated, explicit promises by this Government to fishermen must be respected. Fisheries are not Boris Johnsonrsquos bargaining chip with Brussels.But last Wednesday during his Peoplersquos PMQs from Downing, Mr Johnson made clear the UK Government would not ldquotrade away access to Britainrsquos fishing waters.He was askedhe could guarantee the UK would have full control of its fishing waters after Brexit, the PM replied: ldquoYes, we will take back control of our fishing waters. We will ensure that we become an independence coastal state once again, having full jurisdiction over the -mile limit of our spectacular maritime wealth.ldquoWe will make sure we donrsquot trade away Britainrsquos fishing rights as they were traded away for instance in the accession negotiations in the early s.

I donrsquot underestimate how challenging this is going to be.ldquoBut equally I know what the risks and the realities will bewe donrsquot have this.ldquoIf yoursquore going to have a UK-wide system that is trying to cut migration, and that is a one size fits all, thatrsquos pretty disastrous for Scotland.ldquoSothey want to have that objective in the rest of the UK, but allow some iation within Scotland, then therersquos a discussion to be had there.ldquoIf there is a complete blanket refusal to discuss these things, this sort of view that the Westminster system is incapable of accommodating Scotlandrsquos distinctive interest, just becomes more and more of a real thing.However the Home Office immediately rejected the idea, saying the new immigration system being introduced in  would remain reserved to Westminster.A Home Office spokesperson said: ldquoImmigration will remain a reserved matter. The UK Government will introduce a points-based immigration system that works in the interests of the whole of the United Kingdom, including Scotland.ldquoWe want to understand the specic needs of the whole of the UK, which is why we have engaged extensively with stakeholders across the UK, including the Scottish Government.A UK Government source added: We are not planning to devolve immigration, not least because Scottish businesses do not want that to happen.ldquoThey fear the additional red tape it would bring.The issues facing Scotland are not unique to Scotland, so we want to develop a system that is flexible enough to work for all parts of the UK.There has been less migration to Scotland than to some other parts of the UK.ldquoThe Scottish Government have extensive economic powers and should be using those to make Scotland a more attractive place to settle, live and work.\"SNP migration ministerBen Macpherson said:ldquoThe proposals for a tailored migration policy for Scotland are supported by employers, universities and organisations across Scotland and are an essential part of sustaining and improving economic growth, prosperity and public services.ldquoA failure by the UK Government to support proposals to meet Scotlandrsquos unique needs would be a further sign that the system does not work for Scotland, and it is to be hoped the UK Government rethinks this out of touch response.SNP MSP Tom Arthur said: ldquoIndustry and employers recognise that getting the migration system right is vital for our social and economic wellbeing, and the support shown for the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposals are heartening.ldquoConsidering that support, the UK government need to do much better than a curt dismissal.ldquoSimply dismissing this serious plan out of hand proves our point that Westminster doesnrsquot work for Scotland.Labour MSP Claire Baker said: ldquoScotland faces particular demographic challenges, and we need a compassionate, fair immigration system that supports our economy, public services and all our people.ldquoTherefore, Scottish Labour supports exploring a degree of flexibility within an overarching UK immigration system. We look forward to seeing the detail of the governmentrsquos proposals.Alison Evison, president of the council umbrella group Cosla, added: ldquoCoslawould like this policy paper to start a meaningful debate on what our immigration system should look like post-Brexit.\"There is a strong unied voice across all sectors in Scotland in favour of a flexible immigration system that can meet our particular economic, workforce and population needs.\"For many years, Coslahas been calling for an immigration system that can be responsive to local as well as national needs and that recognises and addresses the challenges that we face.\"We have to identy more policy levers to encourage people to move to Scotland and Local Government has a key role to play in developing an immigration system that works for every part of Scotland.\"We look forward to engaging in a fruitful conversation to enable this to happen.Andrew McRae of the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland, said: ldquoThe new paper from the Scottish Government is a timely and evidence-based intervention.ldquoIt sets out a pathway towards a UK system that can flex for Scotlandrsquos distinct demographic and economic needs, without creating additional burdens for smaller businesses.ldquoThe UK Government should acknowledge that it is possible and desirable to enable its immigration system to respond to dferent regions and nations, as well as maintain strict border controls and a user-friendly system."},{"url":null,"title":"succession-star-brian-cox-reveals-turn-knighthood-calling-cbe-mistake","story":"The Dundee-born actor, a strong backer of Scottish independence, admitted he should have ldquothought better of collecting the honour for services to drama in .:Successions Brian Cox recommends getting stoned on cannabis to deal with politicsGolden Globe winner Cox, who stars in the HBO series as Logan Roy, added he would reject the offer of becoming a knight, despite calling the CBE a ldquoprecursor to the most senior honour.The -year-old caused controversy earlier this month when he was dropped as a patron of an elderly care home after admitting to regularly smoking cannabis as a way of ldquodealing with the political situation on both sides of the Atlantic.He said: ldquoI have a royalist sister and a republican sister and I thought, well my royalist sister will be happy but she couldnrsquot give a s**t.

The Bioersity Challenge Fundspecically encourages applicants with innovative projects that improve bioersity and address the impact of climate change, increasing the resilience of our most at-risk habitats and species and creating large areas of brand new or restored habitat.Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: “We all have a central role to play in combating bioersity loss and tackling the global climate emergency.“Bioersity loss and climate change are intimately bound together. Nature plays a key role in defining and regulating our climate and climate is key in shaping the state of nature.“People and communities who want to be at the forefront of pioneering work to restore our habitats, protect our species and promote nature can now apply for additional support through the Bioersity Challenge Fund.”Scottish Natural Heritage chief executive Francesca Osowska has been excited by the very high quality of applications received so far, and would love to hear even more bright ideas.“People know that climate change is a big issue but not as many know that bioersity loss is also a global and generational threat to human well-being,” she said. “Pollinators are a vital part of the building blocks of le on earth, and we need to support all of Scotland’s bioersity, from bees and butterflies to pondle and peatlands, because enriching our nature is also an important part of the solution to the climate emergency.“Nature is at the heart of what we do, and we will continue to deliver the transformational change needed to bring a nature-rich future for Scotland.”More information about the fund can be found at Bioersity Challenge Funddata-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The fire service is eager for us all to avoid the devastating consequences of white goods catching fire in our homes.\"  Fires caused by white goods are a daily occurence viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"10k of free shopping up for grabs at lidl","story":"Scottish Lidl shoppers are in with the chance to win #, of free shopping this Saturday .In celebration of the retailer’s th store opening on Burn’s Day in Cowdenbeath, the first  customers through the tills at all stores across Scotland will be in with a chance of winning £ of Lidl vouchers.Customers will receive an exclusive goody bag of Scottish products including a box of Deluxe Scottish Selection shortbread – with one in each store containing the lucky winning voucher.Alongside the competition, the retailer will stock over  Scottish favourites for under £ each from Saturday, including brands such as Mrs Tilly’s, Nairns and Baxters.Ross Millar, Lidl GB Regional Director - Scotland, said: “It’s a year of momentous milestones at Lidl as we celebrate our th year in Scotland and look forward to opening our th store on Saturday.“Since opening our first store in Scotland, we have built a network of over  Scottish suppliers and, as our estate grows across the country, we will continue to support local producers and proudly serve communities from Kirkwall to Stranraer.”The retailer is currently undertaking a fun-filled tour of music and food with Scottish singer songwriter, KT Tunstall.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpeg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Doric Board chair, Frieda Morrison, said the Doric Board was delighted to be able to support this terric range of projects from all across the North East.\"  Doric Boards New Year awardsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The partnership is part of a national drive preventing and eradicating violence against women and girls at a local strategic level.\"  Aberdeenshire partners set out plan to tackle Violence Against Women viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"good turnout for wildlife group event","story":"About  people attended the first meeting of the Bailies of Bennachie Wildle group recently.

In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.hawick-news webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Hands-on...Superintendent Sharon Comriehas worked for the SSPCA for an incredible  years.

I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

I was surrounded by a phenomenal group of kind and supportive people from all walks of le who had me laughing through every mental and physical challenge the wall had to give us. The views are so breath-taking no photo can do it justice, the challenge pushed me past my limits and rewarded me in ways I never expected.“I learned so much about the Chinese culture and had the adventure of a letime. I made the most amazing memories and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone , I will cherish every moment for the rest of my le and feel privileged to have been had this experience and to have raised funds and awareness for CLAN at the same time.”CLAN head of income generation and business development Fiona Fernie commented: “We are so grateful to everyone who undertakes challenges to raise money for CLAN.“We never underestimate how hard people work to raise money for CLAN and it is rewarding to hear when our supporters have had really positive experiences doing so. CLAN receives no statutory money from government bodies, and our services are completely funded by the work we and our supporters do.“In , we saw a % increase in the number of people who came to us for support, and so we need even more people to join us in fundraising.“The group that went to China in October had the adventure of a letime and the money they raised will go towards providing wellbeing support and services for people affected by cancer across the north-east.“Taking part in a challenge such as the Great Wall of China can be daunting so we are delighted to welcome the team from Global Adventures and some of ’s participants who I know will share their enthusiasm and help build excitement for the  trek.”For more information please contact fundraising@clanhouse.org or visit the CLAN website.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Primary School pupils with the cooking team and their special guests at the kitchen opening event\"  School celebrates new kitchen viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"traffic","story":"ScotRail has launched a new campaign encouraging people to stop and think about their own personal safety while travelling or at work.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

When he first came to this country, in , his English was almost non-existent. He made many mistakes. On one occasion he put a letter in a bin bearing the legend LITTER. But he was a hard worker and a quick learner. And by the mid-s, he could hold his own at Scrabble. One of my memories of him involves him freaking out because he had forgotten the Italian word for grapefruit. It’s “pompelmo” – one of the few words I do remember from back then, along with “zanzari”and “fiammeri” .I wasn’t brought up bilingual. My dad worked long hours and I spent most of my time with my Scottish mum. Instead, I was sent to Saturday morning Italian classes, which I hated because most of the other children there spoke it at home. Now and again, my dad would decree the dinner table an Italian-only zone. Those nights I ate in sullen silence.Then, when I was , my dad died, and so, though I later went on to sit my Higher, I never became fluent enough to keep up with the noisy, free-flowing conversation that is integral to Italian family le.With hindsight, this feels like a pity. Being able to speak more than one language is a gt. It widens your horizons and makes you more employable Also, language and culture are intimately connected. A country’s language shapes its ideas as surely as it expresses them. It is fundamental to its identity and its sense of humour. When you do not share a language, it is dficult to share jokes. And the ability to share jokes is at the heart of human relationships.My lack of fluency was in part responsible for my eventual detachment from my Italian heritage. If your language skills are patchyyou are unable to grasp sub-text and innuendo and nuance, then, however hard you try to belong, you will always be on the outside looking in.I have been thinking about all this since I read about the Comhairle Nan Eilean Siarplan to increase bilingualism. From next year pupils starting primary will be taught in Gaelic, switching to English only in Primary , by which point speaking Gaelic ought to be second nature to them.The idea is inspired. Around , of the Western Isles’ population speak the language and more than half of parents already opt into Gaelic Medium Education . However, by making GME the default setting, with an opt-out for parents who are opposed, the local authority is positioning bilingualism as the norm.Anyone who has witnessed their primary school child being taught French as part of the Scottish government’s + policy will understand the limitations of trying to shoe-horn a foreign language into an overcrowded curriculum. GME overcomes those limitations. And it’s an approach that is increasingly popular where. The number of children enrolled in Canada’s French immersion schools rose by a fth between  to  as aspirational parents realised the educational benefits.In this context, Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith’s intervention last week looks out of touch. She called the Western Isles’ move “deeply troubling” and suggested being taught in Gaelic could put pupils at a disadvantage. But there is no evidence for this. As human cognitive neuroscientist Dr Thomas Bak pointed out in a letter to The Scotsman such a view is based on the assumption that – as there is only a limited space in our brain – adding something new means taking something  away.“It assumes all pieces of knowledge that we learn are unconnected,” he wrote. “This is not the case. Every new piece of information we get is integrated with already existing knowledge and in this way can strengthen rather than weaken what we know already.”Studies show bilingual children outstrip their monoglot counterparts in cognitive tests and these advantages extend into later le with bilingualism linked to the delayed onset of dementia and better recovery after a stroke.Encouraging more Gaelic speaking will also redress some of the damage done by the  Education Act and help reconnect the next generation with their own culture. This pernicious piece of legislation put an end to Gaelic medium schools and punished those who continued to use the language.Establishment contempt for the country’s minority languages continued into the second half of the th century with those who expressed themselves in anything other than standard English still belted as late as the s.Not surprisingly this evocative language started to die out. Between  and , the number of Gaelic speakers dropped from , to , .In the s, however, there was a sht in thinking. Politicians began to realise the potential for Gaelic to revive depopulated areas and stimulate economic growth. There was increased funding for Gaelic arts, television and education, with Gaelic medium schools opening in the central belt as well as in traditional Gaelic-speaking areas.Until recently, there was a cross-party consensus on its importance. In , a law to protect and promote Gaelic was passed by the then Labour administration at Holyrood.As with much , however, Gaelic was re-politicised by the indyref with ultra unionists perceiving it as a nationalist totem. So now, every attempt to bolster it is met with a backlash. How much ink has been wasted whining about the cost of Gaelic road signs  Though, Transport Scotland says only £, was spent between  and , and the Scottish government has only ever received two complaints.The same sentiments have been expressed over the addition of Scots on to the primary school curriculum, although reading a handful of poems is unlikely to turn pupils into SNP activists.It’s not unusual, of course, for minority languages to face opposition. Disagreements over the Irish Language Act – which should give the Irish language equal status in Northern Ireland – contributed to the collapse of Stormont. But such hostility is short-sighted. Moderate and culturally-minded unionists understand this. Last week, Donald Cameron, Tory MSP for the Highlands and Islands, tweeted his support for the Western Isles’ plan . Distancing himself from Smith, he said his party had been promoting Gaelic for  years.This was not the first time Cameron had spoken up. In , he appealed to ultra unionists to tone down their rhetoric on the language. Having studied it himself, he understands its value.What the Western Isles is trying to do is impressive. If it succeeds it will produce a generation of children as much at home with Gaelic as with English. As someone who missed out on bilingualism, I’m glad its pupils are being given a skill that will keep them in touch with their heritage. And I find it deeply troubling that anyone would seek to stand in their way.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"how would the snp s scottish visa system work","story":"Nicola Sturgeon appeared in Edinburgh today to call on the UK Government to engage with proposals for a separate Scottish visa system aimed at tackling the countrys post-Brexit needs.Under the Scottish Governments preferred model for the scheme, which would require talks with the UK Government due to immigration being reserved, migrants would apply separately to the Scottish Government for a visa to live only in Scotland and Holyrood would recommend applicants to the Home Office.But how does the proposed system work • Targets to bring down migration to the UK would be ended• Fees and charges for UK immigration should be reviewed and simplied, removing \"financial and administrative burdens\"• A new-points based system for the UK should follow international examples and include regional or devolved schemes•Family migration should be \"signicantly reviewed\", looking at definition of family members, costs, and children born here• The employer-sponsored visa should have a lower salary threshold• The proposed transitional -month visa should be extended to  months and made a permanent option for EU citizens after the UK leaves the EU• Arrangements for working visitors should be extended to six months, and a broader range of activities should be allowed©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch here s why the tories have it so wrong on gaelic","story":"Liz Smith should be proud. The Scottish Conservatives# education spokesperson has single-handedly propelled Gaelic to the top of Scotland#s cultural agenda with her roundly condemned snub to Scotland#s ancient language.The linguistic rammy began when Western Isles Councilannounced plans to provide only Gaelic medium educationin Primary . Parents can opt outthey want children taught in English. Last Thursday in Holyrood, Liz Smith said the move was “deeply troubling” and would put pupils in the Western Isles at a “distinct disadvantage.” Why Has Ms Smith not read the copious evidence which shows that bi-lingual childrenhave better job prospects and better cognitive health in later le  I’m sure she has. Liz Smith seems to take her job seriously and has always appeared well-briefed and relatively open to new ideas.So, does the Tory MSP just have a problem with Gaelic  If so, she must have missed the fact that Sgoil Ghàidhlig Ghlaschuregularly outperforms every other secondary in Glasgow, with half of sixth years achieving five or more Highers. Strange.Ms Smith has somehow also missed the fact that UK language studentslag behind only lawyers, medics and vets in employability. It also seems that even when language graduates are not employed to speak their primary language, the fact they’ve spoken two languages from a young age, makes it far easier to learn more. It’s this versatility, this aptitude for overcoming cultural barriers, this belief in the innate ability of humans to connect and this willingness to inhabit the mindset of other cultures that makes bi-lingual students so very valuable. But I suspect Liz Smith knows that. I’m also guessing Ms Smith agrees with Dr Thomas H. Bak, an expert in human cognitive neuroscienceat Edinburgh University, who observed in a letter to this paper: “There is a wealth of evidence suggesting bilingual children outperform monolingual ones on cognitive tests ... and these effects are not confined to childhood, [but] continue across the lespan leading to a slower cognitive ageing, delayed onset of dementia and better cognitive recovery after stroke. Remarkably, an improvement in attention has been documented in participants of all ages after a one-week intensive language course … in Gaelic.”I imagine she was also nodding at the views of Professor Wilson McLeod of Edinburgh University, who told a Sunday newspaper why no Mandarin or German-medium schools exist in Scotland“We have Gaelic medium education because parents fought like hell to get it. They organised, they mobilised, they petitioned, and lobbied councillors and just wouldn’t let go. There have been other programmes – there was one in Italian in Glasgow, one in French in Aberdeen. They have never really gone anywhere, there has never been a drive for it.”Quite. There’s a big drive to learn Gaelic at the moment – prompted in part by the young Gaels behind Scots Gaelic Duolingo. Perhaps Liz Smith hadn’t heard of this sassy new online learning package. I imagine she has now.Last year, this small group of Gaelic language activists successfully lobbied Duolingo – a free language learning  with more than  million users and  languages – to include Scots Gaelic. Now it has  thousand signed-up students – that’s twice as many as the official Gaelic-speaking total and includes , who joined in the wake of Liz Smith’s remarks, and a related newspaper article which attacked bi-lingual road-signs, the efficacy of Bòrd na Gàidhlig and the “sacred cow” status of the Gaelic language.Add in the patient, educational work of the Feisean movementthrough the medium of Gaelic since the s. Add in the inspirational influence of Gaelic-speaking musicians from Julie Fowlis and Karen Mathieson to Peat n Diesel and the director of Celtic Connections, Donald Shaw. Even folk who don’t speak Gaelic now know for sure they’re missing something. That wasn’t true even five years ago.Perhaps that’s why Liz Smith made a welcome about-turn this weekend when she tweeted an apology “to those members of the Gaelic community who have been offended. My concerns did not relate to the quality of GME teaching  learning, both of which have such a strong record”.Of course, that only raised more questions. If the standard of Gaelic Medium teaching isn’t the problem then what is  Many think it’s a straightforward belief that Gaelic’s a “loser language”. This kind of cultural cringe is certainly well-documented but also outdated and faintly embarrassing.As Argyll MSP and Brexit Minister Mike Russell tweeted last week “It’s very sad to see someone as intelligent as Liz Smith parroting such nonsense.” So, does the MSP for Mid Scotland and Fe really share the tired, old, knuckle-dragging aversion to Scotland’s precious, traditional cultures  I’ll stick my neck out and say I don’t think so. More likely she has been sucked into the dark side of Toryism by the need to fit in with new political masters swept to power south of the Border on a xenophobic, anti-foreigner  of pro-Brexit isolationism.Last February, a BBC report showed that the places most likely to have no French or German teaching in school were the biggest Leave areas in England. Maybe it’s a coincidence, but maybe it reflects a worrying pushback against the sound of languages other than English being spoken in Britain. Does that pushback now include the indigenous languages of Scotland  If so, it’s a massively dangerous development.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon s scottish immigration visa plan refused by uk government","story":"The UK government has immediately ruled out Nicola Sturgeons proposal to devolve immigration to Holyrood.The First Minister today launched a proposal to introduce a Scottish visa, to ensure Scotlands population and workforce were able to grow post-Brexit.The plan would have seen no cap on immigration, and there were also no details as to how to ensure migrants to Scotland would not end up working in other parts of the UK.: Watch as Nicola Sturgeon reveals details of her Scottish visa plansHowever the Scottish Government had hoped its -page document would open negotiations on how a \"tailored\" immigration scheme could work for Scotland.But within hours of Ms Sturgeon unveiling the proposal, the UK government said immigration would remain a \"reserved matter\" and the new scheme being currently being created would apply to the whole of the UK, as introducing dferentials would make the system \"massively complicated\".A Home Office spokesperson said:“Immigration will remain a reserved matter. The UK Government will introduce a points-based immigration system that works in the interests of the whole of the United Kingdom, including Scotland.“We want to understand the specic needs of the whole of the UK, which is why we have engaged extensively with stakeholders across the UK, including the Scottish Government.”Boris Johnsons new immigration system will operate from  and it is expected to be based on Australias point-based immigration. The Migration Advisory Committee is expected to report shortly into how such a system would operate.It is also reviewing the proposed £, minimum salary threshold for migrant workers, and UK ministers have already signalled they are ready to drop the level after concern from business leaders that it could prevent workers needed to support the economy from entering the UK.There are already UK-wide and Scotland specic \"Shortage Occupation Lists\" and Mr Johnson has said he wants a system based on applicants’ skills and qualications as well as labour shortages.He has said migrants will be sorted into three categories: exceptionally talented people such as “nuclear physicists”, who would be granted free entry skilled workers, who could settlethey had a job and unskilled workers who would only be granted short-term visas in sectors with skills shortages.The Prime Ministers official spokesman also said it was unlikely that UK ministers would engage with the Scottish Government on the issue. \"Were very clear that we want an immigration system that works for the whole UK,\" the spokesman said. \"Immigration policy is a matter for the UK Government.\"Today the First Minister admitted her government had not yet entered into discussions with the Home Office about how a \"tailored\" approach to Scottish immigration could work, but it had been \"touched on\" when they pair had met last summer. \"We will be seeking to intensy that now we have published these proposals,\" she said.She added that her proposals were necessary to address Scotlands depopulation - it has the lowest fertility rate in the UK - and to tackle skills gaps in the wake of Brexit.It is predicted thatEU migration to the UK is halved the UK population would still grow by . per cent over the next  years, but the Scottish population would only increase by one per cent. It has also been estimated that Scottish GDP could by . per cent lower by  as a result of lower migration compared to . per cent across the UK as a whole.Ms Sturgeon said that the figures proved the \"urgent need\" to ensure immigration continued to Scotland. She said under the current constitutional arrangements, she wanted responsibility for immigration policy split with the UK government. Migrants who want to live and work in Scotland could choose to apply for a Scottish Visa, with residing in Scotland and maintaining a Scottish tax code the main requirements. They could also still apply through one of the UK immigration routes.However, when asked how she could ensure that people applying for a Scottish Visa would remain in Scotland and not move where in the UK, she said the only tracking measure would be the Scottish tax code.: SNP set to unveil ‘Scottish visa’ plan to combat Brexit\"We already have the infrastructure here as part of the devolution of income tax,\" she said. \"Often - and m not saying its completely wrong - but often we take the view of immigration which starts out with the assumption that \"theyre at it\" and want to abuse the system, but thats not the case for the vast majority of people who want to come here to get a job, to stay and contribute and raise their families and that should be our starting point.\"Yes we can have discussions about what we do with the minority of cases where that might be dferent, but having that Scottish tax code as the building block is the most signicant part. Part of it is also shting our mindset and our perspective - the numbers of people who come to try and abuse the system are actually very small and we cannot allow the system to be driven by that as perhaps has been the case for too long.\"Later, when pressed on the issue again, she added: \"Of course there are points of detail to be worked through but there is nothing that is insurmountable in thistheres the political will there to do it. HMRC already operate the Scottish tax code and its up to HMRC as a government agency to implement government policies, but they would not be policing it.\"Ms Sturgeon saida migrants job came to end within the time of their Visa they wouldnt automatically have to leave Scotland, but details like that would be dealt with \"in the system design\".\"We dont start from the point of people coming to game the system, thats not the reality of people coming to work here. We dont design a system catering for the exception rather than the rule,\" she said.Asked about whether there would be a cap on immigration numbers, given the policy paper suggests quotas could be set by agreement between the UK and Scottish governments, she said: \"I dont favour arbitrary targets around immigration, we need to be able to attract what we need for the needs of the country and thats the starting point.\"We have deliberately designed this paper to open up the discussion about the detail of how this will work within a UK framework. We are willing to consult on these things, thats leaving open as much room for discussion as possible - my starting point is I dont favour arbitrary targets, butgetting to a point where a Scottish visa is to be agreed by the UK government requires some discussion around that Im open to having that discussion. Were trying very hard to leave as much open to discussion as possible.\"One of the driving factors has to be the population statistics, what do we need to do to stop our population going into decline  And there are also regional requirements - there are parts of our country, rural areas in particular, and part industry requirements as well, sectors like tourism and hospitality who have specic needs, My in-principle position is arbitrary targets and quotas get in the way of that.\": Scotland should get its own ‘distinct’ immigration rules under new pilotThe First Minister said that inward migration had to be improved to ensure the sustainability of rural communities, as did \"transport and digital infrastructures\". She added: \"Theres a whole suite of things that we have to do alongside this [immigration], but the overall trends in our population mean thatwe close off or substantially reduce the supply of people coming in from other countries then we will make it dficult to keep our population growing and that will have a disproportionate impact on rural communities.\"Ms Sturgeon also said she was aware there would be some \"concern\" about immigration in Scotland, but said it was her \"duty to level with people\" about why it was necessary.She added: \"I dont think this is an easy thing for politicians, its not always a pain-free subject for politicians. ButI were not to make the case for immigration at best, or go along with anti-immigration rhetoric at worst, then Im doing that knowing it would have real, damaging impact on Scotlands prosperity and it wouldnt be the right thing to do, and politicians should argue for the right thing evenits dficult. Its also too easy to over-estimate the concern, I think theres a much greater awareness in Scotland of why this is important.\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish parliament to back indyref2 this week as nicola sturgeon sets out next steps","story":"Nicola Sturgeon will this week call on the Scottish Parliament to backa referendum on Scottish independence being staged this year in a landmark vote.The motion being brought before MSPs is poised to be approved by the pro-independence majority of SNP and Green MSPs.  But the move has been branded a \"waste of time\" by pro-union opponents.The First Minister will also set out the \"next steps\" in her push for a repeat of the  referendum on Friday, the day the UK leaves the European Union.The SNP leader’s speech on Brexit daywill be followed by SNP figures attending community events and \"vigils\" around the country to mark Scotland’sexit from the European Union.Ms Sturgeon said today: “Friday will be a sad day for Scotland as we are taken out of the European Union against our will.“While the impacts on business and citizens may not be immediate, there is no doubt that from pm on Friday st January there will have been a material change in Scotland’s circumstances against the wishes of the vast majority of people in Scotland.“It will also be clear that a future in Europe can only be achieved by Scotland becoming an independent country – and it is hope of a better future that must now be our focus. This week I will ask Parliament to endorse the mandate the people have given us to put the question of Scotland’s future back to them in a new public vote.“On Friday, I will then set out the next steps as we continue the campaign to secure Scotland’s future as an independent nation.”On Friday and over the weekend, in a break from protocol, the European flag will fly from the Scottish Governments St Andrews House HQ.Scots voted decisivelyin favour of remaining in the EU in the  Brexit vote, but the weight of votes south of the border swung the result in favour of LeaveMs Sturgeon will give a speech on Friday to mark Scotland being taken out of the EU \"against our will\"and setting out the next steps in the campaign to secure a referendum.The UK Government has control over the constitution and Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this month refused Ms Sturgeons request for a transfer of power which would allow a referendum to be staged.Constitutional Affairs Secretary Mike Russell will update parliament on Thursday on whether agreement has been reached on Scotland’s involvement in the next phase of Brexit negotiations. The Scottish Government will also relaunch “Hey Europe” in countries across the EU to encourage European citizens to continue to visit, work and live in Scotland. The motion to be debated and voted on by MSPs on Wednesday agrees there has been a \"material change in circumstances since  and that a referendum should be held so that the people of Scotland can decidethey wish to become an independent country.\"It also calls on the UK Government to \"reach an agreement with the Scottish Government on such a referendum taking place on a date and in a manner determined by the Scottish Parliament, and which the Scottish Government proposes should take place in .\"But Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: “This motion is a waste of valuable parliamentary time which could instead be used to address the crisis in Scotland’s health boards, the chaos in our education system, or the SNP’s cuts to local public services.“Instead, Nicola Sturgeon is engaged in a pointless exercise that may well have the support of SNP and Green MSPs, but goes against the wishes of the vast majority of people in Scotland. “Barely a quarter of people in Scotland want a isive second independence referendum this year.“The SNP should get on with the job it was elected to do.

If a situation occurs outside anticipated parameters then electronic control can be useless. Aircraft have landed in the wrong place and landed unexpectedly at Sumburgh. In such circumstance everyone is safer when the situation is within view of a live controller in the airport tower. Such a lookout may also assist aircraft in dficulties, and react tovandalism and other hazardous outbreaks.They should do away with all that glass windows in the control tower as well as all the windows in control towers all over the world as they are clearly not needed. All can be done by looking at a computer screen.Any body with any sense knows there is no requirement to look in the sky, or on the runway or at the weather to see for yourself what is going on.If HIAL are determined to go ahead with this, perhaps there should be a #trial# period, of say at least a minimum of one year.Instead of just installing all the cameras and whatever other gubbins is supposed to make this work, feeding it down the phone line and hoping for the best. Why not pull down the blinds in the tower here and give the local controllers the same monitor screens to look at as they#re intending to use remotely to operate from instead. Meanwhile, also send the data to Inverness, and have them monitor and log on how many occasions and for what duration the data received is either interrupted or of inadequate quality.If the system is as resilient as HIAL claim, they have nothing to worry about or hide, the local controllers will have no complaints about using monitors instead of looking out the window, there will have been no data interruptions to Inverness, and any deterioration in data quality will have been minimal. However,serious shortcomings are evident, a controller only needs to raise the blind to regain actual vision and immediately rescue a situation.Bosses say their communications system has been affected, and that engineers are on the scene working to remedy the situation.# Well, that#s OK then.

No film-maker has documented UK society as forensically as Ken Loach. The desperation that comes from poverty, the bad choices that often seem like the only choices available, are his stock-in-trade. ‘Sorry We Missed You’ is another compelling exemplar of what the man is all about.Marriedparents Ricky and Abbie did all the right things. They followed the rules andworked hard and were on the brink of becoming homeowners when the Northern Rockbuilding society collapsed, taking their dreams with it. Now mired in debt, theyare shunted from one shabby rental to another along with surly son Seb andsmart daughter Liza Jane.Ricky’sskills are no longer in demand. Even though he is a “grafter” who has doneevery job under the sun, proper jobs – with set hours, agreeable conditions, anda decent wage – are like hen’s teeth.

He is in thehot seat this week, speaking to us about his love of music and choosing his top ten tracks - not an easy task by any means.Vincent enjoys a busy family le AND has five children and five grandchildren.He is a finance and property expert, and in his spare time helps out as a quiz master, which keeps him sharp!However music has always been a big part of his le, and he has had an interest in it since he was only a boy.“Music is a passion and something that has followed me since childhood,” explained Vincent.He confesses that his top  favourite songs are constantly changing, so when revealing his list, he decided to focus on a top  that brings back the strongest memories for him throughout his le.At number one is the Beach Boys with ‘God Only knows’.“This was released in  off the incredible Pet Sounds album. “Although I didn’t discover it until my teens, this is an enduring song of beauty.” Number two on his list is ‘The Long and Winding Road’ from The Beatles.He said: “It’s impossible not to have a Beatles track in here. This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks! Vincent admits these “are not necessarily my favourite ever songs as the list changes constantly, but they certainly contain my strongest and fondest memories from down through the years.

While he still enjoys the banter over the counter on a daily basis, hes made himself a local social media personality with his popular posts ranging from the daily headlines to his chatter sparking reminiscences about the confectionery of yesteryear. Editor Des Blackadder sat down with Eugene this week to hear just some of the stories he has to tell after four decades in his Broughshane Street shop.You could say that Eugene Diamond got his start in the newspaper industry and hes been associated with it for most of his adult le.Born in the late s in a long demolished row of mill workers cottages in James Street in Harryville, Eugene is one of nine children - three girls and six boys. Which must have been a tight fit in the James Street days.I was a baby when the family got a move to the houses in the Demesne Estate, just across the Braid River from Harryville. If you ask me I would say it was perfect place to grow up .. we had the ruins of a castle literally at the top of our estate and a forest pretty much on our doorstep!The neighbours were great people and there were lots of children growing up in the Demesne at the time. We used to have great fun making huts up in the woods - which we called the forest - just beside the old Intermediate School site. One of my best memories is making a hut under the pedestrian bridge over the Braid which led to the Ballykeel One estate - we could hear the people walking across above our heads and we thought we were some boys because they didnt know we were there! Innocent days indeed, laughs Eugene.There was no easy pocket money in those days so Eugene had to earn his by delivering newspapers around the sprawling Ballykeel Two estate which had been constructed in the late s.That was my first job in the newspaper business, recalls Eugene. I got the job with the late Tam Johnston who had premises at what used to be known as the Ballykeel One shops. He was a gentleman and his shop will be well remembered by the older generation around Ballykeel and Harryville.Having attended St Patricks High School, Eugenes first real job took him to the Murphys Bottling Plant which was sited just off Railway Street in Harryville.Always on the look out for an extra few quid, Eugene took on a weekend job serving in a clothes shop in the centre of Ballymena.That was me into the retail sector - and it was a great time to be in the clothing trade. A guy called Brian Close owned the shop which was called In-Gear. It was just at the corner of Bryan Street and Church Street - the same building occupied until recently by David Bellingham.Things went well and he offered me the post of manager so I left Murphys for good.It was an era of glam rock, outrageous stars and some outright fashion disasters.Top of the Pops more or less set the style. When the Bay City Rollers hit the heights their tartan striped half mast trousers and skinny college style jumpers were huge sellers especially with the girls.Most guys round Ballymena were pretty much content with a pair of jeans, a gingham shirt and a Shetland wool jumper. Younger lads wore a lot of Wrangler denim known locally as the Wrangler suit of jacket and skinner half mast jeans.I remember the night that David Essex appeared on Top of the Pops wearing a grandad shirt - the next day there was a huge demand for the style, we couldnt get enough of them!Bryan Ferry more or less brought the elegant suit back into fashion when he and Roxy Music made a comeback just after the punk era had faded. Guys all wanted the double-breasted suit with turn-up trousers at the time, he recalls.Eugene chuckles when I ask him about the fashion disasters he encountered.I sold an awful lot of velvet jackets at a time, he recalls. Black, blue, bottle green. They were very popular but I bet the guys who bought them wonder why when they look back.Then there was the parallel suit - I can remember the favourite colour was electric blue. Basically it was a sports coat worn with matching extra width trousers. You could have sailed the Atlantic with themyoud nailed them to a mast!But denim was, without doubt, the major seller in Ballymena and a controversial advert for one particular brand meant that Eugene found himself in the eye of a publicity storm which made headlines far and wide.In those days dferent shops were linked to a certain brand - for example Sam of Sams Boutique had what was effectively the Wrangler dealershipI remember. Edwin Maternaghan was another big name in fashion retailing locally and he had Brutus.By now the name of In-Gear had been changed to Bananas Boutique and we were selling Easy Jeans and a new product called Jesus Jeans.They had a full colour poster of a well-proportioned lady squeezed into a pair of Jesus Jeans with the slogan He who loves me, follows me. We put it up in the window and it was a marmite job - people either loved it or hated it! One religious group based out in the country started a petition about it so we started a counter petition in the shop.It was the time when Ballymena couldnt appear in a news story without the words Bible Belt being added on - around the same time you had the ELO showgrounds story making headlines too.While Eugene enjoyed the fun times at Bananas, he can well remember one of Ballymenas worst days of devastation during the troubles when Church Street was blown to smithereens by an IRA bomb.It was on Friday, May ,  and I remember I was chatting to a friend outside the shop when a police car raced up and an officer told us to clear the area because there was a bomb in a post office van parked in the street. I had got round to Wellington Street and was talking to my good friend journalist Lyle McMullan.I said to him theres a story for you and because there were so many bomb hoaxes in those days he replied onlyit goes off.With that the lower end of Church Street just lted. Ive never felt or seen anything like it before or since. It was a scene of utter devastation which people who lived through it will never forget. One of my vivid memories is how dficult it was to get re-opened - the shop had very distinctive rounded windows and it took a long time to get new glass  made by Pilkingtons. And of course a lot of people will remember the bomb damage sales which took place in the aftermath.When Bananas closed its doors in , Eugene reckoned it was time for a change of direction and when he came across a small shop for rent in Upper Broughshane Street he decided to take the plunge. It was called the First and last because it was the first shop on the way into town and, coversely, the last as you were going out!I had started off delivering papers as a wee boy and now I found myself in behind the counter of a paper shop, he said.”My first rent payment was pound a week.”Forty years later hes still loving the job - despite a horrying early .am start!Sure its only seven days a week, laughs Eugene.In those  years, Eugene has witnessed the high points of the newspaper market when titles like News of the World sold by the barrow load.You couldnt explain to todays generation just how huge the NOTW actually was. People might have bought the quality Sundays but they also bought the NOTW eventhey did tuck it inside the Sunday Times! Of course they were caught out in some abysmal practices and that cant be forgiven but they did break some enormously important stories too. I still have some NOTW publicity material on a side wall of the shop. It may well be the last such material still on display in Britain but I keep it there to remind of just how big the newspaper print industry was at the time.But selling papers was only part of Eugenes role and he was a past master at stirring up some publicity out of all proportion to the size of his tiny shop.Back in the early s I took a punt on getting my own Ballymena Rock made up by a firm in Newry. People thought I had lost the plot because everyone associated rock with seaside resorts and not a town like Ballymena. Thankfully local people loved the idea and I had a great sale on it. Quite a few bars were sent overseas too, he laughs.The ieties of sweets and chocolate bars Eugene has sold down through the years is staggering.In fact, Ive come to the conclusion that people here have the sweetest tooth in the world! If you want to start a debate in Ballymena all you have to do is ask someone what their favourite sweet of all time was.Im a diabetic so I dont do many sweets but I have a good knowledge of wnhat the public wants and to this day people will travel from all over the country to buy a certain brand of toffee or an old style boiled sweet which I stock. Sweets especially are memory jerkers and they have tremendous nostalgia value. If it gets people talking and laughing sure its a good thing. How many times have I heard stories about someone losing a filling to the old Rileys Toffee Rolls  And yet they still came back for more!And does he have a personal favourite Cinnamon Lozenges all the way, he says. As far as I know they are more or less an Irish-only sweet because people come in all the time and take away a few bags full to friends and family in other parts of the world.Talking about local flavours, Eugene says he still has regulars who come specically for the bottled minerals.You would not believe the number of people who still swear by Kali water! And the younger generation will have absolutely no idea wnat Kali Water is but older people will probably be remembering the day they took a drink of it by mistake.If digital technology is our pathway to the future then it is a time machine which works both ways and Eugenes nostalgia posts about old sweets on social media have been delighting the local public for the past few years.As one who was steeped in newspapers I was a latecomer to twitter and facebook but time waits for no man so I decided to embrace it. To be honest Ive had some great fun thanks to social media. People love the old pictures of products and just love to tell you their stories of why they loved a particular brand more than others, says Eugene.The recognition by the National Lottery reflects sales which have raised more than pound. million for good causes down through the years. As one of the last old style newsagents the award is well deserved and theextends its best wishes to Eugene as he embarks on his st year in the trade.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"register now for the craic 10k st","story":"BELFAST’S First Citizen was onhand to officially launch the annual SPAR Craic K.Set to kick-start St Patrick’s Day celebrations on March , thousands of runners are set to take part in the urban run which is celebrating its sixth year.Lord Mayor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that he will counting down the race as runners go through their paces.“I will be starting the race and as much as I would love to take part I have a sore knee at the minute and that’s my excuse,” he laughed. “This is a huge event for the city and I’m delighted that a portion of the funds raised will go towards Marie Curie cancer charity.

Paul Duffy, chief executive of the Driver and Vehicle Agency , said in a statement last night that following further inspections of lt faults at MoT centres, the contractor had not provided sufficient assurances on the effectiveness of the ongoing repairs.Tests on heavy good vehicles and buses will continue.Anyone scheduled for a car or light vehicle MoT today has been told not to attend.Mr Duffy said the “precautionary measure” had been taken to ensure the health and safety of staff and customers.Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon held an urgent meeting with officials this evening in relation to the matter.The DVA has said that all customers, except customers with four-year-old vehicles and taxis, will be automatically issued an MoT exemption certicate and therefore can continue to drive.The exemption will be recorded in the DVA system and a hard copy will arrive by post in the coming days.Mr Duffy said: “For customers with four-year-old vehicles and taxis, we are working to urgently find a solution to get these vehicles through MOT and will contact customers directly.“The DVA will issue a further statement as a matter of urgency to advise these customers and those who have MoTs booked for later this week. We want to advise customers that more cancellations are very likely.“The DVA recognises the considerable inconvenience and disruption this will cause for many people and sincerely apologises that it has been unable to recty this situation more quickly.“Given the urgency of this situation, we are asking the public to follow media, social media channels and nidirect for updates. Staff will also be kept fully informed by their centre managers.”Earlier, Ms Mallon had refused to saycompensation will be provided to those affected by cancelled MoT tests to pay for hire cars.She was also unable to give a timeframe as to when the situation will be resolved, but said she was taking steps to ensure it would not happen again.Around , tests have already been cancelled after signs of cracking were uncovered in  of  vehicle lts at MoT centres across Northern Ireland.Inspections and repairs are currently being carried out, with Ms Mallon issuing temporary four-month exemptions to affected drivers. Those who had an appointment cancelled will also be refunded half of the test fee and given a free test.Askedcompensation will be paid out to drivers who have to hire a car due to their MoT certicate expiring as a result of a cancelled test, the minister said she was restricted in what she could do. “I have to operate within the legislation and I absolutely understand the disruption that’s been caused to people. You mentioned people that are working class and are struggling to make ends meet — that’s why I got into politics,” she told BBC Radio Ulster’s Nolan Show.“In term of compensation, I have to operate within the legislation, this is public money. “I have considered compensation, but what are the parameters  What are the thresholds  What are the criteria  We get into a very dficult area.” Ms Mallon said she first became aware of the problem last Tuesday when she was told of one faulty vehicle lt. On Wednesday she was told  lts had been taken out of operation. She moved to issue exemptions within  hours.The exemption, however, does not apply to four-year-old cars, as they have never been issued with an MoT certicate, although they will be prioritised, alongside taxis.“I’m restricted in what I can do for taxi drivers, as they are subject to a PSV licence,” she added."},{"url":null,"title":"phantom planter on a mission to cover northern ireland with trees","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Read MoreSinn Fein policy is decided by a cabal and TDs have no say, ex-member claimsThey did draw down their salaries, though, because they felt they deserved the money after creating such an ideal society with all the funding they received from the EU, the Tories and the Northern Ireland taxpayer.Unfortunately, Northern Ireland is far from an ideal society and Sinn Fein does not have a lot to be proud of when it comes to two decades of power-sharing. Take a recent report by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission which found more than a quarter of the UKs recent homeless deaths happened in Northern Ireland. The report found a shocking  homeless people died in Northern Ireland over an -month period.Chief commissioner Les Allamby said the absence of the Executive for the past three years had taken its toll. \"Rising poverty and homeless figures in Northern Ireland give cause for much concern,\" Mr Allamby said. Try as you may, you wont find a statement from Sinn Feins housing spokesperson Eoin O Broin condemning this indictment of his party colleagues. Sinn Fein also tell us they are the only ones who can fix the Republics health crisis so you would be forgiven for believing patients in Northern Ireland can walk into a hospital at any given time and be treated on the spot in their own private room. The , people waiting longer than a year for a hospital appointment in Northern Ireland will tell you otherwise. And they are only a third of the , people waiting for their first appointment with a specialist.When Northern Irelands figures were published in December, Mark Jones from the Royal College of Surgeons said: \"Northern Irelands healthcare system is at the point of collapse.\"Again, Sinn Feins health spokesperson Louise OReilly did not see fit to issue a statement calling for a health emergency to be declared. She couldnt have called for the Health Minister to resign because there was none. Three years earlier, the last Health Minister was none other than Sinn Fein vice president Michelle ONeill, who has gone on to bigger and better things.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

We don’t.“The reason why Sinn Fein have opposed the Offences Against the State Act and the Special Criminal Court year after year since they came into the Dail is because the Provisionals within their movement wouldn’t allow them to vote for it.“That’s it, the old provos hate the Special Criminal Court. Why  Because the Special Criminal Court defeated the Provisional IRA in the Republic. Let’s call a spade a spade.”Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin said he would not rule any party out of coalition, describing that as “arrogant”.“After this election we could have a block of  TDs that would include the Social Democrats and People Before Profit,” he said.“There is very little we disagree on,we had critical mass we could form a progressive government.”People Before Profit candidate Richard Boyd-Barrett hit out at the Labour Party for “imposing crippling austerity” on the Irish people the last time it was in a coalition government with Fine Gael.Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said the future of politics and society will be dferent but it will require “radical change”.He said he would not rule out working with any particular party as every group has a duty to deal with the climate crisis.Social Democrats leader Roisin Shortall said no-one has the right to veto who they will or will not go into government with.She said: “There is a responsibility on all government parties to work together to address the huge societal issues we face and reach solutions to the health service, the housing crisis and climate change.“It is wrong to say we will not work with this person or that person.”The two-hour live debate also saw leaders clash on housing, the Garda, taxation policies, health and the pension age.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, meet outside the Government Buildings in Dublin.

think its a subject that needs analysis, but theres also the major benefits of homework, whereby parents are able to monitor the progressJoe McHugh, Education Minister“It’s an interesting conversation because there are questions around stress, around pressure,” he added.“There are a lot of parents who commute and they have to go home and sit down and do the homework and that can be stressful.“I think it’s a subject that needs analysis, but there’s also the major benefits of homework, whereby parents are able to monitor the progress.“Most schools have one opportunity through a parent-teacher meeting, soyou are making any changes you would probably have more than one parent-teacher meeting.“I just believe that there is value in homework and it’s also what type of homework.“There’s this notion that homework is just a drudgery but homework from my own personal insight is that young people are doing research, it’s project work, they’re using dferent data and that’s at a primary school level.“The debate has to start with the young people.“It’s an area that will require the parents’ voice and students’ voice before any minister or leader of any party stands up and says ‘this should happen’ or ‘this should not happen’.”We will establish a long-term funding model for higher and further education on the basis of it not raising registration feesMary Mitchell OConnor, Minister for

“starving” universities of funding.She ruled out increasing registration fees and introducing a student loan scheme, adding that the budget was . billion euro last year.“We will establish a long-term funding model for higher and further education on the basis of it not raising registration fees,” she added.“We will not increase registration fees and one of the reasons is because it makes no sense because many universities across the world do not charge for registration fees, so we do not want our students leaving our country.“We will continue to increase public funding and will ensure that extra funding provides more student places and a better student experience.“We will increase the SUSIgrant by % on the income threshold for the grant and that will ensure that more students will be able to avail of third level places.”She also said she is against the decriminalisation of drugs, including “soft” and “hard” drugs.“I’m a former school principal, I’m a mother and a grandmother, and

At least the important decisions are not made by TDs,” he said. “TDs and staff gather on a weekly basis, but the staff would have as much say with regards the direction of policy.”He said he knew of one TD who was effectively directed to make Dail speeches by her assistant, as she did not agree with the policy.

However, after the discussion they were told what the party position was.“The decision was obviously pre-written before the TDs had asked to have a discussion so at that point it was quite clear to me that my influence as a TD representing the people of Meath was pretty much zero,” he said. “Sometimes you’d be in meetings and you’d feel like everyone was talking from textbooks and those who spoke outside of the textbook were frowned upon,” he added.He said paid organisers have too much power over the organisation and regularly seek to influence the outcome of internal elections. He said organisers regularly tell cumanns who to vote for ahead of elections and also seek to influence the outcome of motions being voted on by local branches. “When you have paid organisers mobilising membership in a certain direction, that radically skews the outcome of an election,” he said. Mr Toibin said he was told to vote against the party’s housing spokesperson Eoin O Broin when he put his name forward for the Sinn Fein secretary general contest. He also highlighted the fact that Sinn Fein MLA John O’Dowd was denied an opportunity to address the membership when he ran against Michelle O’Neill for deputy leader. He said he always pushed for a “less hierarchical” decision-making structure when he was in the party but was only supported by a few of his colleagues including Mr O Broin and Waterford TD David Cullinane. “When I founded Aontu, the objective was actually to flip that around and make it a grassroots, people-powered organisation where actually the members drove the direction of the party,” he said. Sinn Fein did not respond to requests for comment. Meanwhile, Mr Toibin was forced to withdraw a High Court action seeking to be included in last night’s Irish general election leadership debate on RTE because there was not enough time to hear his case.Mr Toibin said it was “frustrating” that the broadcaster excluded his party after they polled higher than the Social Democrats and People Before Profit in the recent by-elections. “We are very radical compared to establishment politics and we believe there is a herd mentality in Leinster House and we are probably the only political party challenging that,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"kate stresses importance of telling holocaust story to children","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, DUP Alderman for the area, David Ramsey, has welcomed the commencement of demolition work at the site and he believes a boundary and fencing offers enough protection. Radius Housing Association submitted an application in May  to construct forty-nine residential units with associated landscape and access works on the site of the former Ebrington Primary School. The application is currently under consideration with a view to bringing it before Derry City  Strabane District Council’s Planning Committee at the “earliest opportunity”, a council spokesperson confirmed. googletag.cmd.push The site has lain vacant since Ebrington P.S. relocated to a new site on the Limavady Road in . In that time there have been issues with anti-social behaviour and the building was badly damaged in two arson attacks. The planned housing development is situated in a backland site between the Limavady Road and Rossdowney Road on lands south of Glendermott Cricket Club. Documents associated with the application show that the Council’s Environmental Health Service has raised concerns about the possibility of cricket balls struck at the Glendermott C.C. ground landing in the housing development - particularly when professional players are batting as they can hit the ball a greater distance. googletag.cmd.push Each team in the league is permitted the use of one professional overseas player and up to  competitive games at first class cricket level could also be played during the season. The document states: “It is recognised that cricket balls can travel a distance of up to .m and within the proposed development. Cricket balls that travel a distance more than .m will therefore land within the development boundary and on the roadway. “Such cricket balls will not stop dead but will have sufficient momentum to travel a further distance with the potential to strike adjacent property, vehicles and pedestrians. “Therefore, it is anticipated that the overall frequency of first class standard play with the ability to hit a ball up to . metres and the potential to cause damage to property persons has increased beyond that stated in the GM Design risk assessment.”  Much-needed DUP Alderman for the Waterside area, David Ramsey, welcomed progress towards construction at the site. He said: “At long last the demolition has begun, Glendermott CC and the surrounding community will be delighted. The site should be cleared by February and as far as I’m aware Radius is ready to move in and start work. “This now means progress on the much needed affordable housing and improved green space will be commencing soon. “Many people have great memories of this building, end of an era and making way for a new beginning.” Cllr Ramsey went on to explain that he and other party representatives have been “inundated” with housing related issues from constituents. The Waterside area is in need of  bungalows to meet the current demand with many elderly and disabled residents in search of single-storey houses. Glendermott Cricket Club is also pleased that it will get ground back that was taken away when the former school was built, Cllr Ramsey added. New residents moving into the area could also prove positive in terms of recruiting new members to the club.

They faded and after a briefthey disappeared again. But now they are back, building from the foundations up. Club PRO Paddy McCann spoke to Michael McMullan, to trace their steps back into the world of club hurling. As a new decade turned earlier this month, Slaughtneil took the aristocrats of club hurling – Ballyhale Shamrocks – to the pin of their collar. Following the dramatic conclusion to an equally epic encounter, the Emmets narrowly missed out on qualication for Sundays All-Ireland final. But it was the subplot that struck an equally loud chord across Ulster. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Ballyhales players and their iconic manager Henry Shefflin were swamped by fans in search of autographs and selfies. A genuine outpouring of passion mixed with adoration. The glee etched across youngsters faces spoke volumes. In the recent past, its, perhaps, the biggest sign that the pockets of hurling across Ulster are alive and well. Bursting to get out. Witnessing it first hand was inspiring. Last November , another Kilkenny icon was in Ulster. It was a dferent brief entirely. Martin Fogarty coached many of the hurlings greatest. But in his role as hurlings National Development Manager, he was up in Drummullan to present medals to the underage players of St Finbarrs hurling club. googletag.cmd.push Two years after theirfrom the hurling wilderness, the clubs U team won the Ulster shield. They now unveil their plans for registration evenings later this month, giving Irelands national game another opportunity to spread its wings. And in the north of the county, Claudy are putting their roots down in search of another success story. For St Finbarrs, they have a heritage. In the late s hurling was played in the Loup area before the club was formed around the turn of the s. Of the three county finals they competed in the took the title in  and . They had quality players in brothers Liam and Colm Hinphey. John James McPeake, Sean and Francie Smith, M and Brian Mitchell. Patsy Donnelly. Joe McKee. S McGrogan. Henry McGlone. They also had Cork man Pat Russell in their ranks, who hailed from a club of the same name on Leeside. After the initial burst, St Finbarrs disappeared. It reformed later for a short time in the early eighties but ran out of steam before the newest dawn, when the wheels were set in motion for the club as it currently exists. Kilkenny man Brian Waldron, from Freshford, married Sheila Devlin and in recent years they settled in her native Loup. Their sons Odraacuten, Cian and Naoise hurled with Cuala and won Nicky Rackard Cup medals with Derry two years ago.   In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back. Paddy McCann  Brian, now the St Finbarrs Chairman, has hurling in his blood. He was involved with Kilkenny minors in the early noughties and, since histo Derry, has been coaching in seven of the local schools in the Loup area...spreading the gospel. The interest morphed into an informal meeting in January , that included Derrys Regional Hurling Development Officer Kevin Hinphey and Dunloy native Seamus Kane, who now resides in Loup. Kevins father Liam was part of the  St Finbarrs winning team. “Brian went around the local schools coaching and developed an appetite for hurling,” recalls St Finbarrs PRO Paddy McCann, one of the six at that initial meeting. “There was a group of us there at the start. Niall Lagan was there as well, his father also played on the  St Finbarrs team.” And so it began. Following Ogra Colmcilles withdrawal from the Derry junior league, they reached out to St Finbarrs, offering their premises base to help them build an identity. They are indebted to Ogra and to St Patricks PS Loup, where they host meetings. “The first night at Drummullan, it was like the build it and they will come sort of idea,” explains McCann of the new dawn in May . “We didnt really know who was going to turn up and when they called itthere was the guts of  youngsters...it was fantastic.” Now the club has over  members with  playing junior members. The players come from a iety of parishes in the South Derry and Loughshore area. The formation of the club has ensured access to hurling for all children in the area. It began with Us and earlier this month that cohort, mainly still Us, fielded the clubs first U team. “We would be expecting to field at U, U and at the younger ages. In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back,” McCann adds. “That would have been from Us, Us, Us, Us and down to Us.” Their growth has been helped by Brian Waldrons brainchild, the St Finbarrs Cup. A tournament played between the schools within their catchment area. Some field two teams, with eight or nine players in each. Its all about participation. “It is part of Brians work going around the schools, he organises it in Meadowbank and all the schools he was at would come in and play,” McCann explains. “It feeds into all the schools and for anyone showing promise and an interest, we can get them to play for St Finbarrs.” The Us and Us have had the privilege of playing at Croke Park in Go Games for the last two years. The youngsters are competing well and are going from strength to strength. The club achieved their first on field victory in October , when they won the Ulster U Regional Shield played against very competitive Letterkenny and Slaughtneil sides at Dungivens Kevin Lynch Park. At the presentation night, Martin Fogarty offered advice to carry on into this season, as they strive to grow. He emphasised the pride the club should take in passing on skills to the children and promoting hurling in the area. They had a blueprint for others to tap in to. “He spoke well about the club and he said he had heard about us,” McCann recalls of Fogartys address on the night. “Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example for other clubs.” Already this year, St Finbarr’s has made further strides with entry in the U North West indoor league. They have also entered teams into the U U Tain Oacuteg regional leagues run by Croke Park, as well as U league and Feacuteile. In their recent historic debut at U level, they gave a good account of themselves in a blitz that included Tyrone clubs Naomh Colmcille, Fintona, Belnaleck of Fermanagh and Dungloe. All with a  back-boned by Us. In any club, the people are the real assets. St Finbarrs are no dferent. Kevin Hinphey and Colm Dillon helped steer the coaching in the early days. The club described the input as immense but now the aim is to become self-sufficient. “Seamusand Brianare great for bringing people in. At our AGM, there were people volunteering that never played hurling to get doing coaching courses in it. “There is a lot of good will and parents are really buying into it. Some of the people are not really from GAA backgrounds.” It ensures that the future looks bright and their door is open to all new coaches and players, of all abilities. Everyone is welcome and there is always something to aspire to. Two years ago, three of the clubs U players represented Derry at half-time in their game with Down in the Christy Ring Cup. “They are holding their own. You would know they have started a few years later than other clubs but their skill levels are coming up,” McCann explains of how their oldest underage stars have progressed.   Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example. Paddy McCann  “There are a couple of guys and their skill levels are right up there with what other clubs have. We just dont have enough yet to be competing across the team but I can see them moving right up.” A club with championship tradition dating back to the s is back on the map. With continued efforts and promotion, maintaining their drive towards U and adult hurling is a target. As well as getting players through to Derrys Celtic Challenge team...and further. It would signy payback on a bigger scale and a chance for their club to grow further. For now, the Gaels in this corner of the county will continue to raise the bar. St Finbarrs registration for the  season takes place in Meadowbank on Tuesday, January  and Tuesday, February  at ..

He was always destined for success. His mother Catriona is an Ulster and All-Ireland champions camogie player, before moving into coaching where titles also streamed in her direction. Garys father Ronnie and grandfather George are steeped in motorbikes. On a dferent tangent, his sister Lara is both a champion gymnast and trampolinist. Sport simply runs in the family. For the  year-old St Patricks Maghera pupil, he has excelled in the world of motorsport despite only going into his third season in the saddle. Gary has competed on the Irish minibike circuit since its inception in , finishing second in the junior class, before graduating to the senior ranks last season. googletag.cmd.push In recent weeks, he was awarded the prestigious David Wood scholarship which the Motorcycle Union of Ireland awards to its most promising rider. It was won for the first time in  by Lee Johnston, winner of the last seasons Junior Isle of Man TT winner. He also took on the role of IMC Youth Ambassador – to act as a role-model for our younger members. “During this time Gary has shown maturity beyond his years, building up a great rapport with our Junior Members and his peers,” commented IMC Chairman Mark Boyd. “In addition to his abilities as a competitor, his positive attitude in success or defeat coupled with the clear commitment shown by both Gary and his family to his budding racing career bode well for his future. googletag.cmd.push “As Chairman of The Irish Minibike Championship I am privileged to recommend Gary for inclusion in the  BTC and wish him every success with the selection process.” His mothers reluctance stalled Garys career until just before his th birthday but she is now fully behind him since his early short circuit days. In , he progressed to the IMC Senior Open and Ulster Superbike Moto Championship. “Last year he was doing pit bikes with young kids but this year he went on to the short circuits and he was racing against adults, when he won the Moto championship,” Catriona said. “Now he is hoping to go to the British Superbikes on a Moto as well.” “As a rookie in the USBK Moto Championship, against some very experienced and older riders I came away with the title USBK Moto Champion ,” Gary outlined in his CV, which has been compiled with the view to attracting sponsorship for this season and a shot at the Moto class. The costings for next season could amount to over poundk, including a pound, Honda NSFR bike, entry fees and travel. “At the end of next year my aim is to make a wildcard into the Spanish Championship with my future dream to ride in the World Championships,” Gary added. He grew up watching and supporting both his father and grandfather in action on both the circuits and roads. It was no surprise to see him emerge from their shadows. His family helped him raise the funds for a trip to Donnington to compete in a round of the British Superbikes to help gather invaluable experience and a taste of what  could bring. MCUI Trainer and respected journalist and photographer Baylon McCaughey was full of praise for Gary. “Despite the cold and wet weather Gary, despite having only one season of tarmac racing under his belt in Pit Bike Racing, showed great enthusiasm and certainly was not afraid to ask questions,” he said. “After each session, he would enquire,he was doing the correct thing or not, and listened to advice given. “With plans to compete in the British Championships, I know this lad has the correct approach to his racing, his manners off the track, and competitiveness on the track, will certainly help him to achieve his goals.” Talent, with an attitude to match. Perhaps the greatest combination. If the next two years follow his meteoric rise since , Gary Scott is destined for greatness. Remember the name.

Lyndon Stephens died that morning after battling stoically against illness. His record label, Quiet Arch, was already planning to go into hiatus due to his illness and had planned a farewell gig in the Belfast Empire for that very evening. As fate would have it, it became his wake. I am a firm believer in the human spirit being how people remember you and I prefer to gather other people’s memories for things like this. Ryan Vail: “The man that gave me a career in music, toured me around the world, put me on tv, put me on radio, made me a headline festival artist, got me sound tracking, got me remixing, got me producing, got me talking on some of the most important industry , got me the most prestigious funding awards my manager, friend, label partnerLyndon Stephens.“I was his very first signing nine years ago and stayed with him the whole time. We released together, toured together started labels together, found acts together and had hours of phone calls together daily. “To be honest it’s been so so dficult to comprehend. Im really grateful for the memories we shared together.“RIP Lyndon, thank you for changing my le”Ciaran Lavery: “I first met Lyndon Stephens at Output, Belfast. He didn’t know me or owe me anything but kept putting me forward to talk to the local press that were at the event. “After the show, he askedI’d like to chat to him about working together. “Over the course of the next five years we broke down so many walls and glass ceilings. We spoke on the phone three for four times a day every day. I could call him at ungodly hours and he always answered, he was always there, Lyndon loved to talk. He was an incredible human being with a wonderful family and friends circle. “I know that when any friend musician needed advice of funding I pointed them towards Lyndon andhe had the time, he gave it willingly. I have an incredible amount of memories. I will miss my old friend so dearly, but in truth, I am truly blessed to have met Lyndon Stephens”.Francesca O’Connor, from Quiet Arch ,said “Lyndon Stephens, a man who wanted to make a genuine dference to this world, give the underdogs a  to shine and to show the world the incredible talent coming out of Northern Ireland. “He set up an artist management company, Champion Sound Music and record label, Quiet Arch, to put Northern Ireland artists on the international stage. I will forever be grateful to him for hiring me as a trainee artist manager . years ago. “As a young female with little experience but an eagerness to learn, he gave me a chance. I can only take inspiration from his creativity, decisiveness, determination and unwavering passion to succeed to carry on what he started. “Not long ago, he sent me the poem Go All The Way by Charles Bukowski and I cant think of a better way to describe his tenacious spirit.” She concluded: A loving husband, father, sister and friend, Lyndon is undoubtedly one in a million and will never be forgotten”.Ben Magee, also of Quiet Arch said “Lyndon’s biggest strength, and of those he had many, was when he believed in you, you knew about it. He was never one to shower you with praise, butyou had Lyndon in your corner, he made you feel like you could conquer the world. “A profound, hilarious inidual who was always one step ahead of everyone  in the room, Lyndon never spent a second of his le saying goodbye. “He always had his eyes fixed squarely on the horizon, eyebrows raised, a mad cackle dancing on the corner of his mouth. He was a mentor, a confidant, an always open ear and a friend. And I will miss him dearly.”My memories of Lyndon are very similar to Ciaran’s and probably most other people’s. he was always willing to help and preferred to talk over the other means of communication. If I ever went off the deep end with one of my rants at the music scene here Lyndon would message me quickly to calmly explain how things worked and how I might be right but mostly how I was wrong. It always began with a text message but was always swtly abandoned in favour of a chat. Always knowledgeable and always reasonable I will truly miss the advice and am forever grateful for the counsel. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She was keen to help those in need and to get people involved.Making time for others, she had a listening ear and often offered advice in compassionate ways. She liked being at the heart of things, and she was the le and soul of the party.Helena, from the Crocknamohil Road close to Draperstown, went missing on November .She was last seen near the Foyle Bridge in Derry city.Her remains were discovered last Tuesday evening by search teams on the River Foyle, who had been scouring the area every day since her disappearance. Her family, including husband Declan and four children - Kayla, Ben, Kaeden andNiah-Rose - all aged from one to  years-old, had held out hope she wouldhome.On Monday morning they gathered with hundreds of others in a final farewell to the much loved daughter, sister, mum and we.Special recognition was given during the funeral mass from the McElhennon and McGlone families for the tireless, daily efforts by family, friends and strangers in looking for Helena.Passing on their thanks, Fr McGirr said: Over these past number of weeks Helena has been on the minds and in the prayers of countless people across our erse, good-hearted and generous community. Helena’s people also deeply appreciate the supportive messages from people conveyed across dferent s expressing their compassion and kindest thoughts.People were keen to help and pray for Helena. They have been opening their hearts and sharing their moments with a neighbour and people they’re feeling for. “They and the generosity of local businesses donating food for volunteers and family members also helped to draw Helena gently home.As sincere people and as a community of faith gathered here at St Patrick’s, we share our sympathy with everyone among Helena’s family and friends grieving her passing today. We also reach out to God to help and console us in our sorrow, and we pray to him for the happy repose of Helena’s soul in the le to come, because we would like her to have that peace very much.”Yesterday, messages of support continued to be posted on a Facebook page set up in the search for Helena.As well as offers of thoughts and prayers, messages lent support for her family and expressed relief that their agonising search had finally come to an end. Last week after news that Helenas body had been foud, her family thanked those who had left comforting messages. “Helena was a beautul person and earth angel. She’s now an angel in heaven reunited with our Daddy, goddaughter and other family members,” a Facebook post read. Helena is survived by her husband Declan and four children, her mother Mary and her siblings Rosaleen, Teresa, Michael and Sean.For emotional support you can call the Samaritans -hour helpline on  , email jo@samaritans.org, visit a Samaritans branch in person or go to the Samaritans website. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is focussing on four constituencies - Cavan, Wexford, Donegal and the retention of the Meath West seat. ,However, Cllr McCloskey said she felt it was important to stand in Sligo Leitrim. Aontuacute is a fledgling political party, she said. We have a group of very committed activists in Sligo who were very keen for someone to stand. The constituency takes in all of counties Sligo and Leitrim, part of southern Donegal and part of northern Roscommon.” googletag.cmd.push  Peter Casey Cllr McCloskey said the party had a “mountain to climb” with just over two weeks to polling day on  February but she was “looking forward to the challenge.” Cllr McCloskey claimed the party had gained supporters from across the political spectrum, including from the unionist community. Aontuacute was established last year after Peadar Toacuteibiacuten left Sinn Feacutein. He claimed he had been ostracised from the party because of his opposition to abortion. Several high-profile former Sinn Feacutein members, including Francie and Anne Brolly, later joined the party. Aontuacute claimed three seats in last years local elections in the Republic.If elected, Cllr McCloskey would be expected to stand down from her seat on Derry City and Strabane District Council.Meanwhile, former Presidential candidate Peter Casey this week revealed his intention to stand as a General Election candidate in Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s constituency.Mr Casey, who lives in Greencastle in Inishowen, had already filed papers to stand in Donegal, revealed he nominated himself to stand in Dublin West.The businessman finished second behind Michael D Higgins in the  Presidential race, when he drew controversy over his remarks about the Travelling community.He also unsuccessfully stood for European Parliament in the Midlands-North West constituency last year. Announcing his candidacy, Mr Casey said he was standing in the Dublin constituency to give people an opportunity to register “an obvious protest vote” against Varadkar.“The Taoiseach’s string of failures is recorded for all to see,” he said.“There’s the swing-gate and fobgate scandals, the National Children’s Hospital disgrace, the broadband spending debacle, the unprecedented crises in health and housing – list goes on and people have had enough… “People are right to be angry and that’s why I’m giving them the opportunity to voice their anger directly by voting for me in Dublin West.”Speaking at the registration office, the -year-old said he believed Mr Varadkar was not fit to be Taoiseach, but said he would not canvas there, adding that his primary goal would be to represent the people of Donegal.As well as the Taoiseach, Mr Casey will face competition for the Dublin constituency’s four seats from outgoing TDs Joan Burton of Labour, Fianna Faacuteil’s Jack Chambers, and Solidarity-People Before Profit’s Ruth Coppinger.Others standing in the constituency include Fine Gael’s Emer Currie, Sinn Feacutein’s Paul Donnelly, the Green Party’s Roderic O’Gorman, Aengus Oacute Maolaacutein, Aontuacute’s Edward Mac Manus and independent candidates Stephen O’Loughlin and Sean O’Leary. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Reverend David Latimer is retiring after  years as a minister at First Derry Presbyterian Church. Reverend Latimer came to prominence in the last decade through his friendship with Sinn Fein politician and former IRA man Martin McGuinness. The two men first met when Reverend Latimer appealed to Mr McGuinness to condemn a vandalism attack on First Derry church at Magazine Street in Derrys city centre. From that first meeting developed a friendship between the two men which attracted admiration and criticism. Reverend Latimer has spoken of how some of his congregation who had lost loved ones at the hands of the IRA could not accept his friendship with Mr McGuinness, who died in . googletag.cmd.push However, the local clergyman, who was originally from County Down, said that his relationship with Mr McGuinness was part of a reconciliation process between dferent communities. That theme was evident today at Reverend Latimers final Sunday service at First Derry church. Among the packed congregation were members of Mr McGuinnesss family along with leading Sinn Fein figures.

Patients registered to a MDT practice are able to book an appointment directly with any of these new services, without first having to see their GP. The model also includes signicant investment in additional nursing specialist roles such as health visiting and district nursing.The Derry GP Federation was one of the first areas in Northern Ireland to benefit from this transformation initiative. Since its introduction, just over one year ago, over , patient appointments have taken place with these new MDT staff.The project has recruited signicant numbers of additional staff to work within GP practices. Seventy two staff are already in post and  more are due to start in coming months. To accommodate these additional staff, a signicant programme of capital investment in the buildings which house GP practices has been accompanying the project.Dr Martin McCloskey, chairperson of the Derry Federation of Family Practices, said the introduction of the initiative in the Derry area had resulted in an increase in capacity in GP practices. “The approach sees our practice teams being supported to identy opportunities for early intervention, with an increased focus on the physical, mental and social wellbeing of our communities. We are now beginning to see the rewards and are confident that MDTs will not only improve the health and well being of our local communities but help to secure the future of general practice in the North West.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Stute also drew a blank in terms of goals for the seventh time in that period, and with Warrenpoint grabbing a late win at Carrick, the Blues have now slipped to last place after several weeks of treading water.It is a concerning time for Connor and his and with a game against the Point just a few weeks away, they will be hoping to get a win out of somewhere before that huge six-pointer.Whilst Stute improved in the second half of Saturdays game, they did not do enough to test home goalkeeper Conor Byrne throughout, and not for the first time this season, indiscipline in their own penalty area cost them as they conceded yet another penalty. Connor made a number of changes as he tried to freshen things up, bringing in Conor Tourish, Cormac Burke and Ahu Obhakhan for Evan Tweed, Oran Brogan and Alex Pomeroy, who all dropped to the bench.New signing Obhakhan almost gted Dungannon a goal as early as the fourth minute as his pass found Caolan McAleer, but the ex-Finn Harps mans long range drive failed to trouble Stute goalkeeper Rory Brown. The last two games between these sides had been memorable for all sorts of reasons, but this was not following suit as both teams struggled for inspiration, half chances falling for Dungannon as Terry Fitzpatricks tame effort was easily gathered by a ing Brown before the Stute goalkeeper saved from Hughes from distance. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -Stute upped their efforts after the break and they finally tested the hosts when Joe McCreadys low drive was saved at the second attempt by Swts keeper Byrne.That was the beginning of the best period in the game for the visitors and just before the hour mark Currys header from Burkes left wing corner caused problems for Swts, who somehow scrambled the ball awya from danger. Stutres vulnerability at set-plays cost them dearly just after the hour mark when Dungannon finally broke through, McAleers cross finding King at the back post who powerfully headed home. That changed the momentum of the game and the lead was doubled just over ten minutes later when Tourish brought down McAleer inside the box, leaving referee Tony Clarke with no option but to point to the spot. Douglas Wilson made no mistake with the resulting penalty, drilling the ball low into Browns bottom left hand corner to seal the points. Stute had no answer and Swts should have added a third when Hughes fed an unmarked McAleer, but with only Brown to beat, the winger fired wide with the goal at his mercy.In the closing stages Gareth Brown went close to grabbing a consolation as his snap-shot beat Byrne but flashed just wide. googletag.cmd.push TeamsDungannon Swts: Byrne, Lowe, Wilson, King, Teggart Campbell, Fitzpatrick , Smyth , McAleer Carvill, Hughes .Institute: R Brown, Morrow, Tourish, D Curry, McLaughlin G Brown, McCauley , Crown, BurkeMcCready , Obhakhan.Referee: Tony Clarke .

The children work effectively and take personal responsibility for working collaboratively with their peers.ldquoThey seek and respect fully the views and opinions of each other, and take great pride in sharing their learning with others.The report also said that the childrenrsquos behaviour was ldquoexemplary and described the outcomes for children in literary, numeracy and ICT and the schoolrsquos leadership as ldquooutstanding.Cumran PS was also praised for achieving ICT awards, which included the Digital School of Distinction Award, the Capital Excellence Award and two National Association of Advisors for Computers in Education.It has also been accredited as a lsquoThinking Schoolrsquo, a rights respecting school at silver level and an ambassador Eco School, holding an eighth green flag.School principal, Mrs Rhonda Moles, said she and the staff were delighted.ldquoCumran has yet again achieved the lsquooutstandingrsquo category in every area mdash the quality of education provided,quality of the childrenrsquos achievements and standards, the provision for learning, leadership and management and pastoral care.Mrs Moles said Cumran Primary is committed to providing the best possible education for children, with the inspection report recognising that the children are at the heart of all decision making in school and that they lead the learning.She added: ldquoThis is a great affirmation for all in the school community and identies Cumran as being at the forefront of primary education.ldquoI would like to thank the hard working and committed staff, the supportive governors and parents and highly motivated children for making our school the success it is.Cumran opened as a new school in May  following the amalgamation of Clough and Downshire Primary Schools..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Charity.jpg","title":"Charity encouraging children to walk or take bike to school  ","story":"A LOCAL politician is encouraging more children to walk or cycle to school mdashit is safe to do so.Rowallane politician Billy Walker is supportive of the drive by Sustrans to reduce the number of children travelling to school by car, but warns that for many who attend primary schools in rural areas especially, walking or cycling to school could place them in danger.Sustrans mdash which is a walking and cycling charity mdash said recent figures published by the Department for Infrastructure show that increasing numbers of children travel to school by car.Anne Madden from Sustrans described the increasing number as ldquotruly woeful and said the fact that the number of primary children being driven to school has risen from % to % since   shows ldquosociety has a lot more to do.She says it is known from surveys that road safety is the main reason why parents drive their children to school, but the charity official said it is these parents who are adding to congestion and air pollution at the school gates.Ms Madden says there needs to be improvements in infrastructure such as footpaths and traffic crossings to enable more active travel.The latest government figures have revealed that as many as % of primary school pupils who are being driven to school live less than a mile away, which Ms Madden describes as a ldquovery walkable distance.She added: ldquoWalking or cycling to school is a simple way of incorporating more exercise into a childrsquos daily routine. This can help tackle both the obesity epidemic and improve childrenrsquos overall health and well-being.The Active School Travelprogramme which Sustrans delivers has successfully increased the number of pupils walking, cycling and scooting to school, with the charity explaining that it takes on  new schools each year.However, it says the programme needs to expand and provide more long-term support to school communities in order to turn around these statistics.In the   period, the number of children walking, cycling and scooting to school in the AST programme increased from % to % while, at the same time, the number of pupils being driven to school fell from % to %.Cllr Walker says he is ldquoall for getting more children to walk to school, but explained that in some parts of Down District, this simply isnrsquot possible as in many rural areas there are no footpaths. In addition, he said there are no dedicated cycle paths.ldquoI fully support the work of Sustrans and have worked with the charity on a number of schemes in my own area, he revealed.ldquoI recognise that the more children who walk to school, the less congestion there will be and fewer cars sitting in traffic queues pumping dangerous fumes into the atmosphere.Cllr Walker said mph zones have been introduced outside some local schools, calling for such schemes to be rolled out across all council areas.He added: ldquoWith the emphasis now on people taking more responsibility for their own health and getting fitter, encouraging children to walk to school when it is safe to do so will sew the seed of keeping healthy from an early age and this will stay with them for the rest of their lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Delay.jpg","title":"Delay for development meeting on Irish Street  ","story":"AN event designed to provide business owners in Downpatrick with an input into plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings has been delayed.Originally scheduled to take place before Christmas the meeting was delayed in the wake of the snap Westminster election, with hopes that it would go ahead this month.Now it has emerged that it could be February or March before what is being viewed as one of the most signicant town centre regeneration meetings ever to take place in the district takes place.A number of Downpatrick councillors were recently given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear which will feature heavily in the proposed redevelopment scheme.The old police base enjoys protected status and therefore cannot be razed to the ground to pave the way for any new development. As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development. Redeveloping the expansive Irish Street site can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment and will provide a boost for existing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down senior footballers face tough opener  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS senior footballers head for Clonmel on Sunday more in hope than optimism to open their Division  Allianz League campaign against Tipperary.Paddy Tallyrsquos charges face a tough opening game as the Premier County, who were relegated from Division  last season, will be like a wounded animal and determined to bounce back into the leaguersquos second tier.The sides met last June at Pairc Esler when Down won an All-Ireland Qualier - to -. Pat Havern, Corey Quinn and Donal OrsquoHare did most of the scoring that day, but Tipperary will be a dferent proposition at the weekend.New Tipp manager David Power, who famously led the county minors to an All-Ireland title in , has an abundance of talent at his disposal, but he will have to without star player Michael Quinlivan.The Clonmel Commercials man has decided to go travelling for a year and his absence is a huge loss to Tipperaryrsquos attack and the countyrsquos bid to regain their status in the top flight ahead of next seasonrsquos championship changes.Promotion is also a must for Down as well, as they too have huge aspirations of avoiding competing in the All-Ireland second tier competition.Down have just emerged from an indferent McKenna Cup campaign.Wins over Fermanagh and Antrim were cast aside when Tallyrsquos team were given a reality check by Tyrone in the semi-finals.Mickey Hartersquos experimental side simply over-powered Down and had too much physicality all over the park.Hopefully, Down will have learned from that game, but second guessing Tallyrsquos team selection ahead of Sunday is a dficult job.Definitely missing Sundayrsquos game will be vice-captain Caolan Mooney, the one player in the camp who has the ability to stand out from the rest. His unavailability through injury is a severe blow to Tallyrsquos aspirationsJohn OrsquoHare and Marc Hynes shared the goalkeeping duties in the two McKenna Cup games, but Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns is still considered as the county number one.Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Burrenrsquos Kevin McKernan and Warrenpointrsquos Ryan McAleenan could well man the full back berths with Annaclonersquos Brendan McArdle also in the frame.A knee injury for Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty, picked up against Tyrone, could rule him out of action, but Daniel Guinness could well fill in for him at right half back. Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night. Second was st Ballyroney, with st Raffrey finishing third.This is the most prestigious event in the Battalion calendar and a very high standard of drill was set by the locals, who have been practicing the movements for the past four months.Apart from the squad competition, there was also a squad commandant cup presented at Banbridge and Sgt M Cuffey, of Crossgar, was the winner.The overall competition was chaired by Mr D Partridge, Battalion president, assisted by Mr R Dickson, Battalion secretary.

Apart from a travelling scholarship he once won to study design, this is undoubtedly Mr Wilkinsonrsquos first big success.ldquoIt was one occasion when I believed designers should make a real effort to present a project. I entered it, wanting to do the best I could. Naturally I aimed to win itpossible, Mr Mr Wilkinson.He received pound from the Environment Minister Mr Philip Goodhart on Tuesday.

They say they are simply removing mercury out of the rotating lens system and putting in a new ldquoinnovative mechanical bearing solution, insisting that the changes are not being driven by any

rotating lens which was installed in .Commissioners also insist that the range of the new LED light will be  miles in accordance with the Navigation Requirements for the UK and Ireland, with St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse continuing to provide an essential safety service for mariners as it has done since a light was first established in Killough in .During a public meeting last year to discuss the proposed changes at the lighthouse, CIL was urged by concerned residents and politicians to leave the lighthouse as it is and not to do anything to harm its heritage.There was also a warning that there would be ldquoructions at all levelsthe proposed changes were implemented, with several people pointing to the potential for the lighthouse to be transformed into a unique leading

geopark bid  ","story":"A NEW management team has been established to oversee three stunning areas of outstanding natural beauty which are at the heart of the districtrsquos bid to secure a world renowned tourism designation.Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion feature heavily in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for prestigious UNESCO geopark status which has the potential to generate millions of pounds in tourism revenue.Typical activities in geoparks include the development of walking and cycling trails, training local people to act as guides, the provision of information signs and the development of visitor centres.Northern Irelandrsquos only other current geopark mdash the Marble Arch Caves which inhabits the rugged mountainous uplands and gentle rolling lowlands of counties Cavan and Fermanagh mdash contributes just over poundm to the economy in this area.Local council officials, who confirmed a pre-Christmas Recorder story that the formal bid for geopark status had been submitted, have revealed that an Area of Outstanding Natural Beautymanagement team for the three local areas has been created.Council officials say that they are continuing to work secure geopark status which is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism.But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious geopark designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with those behind the bid confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors in particular.But securing geopark status is not just about delivering financial benefit.Geoparks in other areas have empowered local communities, providing them with opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.If the local bid for geopark status for a huge swathe of land covering Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion is successful, the international designation is expected to play a key role in helping transform the local economy.The geopark brand will use the geological heritage of the three areas to develop sustainable tourism that generates economic benefits, while providing recreational opportunities and increased awareness of the arearsquos natural assets, working with landowners, businesses and communities.The ultimate aim of a geopark is to enhance the economy and develop employment opportunities for the people who live there, but the global brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a so-called bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020

The tourism season in Newcastle is now all-year long and we want to keep the car-park open.Cllr Devlin said that the council was ldquoa victim of its own success in being able to attract the numbers of visitors to the town.She questioned the proposalrsquos contention that Newcastlersquos parking demand ldquosignicantly decreases during the winter months.ldquoIt used to be that we would have parking problems during particular times such as the Festival of Flight and bank holidays. But now as long as its dry, Newcastle is busy and parking is a necessary part of the town centre, she said.ldquoWhen the overflow car park is not being used, itrsquos complete chaos and parking can create issues for residents in nearby folds.She asked council officers when the new overflow car-park would be open for business andthe current overflow area could be kept open in the interim to help with parking demand.Michael Lipsett, the councilrsquos director of active and healthy communities, said he envisaged the work lasting three months and promised that once the necessary planning approval was gained, his department would be preparing to tender for a contractor as soon as possible.Slieve Croob Cllr Andrew McMurray queried whether the car-park would be a ldquoblanket tarmac covering andit would encroach on the green space.He was told that the proposal was to use a synthetic grid which would allow grass to show through so it would look green but would also indicate the car spaces available and one-way traffic system planned.Mournes Cllr Harold McKee welcomed the development as a ldquogreat idea and said parking in Newcastle was ldquoan absolute nightmare at any time of the year.Cllr Devlin suggested that the current overflow parking area should be in continuous use until the new facility is opened.However, Mr Lipsett said he currently did not have the budget available to cover this but would investigate and report back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Philip.jpg","title":"Philip and Helen in tandem at Kildare  ","story":"ON a bitterly cold Saturday morning Phillip and Helen Vint were at the start line for the latest in the East of Ireland Marathon series, at Staplestown, in North Kildare, which also provides half marathon and k alternatives, mostly for partners, like Helen who feel itrsquos nice to be there to support your other half, but who feel that running a marathon with them is pushing things a bit too far, . miles too far to be exact.The temperature was -C when they began running and a sultry +C when they finished and underfoot conditions were slippery by virtue of the frozen ice around the route.So, well done to both on completing what they describe as steady runs for their firsts of , Phillip in .. and fth place and Helen in .. and third place respectively.BornRunSaturday saw a big turnout,  in fact, for the sixth of the BornRun Run Forest Run Series.This week the venue was Gosford Country Park which will also host the NI  Ulster Intermediate and Masters Cross Country Championships next weekend.The only distance on offer this week was k and the route headed out in a loop around the start and continued towards the outer boundaries of the forest.The first k was quite level and took everyone into the scenic forest for k where there were a few small inclines, but overall it was a flat, fast course with a good run in the last k down to the finish line.No-one made better use of the terrain than East Downrsquos Jimmy Sloan, who fairly flew round the course in a superb ., which was almost two minutesahead of the second-placed Thomas Carson . with third place filled by Barry McAuley in ..I believe this is Jimmyrsquos first win in club colours and it certainly wonrsquot be his last, given his present form and continuing improvement, which in spite of hearing later that the distance was allegedly  metres short, nevertheless represents a great effort and time.

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting.

I’ve loved being a listener as well as a singer.”As a producer Paul has put together a number of music videos for Infinity which the band use to showcase their abilities to potential customers, that is, brides and grooms to be.Not unlike the mainstream music industry wedding bands are trying to stand out from the crowd and land regular headline slots.Paul said: “The wedding industry is massive. There’s a lot of competition. We have to step it up. We’re always pushing to be better. “We make music videos so people can see what we do. One of the first songs we recorded was a cover of Ed Sheeran’s Perfect. People wanted to book us for their wedding because of that promotional video.“It put us on the map a little bit. Ed Sheeran isn’t all bad.“Perfect has been the most popular songs for a first dance in the last couple of years.”Discussing first dances, Paul said: “We have a massive repertoire of slow songs, hopefully the bride and groom pick something that we do really well. If not there’s the challenge of preparing a stripped back version of their favourite songs that’s suitable for a first dance.“That’s the thing about first dances. Sometimes you’re learning a song you’ll only sing once. “I remember being asked to do a rave song for a first dance. It was Set You Free by N-Trance. I thought, ‘phew, how am I going to do a rave song for a first dance ’ In the end you just have to look at the chord structure, slow it down. We did it with just piano and vocals, it was really pretty. I’ll probably never sing it again so I guess you had to be at that particular wedding.”He continued: “We’re looking all the time at what’s doing well, what’s popular, what are people reacting to, what kind of groove are people dancing to.“You can’t beat the old songs like Walk Of Le, Stevie Wonder, classic rock, Bruce Springsteen, ZZ Top. Young and old know that.“In this part of the world you have country music, both American and Irish, and folk music that goes down well.“We leave Rock The Boat to the DJ.”Paul said he was just as comfortable being a wedding singer as he was as a solo artist: “I get to put on a nice suit and stand on a big stage in front of three or four hundred people.“It is great to be on stage and see all those people dancing, having the time of their lives in front of you.“You’re making it happen, that’s my job. That’s what we have to do, that’s what we strive to do well.“For me, what’s the alternative, to try and be a great artist and never make it  I’d rather be in the music business, be working as a musician, to me that’s the most important.“There’s regular work as a wedding band. We can be looking at  to  weddings a year.“As a musician I’ve done all sorts of gigs, sometimes you could be in a room of  people and those people could just be loving everything you’re doing. Other times it can be tough. I don’t mind because I love playing music.“Just because you’re playing a wedding doesn’t guarantee people will be up dancing. You become a good improviser, you need topeople aren’t dancing.”Paul said to be in a wedding band you had to rethink your priorities: “As a wedding singer you have to be adaptable. I can’t be saying. ‘this is what I like, I don’t care what you like’. It’s not about me, it’s about me trying to do the job well. The same for the other guys in the band.”He added: “It’s never completely comfortable. There’s always a bit of pressure. Then you’ve got the camera stuck in your face as well. You’re part of the wedding. There’s no room for mistakes.”Paul said that almost all his weekends were spent on the road with the band.He said: “Thursday to Sunday you’re out on the road and during the busier months of the year you could be doing a wedding on a Monday night, Tuesday night.“We do the odd full day wedding. I’ll sing an acoustic set in the afternoon then a big set at night. Those are harder and harde to do. If you’re doing three of those in a row you’re getting no sleep and your show’s going to be affected by that.“Most of the time we’ll do a two or two and half hour live show and there’s an hour disco from Rory afterwards. We find that we’re there for the whole night. That’s our usual package.“You play to am. You’re getting home at four in the morning a lot of the time depending where you’re playing. We do a lot of gigs in Donegal and Monaghan, Dundalk, Drogheda, down the Athlone, the Midlands area. It’s a few extra hours on the road, but we’ll not rule anywhere out.“It’s a le we’re well used to. What  would you be doing ”Reflecting on the change in his musical career Paul said: “As a solo artist who had management and was bringing out singles I just didn’t get lucky, it can come down to who you know and not how good you are.“I feel like I’m a better singer now, being in a wedding band, working so much and pushing myself so much to be good at what I do has made me better.“I feel more confident in myself now, people probably respect me a bit dferently as a wedding singer. I’m working all the time. I’m very dedicated to what I do. I don’t drink, don’t smoke.“What’s the alternative  Go and try to be the next Lewis Capaldi. Yes, you can try but the chances are you’ll be doing a gig every other week and have no money.”He said: “You need to leave your ego in the house, for me it’s just about going out and playing good music. It’s all about that crowd, making their day, making that bride and that groom and their family happy.“We’ve all been to those weddings were the band have been awful, it’s been a real drag. We striving to not be that band. It’s a wedding. People should be having the night of their lives.”Askedhe attending any weddings other than those he sings at, he said: “I’ve been at a few family weddings but I’ll be with the band. Infinity will play their wedding, that’s my gt to them.”He added: “I’ve never married. I’m married to the music. If I ever did I’d have to play my own wedding. I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it. At the minute I wouldn’t even have the time to get married.”try catch  TrendingNI snow due to arrive earlier than originally thought - gales now expected too as temperatures set to plummet to -degCPSNI confirm route slow moving ambulance will take - motorists urged to remain patientNI Snow Alert: Experts predict snowfall for next week - subzero temperatures expected across NINI snow alert: Snowfall and ice worse than originally thought - Met Office issue yellow status warning - temperatures to plummet to bitterly cold -degC with risk of gale-force winds tooTwo PSNI officers in hospital after horric attack        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"People\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"mot test temporary exemptions outlined by infrastructure minister to drivers whose certificates have expired  ","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

School budgets are under severe pressure and we need to ensure our teachers receive the level of pay they deserve.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year. Thanks should also go to the local businesses who supported and Irsquod like to encourage residents to visit their local business to support Small Business Saturday. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent.

This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in. It’s tried and tested.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
